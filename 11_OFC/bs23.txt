What kind of information will visible with this report(primally):
	1. Request Fail Percentage
	2. 24 Hr's Request Status Counts
	3. Service RTT


Task Plan: Data Analysis and Reporting with be done below step.

Task Plan: Data Analysis and Reporting

Step 1: Row Data Source Identification

	QuickStart Guide for Production-ready Spring Cloud Microservice

	QuickStart Guide for Production-ready Microservice with Spring Cloud

Medium to Enterprise disribution solution or any Microservice Architecture  commonly use Tech java-Spring-cloud   
For Starting a brand new Project then: How to desing the Architecture with Spring-cloud and How it work
For finding this question answer need to read a lot of documentation and RND what is take loatof time and effor.

In this case:
	Who going to start design and Build a Microservice:
	or
	New resource on boding to a projecct
	
If the Person Go throw on this Guid, 
	he/she will clear about how Spring-Cloud work
	Got an Idea how to design and implement Production Grade microservice Architecture.

This how this QuickStart Guide saveing a lot of time and cost for many of our BS developer.
