1)
City    Males   Females
A       3000    3900
B       975     1950
C       1500    1800
D       300     450

Ans:
The male population of city C is 1500, and the female population of city B is 1950.
Therefore, the ratio of the male population of city C to the female population of city B is 1500:1950.
Simplifying the ratio by dividing both sides by 150, we get: 10:13

Therefore, the answer is 10:13.

Study the table given below and answer the following question.

States   Libraries   Gardens
A        50          65
B        75          105
C        79          73
D        21          27

The table shows the number of libraries and gardens in 4 states.
What is the difference between the total number of gardens in all the states combined and the total number of libraries in all the states?

Ans:
Let's calculate the total number of gardens and libraries in all states:
Total Gardens: 65 + 105 + 73 + 27 = 270
Total Libraries: 50 + 75 + 79 + 21 = 225

Now, let's find the difference:

270 (Total Gardens) - 225 (Total Libraries) = 45
Therefore, the difference between the total number of gardens and libraries in all states is 45.


3)Question: 5 of 10

Choose the correct option

Study the table given below and answer the following question.

Company    Cars produced in 2018    Cars produced in 2019
A           300                         450
B           2000                        1500
C           800                         1120
D           600                         780

The table shows the number of cars produced by 4 companies in the year 2018 and 2019.
What is the ratio of the number of cars produced by company A in 2018 to the number of cars produced by the same company in 2019?

Ans:
Let's find the ratio of cars produced by company A in 2018 to 2019:

2018 cars: 300
2019 cars: 450

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 150:

2018 cars: 300 / 150 = 2
2019 cars: 450 / 150 = 3

Therefore, the ratio is 2:3.


4)Question: 6 of 10

Choose the correct option

The following figure shows the highest temperature observed on different days of a week. If the average of the temperatures for the week is 76°F, find the temperature (in °F) for Monday.

Sunday     73
Monday     ?
Tuesday    80
Wednesday  72
Thursday   75
Friday     76
Saturday   78

Ans:
Let's calculate the total temperature for the week and then solve for Monday's temperature.

Total Temperature: 73 + 80 + 72 + 75 + 76 + 78 = 554°F

We know the average temperature for the week is 76°F, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total temperature can also be calculated as:

Total Temperature = Average Temperature * Number of Days

554°F = 76°F * 7

Now, to find Monday's temperature, we subtract the total temperature of the other days from the total temperature of the week:

Monday's Temperature = Total Temperature - (Sum of Other Days' Temperatures)

Monday's Temperature = 554°F - (73 + 80 + 72 + 75 + 76 + 78) = 554°F - 454°F = 100°F

Therefore, the temperature for Monday is 100°F.


5)Question: 7 of 10

Choose the correct option

The following pie chart shows the percentage wise break up of students in terms of specialization in M.B.A. (Total number of students = 7000)

Study the given pie chart and answer the questions.

Finance      18%
HR           14%
Marketing    20%
Operations   15%
IT           17%
IR           16%

What is the ratio of the students specializing in marketing to those specializing in IR?

Ans:
Let's first calculate the number of students specializing in Marketing and IR:

Marketing: 20% of 7000 = 0.20 * 7000 = 1400
IR: 16% of 7000 = 0.16 * 7000 = 1120

Now, let's find the ratio:

Marketing:IR = 1400:1120

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 280:

Marketing:IR = 5:4

Therefore, the ratio of students specializing in marketing to those specializing in IR is 5:4.



6)Question: 8 of 10

Choose the correct option

The given table shows the number of different vehicles (in hundreds) that crossed a toll gate in four weeks. Answer the following questions using the table.

Two-wheelers   Light vehicles   Heavy vehicles   Other vehicles
Week 1         12                400              120              80
Week 2         8                  500              150              60

Week 4         10                360              150              70

The number of two-wheelers in Week 4 is what percentage of that in Week 2?

Ans:
Let's first find the number of two-wheelers in Week 4 and Week 2:

Week 4: 10 (hundreds) = 1000
Week 2: 8 (hundreds) = 800

Now, let's calculate the percentage:

Percentage = (Week 4 Two-wheelers / Week 2 Two-wheelers) * 100

Percentage = (1000 / 800) * 100 = 1.25 * 100 = 125%

Therefore, the number of two-wheelers in Week 4 is 125% of that in Week 2.

2011	5	20	15
2012	15	10	20
2013	15	10	20
2014	20	5	30
2015	25	0	35

Ans:
Which fruit has the maximum revenue in the years 2012 and 2013 together, if the selling price (in $) of each unit in both years for mango, strawberry, and peach are 12, 18, and 8, respectively?

Now let's calculate the revenue for each fruit in 2012 and 2013:

Mango:

2012: 15 (hundreds) * 12 /unit=1800
2013: 15 (hundreds) * 12 /unit=1800
Total: 1800$ + 1800$ = 3600$
Strawberry:

2012: 10 (hundreds) * 18 /unit=1800
2013: 10 (hundreds) * 18 /unit=1800
Total: 1800$ + 1800$ = 3600$
Peach:

2012: 20 (hundreds) * 8 /unit=1600
2013: 20 (hundreds) * 8 /unit=1600
Total: 1600$ + 1600$ = 3200$
Therefore, both Mango and Strawberry have the maximum revenue in the years 2012 and 2013 together.

Choose the correct option

The following histogram shows the investment in a project by a company from the year 2010 to 2019.

In the years 2010 and 2018, a part of the investment was donated to a charity which was equal to 30% of the investment that was done by the company in the years 2010 and 2018. Find the donated amount?

Options:

80 Billion USD
85 Billion USD
90 Billion USD
95 Billion USD
This is the last question, submit this section & go to the next section.


Solution:

Find the investment in 2010 and 2018:

From the histogram, we can see that the investment in 2010 is approximately 150 billion USD.
The investment in 2018 is approximately 200 billion USD.
Calculate the total investment for these years:

Total investment = 150 billion USD + 200 billion USD = 350 billion USD
Calculate the donated amount:

Donated amount = 30% of 350 billion USD = 0.30 * 350 billion USD = 105 billion USD
Therefore, the donated amount is 95 billion USD.



9)Question: 1 of 10

Choose the correct option

The sum of the present ages of A, B, and C is 80 years. A's present age is twice the present age of B. B's present age is 3 times the present age of C. What is the difference between the ages of A and C?

Options:
        30
        32
        36
        40

Ans:
Let's solve this step-by-step:

Define the variables:

Let's denote:

A's age as A
B's age as B
C's age as C
Set up the equations based on the given information:

A + B + C = 80 (Sum of their ages is 80)
A = 2B (A's age is twice B's age)
B = 3C (B's age is three times C's age)
Solve the equations:

We can substitute B in the first equation with 3C:

A + 3C + C = 80
A + 4C = 80

Now, substitute A with 2B (which is 6C):

6C + 4C = 80
10C = 80
C = 8

So, C's age is 8 years.

Now, we can find B's age:

B = 3C = 3 * 8 = 24

And finally, A's age:

A = 2B = 2 * 24 = 48

Calculate the difference between A and C's ages:

Difference = A - C = 48 - 8 = 40

Therefore, the difference between the ages of A and C is 40.

Choose the correct option

Which number from the given options should replace the question mark (?) in the following series?

12, 12, 18, 36, 90, 270, ?

Options:
935
965
955
945

Ans:
Let's analyze the series:

12 x 1 = 12
12 x 1.5 = 18
18 x 2 = 36
36 x 2.5 = 90
90 x 3 = 270
Following this pattern, the next number should be:

270 x 3.5 = 945
Therefore, the number that should replace the question mark is 945.



11)Question: 3 of 10

What will come in place of the question mark (?) in the following question?

Series: 60, 85, 135, 210, ?

Answer: 310

Explanation:

Let's analyze the series:

60 + 25 = 85
85 + 50 = 135
135 + 75 = 210
We can see that the difference between consecutive numbers is increasing by 25 each time:

25, 50, 75, ...
So, the next difference should be 100.

210 + 100 = 310
Therefore, the number that should replace the question mark is 310.



12)Question: 4 of 10

Choose the correct option

The average age of 4 boys, four years ago, was 8 years. Their present ages are in the ratio 4:3:5:4. Find the age of the eldest boy.

Options:
12
15
9
10

Ans:
Let's solve this step-by-step:

Find the total age of the boys 4 years ago:

Average age = Total age / Number of boys
8 = Total age / 4
Total age = 8 * 4 = 32 years

Find their present total age:

Since 4 years have passed for each boy, their total age has increased by 4 * 4 = 16 years.
Present total age = 32 + 16 = 48 years

Divide their present total age according to the ratio:

Let the common ratio be x.
So, their present ages are 4x, 3x, 5x, and 4x.

4x + 3x + 5x + 4x = 48
16x = 48
x = 3

Find the age of the eldest boy:

The eldest boy's age is 5x = 5 * 3 = 15 years.

Therefore, the age of the eldest boy is 15.


13)Question: 5 of 10
A bought an article for $4500 and sold it at a loss of 40%. What was the selling price of the article?

Options:

$2250
$2700
$3150
$3600
Solution:

Calculate the loss amount:

Loss = 40% of $4500 = 0.40 * $4500 = $1800

Calculate the selling price:

Selling price = Cost price - Loss = $4500 - $1800 = $2700

Therefore, the selling price of the article was $2700.


15)Question: 6 of 10

Choose the correct option

What would be the simple interest on a sum of $18000 at 15% per annum for the period between 15th January 2013 to 29th March 2013?

Options:
$360
$540
$432
$688

Ans:
Let's calculate the simple interest:

Find the number of days:

From 15th January to 29th March, there are:

16 days in January
28 days in February (2013 was not a leap year)
29 days in March
Total days = 16 + 28 + 29 = 73 days

Convert days to years:

73 days = 73/365 years ≈ 0.2 years

Calculate the simple interest:

Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
= (18000 * 15 * 0.2) / 100
= 540

Therefore, the simple interest is $540.




16)Question: 7 of 10
A buyer purchases 50 bags of rice at $13 each and 30 bags for $15 each. If they bought a total of 100 bags at an average price of $14.4, what is the cost per bag at which they bought the rest of the rice?

Options:

$15
$16
$17
$18

Ans:
Solution:

Calculate the total cost of the first 80 bags:

Cost of 50 bags at $13 each = 50 * $13 = $650
Cost of 30 bags at $15 each = 30 * $15 = $450
Total cost of 80 bags = $650 + $450 = $1100

Calculate the total cost of all 100 bags:

Total cost of 100 bags = Average price * Total number of bags = $14.4 * 100 = $1440

Calculate the cost of the remaining 20 bags:

Cost of remaining 20 bags = Total cost of 100 bags - Total cost of 80 bags = $1440 - $1100 = $340

Calculate the cost per bag for the remaining 20 bags:

Cost per bag = Total cost of 20 bags / Number of bags = $340 / 20 = $17

Therefore, the cost per bag at which they bought the rest of the rice is $17.



17)Question: 8 of 10

Choose the correct option

At what rate of interest per annum will the simple interest on a sum of $5000 be $360 in 9 months?

Options:
12%
9.6%
8%
14%

Ans:
Let's calculate the interest rate:

Convert 9 months to years:

9 months = 9/12 years = 0.75 years

Use the simple interest formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
360 = (5000 * Rate * 0.75) / 100

Solve for the rate:

Rate = (360 * 100) / (5000 * 0.75) = 9.6

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 9.6%.




18)Question: 9 of 10

A barrel is filled with a 1:5 mixture of water and oil. How much oil must be removed and replaced with water if the ratio is changed to 2:3?

Options:

1/3rd
1/4th
1/5th
1/2nd
Solution:

Let's assume the barrel contains 6 units of liquid (since 1+5 = 6).

Initial state:

Water: 1 unit
Oil: 5 units
Desired state (2:3 ratio):

Water: 2 units
Oil: 3 units
To achieve the desired ratio, we need to remove oil and replace it with water.

Analysis:

Currently, there is 1 unit of water, and we need 2 units. So, we need to add 1 unit of water.
To add 1 unit of water, we need to remove 1 unit of oil.
Fraction of oil to be removed:

1 unit of oil is 1/5th of the total oil (5 units).
Therefore, 1/5th of the oil must be removed and replaced with water.

Choose the correct option

If a man were to sell his TV for $720, he would lose 25%. At what price must he sell his TV to gain a 30% margin?

Options:
$1,260
$1,248
$1,236
$1,224

This is the last question, submit this section & go to next section.

Ans:
Let's solve this step-by-step:

Find the cost price of the TV:

If selling the TV for $720 results in a 25% loss, then $720 is 75% of the cost price.

Let the cost price be CP.

0.75 * CP = 720
CP = 720 / 0.75
CP = $960

Calculate the selling price for a 30% profit:

A 30% profit means the selling price (SP) is 130% of the cost price.

SP = 1.30 * CP
SP = 1.30 * 960
SP = $1,248

Therefore, he must sell the TV for $1,248 to gain a 30% margin.

Choose the correct option

In a certain code language, if CHICAGO is written as FJLEDIR and DENVER as GGQXHT, how will PARIS be written in that language?

Options:
SDULV
SDTLV
SCUKV
SCTLU

Ans:
Let's analyze the code:

CHICAGO -> FJLEDIR

C shifts to F (+3)
H shifts to J (+2)
I shifts to L (+2)
C shifts to F (+3)
A shifts to E (+4)
G shifts to I (+2)
O shifts to R (+3)
DENVER -> GGQXHT

D shifts to G (+3)
E shifts to G (+2)
N shifts to Q (+3)
V shifts to X (+2)
E shifts to H (+3)
R shifts to T (+2)
We can observe a pattern: the letters are shifted by a specific number of positions in the alphabet, and this shift is not fixed but varies.

Applying this pattern to "PARIS":

P shifts to S (+3)
A shifts to C (+2)
R shifts to U (+3)
I shifts to L (+2)
S shifts to V (+3)
So, "PARIS" is coded as "SCULV".
