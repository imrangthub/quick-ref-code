1	Core Java	
=================================================
Java Class, Fields, Methods and Objects
Ans:
    Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
    Fields: Variables declared inside a class to represent the properties of objects.
    Methods: Functions within a class that define the behavior of its objects.
    Objects: Instances of a class, created using the new keyword, representing real-world entities.


Access Modifiers, Constructor, Object creation
    Access Modifiers
        Control the visibility of classes, fields, and methods:
        Public: Accessible from anywhere.
        Private: Accessible only within the same class.
        Protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
            The protected access modifier allows access to members within the same package and 
            by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
            Restrictions: Non-subclass classes outside the package1 cannot directly access protected members.
            Examlple:
                Parent.java class has a protected method: protected void displayMessage();
                Now a chile cllas in differenet package not able to accessa this displayMessage(); createing new object of Parent class
                But able to access with in Child class if Clild class extedn Prant class as:
                // Child class in package2
                    package package2;

                    import package1.Parent;

                    public class Child extends Parent {
                        public void show() {
                            displayMessage(); // Accessible because Child is a subclass of Parent
                        }
                    }
            But not as:
                // Parent parent = new Parent();
                // parent.displayMessage(); // Compilation error: displayMessage() is not accessible directly.
        Default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.
    Constructor
        A special method used to initialize objects.
        It has the same name as the class.
        It has no return type.
        Can be overloaded.


Java Record
Ans:
    A record is a special kind of class introduced in Java 14 (Preview) and finalized in Java 16.
    It is designed to simplify the creation of immutable data objects by automatically generating constructors, 
    getters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods.

    Example a Record:
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Creating a record object
            Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);

            // Accessing fields (no 'get' prefix)
            System.out.println(person.name()); // Output: Alice
            System.out.println(person.age());  // Output: 30

            // Implicitly generated toString
            System.out.println(person); // Output: Person[name=Alice, age=30]
        }
    }

    // Record declaration
    public record Person(String name, int age) {}

    Limitations
        Cannot extend other classes (records are implicitly final).
        Cannot have mutable fields.
        Designed only for data-carrying classes, not behavior-rich objects.


OOP in Java - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance
Ans:
    Abstraction:
        Hides implementation details and shows only the essential features.
        Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
    Polymorphism
        Allows one entity to take many forms (e.g., method overriding and overloading).
        Example (Method Overriding):
    Encapsulation
        Restricts direct access to fields and methods using access modifiers.
        Achieved by using private fields with public getters and setters.

    Inheritance
        Allows a class to inherit fields and methods from a parent class.
        Achieved using the extends keyword.


Java String, StringBuilder, String Buffer, Text Block
String:
    Immutable sequence of characters.
    Operations like concatenation create new objects.
    Example:
    String str = "Hello";
    str = str + " World"; // Creates a new String object

StringBuilder:
    Mutable and faster for single-threaded operations.(Not thread-safe)
    Ideal for frequent string modifications.
    Suitable for single-threaded operations.
Example:
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
    sb.append(" World"); // Modifies the same object

StringBuffer:
    Mutable and thread-safe (synchronized).
    Slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization overhead.
    Suitable for multi-threaded operations.
    Example:
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sb.append(" World");
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable classes for handling strings.

Text Block:
Introduced in Java 15, it simplifies multiline string creation.
Uses triple quotes (""") for better readability.
Example:
java
Copy code
String json = """
              {
                  "name": "Alice",
                  "age": 30
              }
              """;


String Litterals, String creating with new keyworkd:
Ans:
    String Literals:
        Strings created using double quotes ("") are stored in the String Pool.
        If a literal already exists in the pool, the same reference is returned.
        Memory efficient.
    Example:
        String s1 = "Hello"; // Stored in String Pool
        String s2 = "Hello"; // Same reference as s1
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); // Output: true

    String with new Keyword:
        Creates a new String object in heap memory, bypassing the String Pool.
        Even if the content is the same, a new reference is created.
    Example:
        String s1 = new String("Hello"); // New object in the heap
        String s2 = new String("Hello"); // Another new object
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); // Output: false (different references)



String constant pool, String comparison, Trim String:
Ans:
Key Points:
    When a new string literal is created, Java first checks the pool to see if an equivalent string already exists.
    If it exists, the new reference points to the existing object. Otherwise, a new object is created in the pool.
    Strings created using new are stored in the heap, not in the pool.
. String Comparison

There are two ways to compare strings in Java:
    Using ==:
        Compares references, not content.
        Only returns true if both references point to the same object.
    Using .equals():
        Compares the content of the strings.
        Returns true if the actual text of the strings is identical

Trim String:
    It does not modify the original string (strings are immutable in Java).
    Returns a new String without leading or trailing spaces.




String matching, searching, convertion wiht valueOf(), String Concatanation
Ans:
String Matching:
    equals(): Checks content equality (case-sensitive).
    equalsIgnoreCase(): Ignores case during comparison.

String Searching:
    contains(): Checks if a string contains a sequence of characters.
    indexOf(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
    startsWith() / endsWith(): Checks if the string starts/ends with a specific substring.

Conversion with valueOf():
    Converts data types (e.g., integers, floats, objects) into a String.
    Example:
        int num = 42;
        String str = String.valueOf(num); // Converts int to String
        System.out.println(str); // "42"

String Concatenation:
    Neither + nor .concat() modifies the original strings (s1, s2). 
    Instead, they both create new String objects to store the result.

Correct! StringBuilder and StringBuffer do not create a new String object for every modification.

When +:
    Handles implicit type conversions.
    Readability is a priority: The + operator is more intuitive and easier to read.
    Simple concatenations: When you're concatenating a few strings or literals.
    Mixed types: When you need to concatenate non-String types (e.g., numbers, booleans).

Use .concat() (String Method):
    Explicit string operations are needed: Use .concat() when you want to emphasize you're working strictly with String objects.
    Performance is not critical: Though .concat() is slightly faster than +.



Why is the character array preferred over string for storing confidential information?
Ans:
    Sensitive data stored in a String (e.g., passwords) remains in memory until garbage collection clears it, which may not happen immediately.
    This increases the risk of memory exposure (e.g., through memory dumps).

    With a char[], you have full control over how long the data stays in memory and can clear it immediately after use.
    A String's contents are outside your control and might stay in memory longer.
    Memory Dump Risks

    Strings are often stored in the String Pool (if created as literals), making them accessible for a longer duration.
    Memory analysis tools can reveal sensitive information if it’s stored in a String.




Replace character in string, Format String
Ans:
    Using replace()
    Replaces all occurrences of a character or substring with another.
    Using replaceAll()
    Replaces all substrings that match a regular expression.
    Using replaceFirst()
    Replaces the first substring that matches a regular expression.

    Use the String.format() method to format strings with placeholders.
        %s: String
        %d: Integer
        %f: Floating-point number

    Alignment and Padding:
        Left-align: %-n
        Right-align: %n




Pass by Value and Pass by Reference:
Ans:
    Pass by value
        A copy of the variable's value is passed to the function, and the function works on the copy. 
        Changes made to the variable within the function will not affect the original variable.

    Pass by reference
        The memory address of the variable is shared with the function argument. 
        This means that any changes made to the argument within the function will also affect the original variable.

In Java, everything is passed by value.
Java is always pass by value, but for objects, the "value" passed is the reference to the same object. 
This is why it sometimes feels like "pass by reference."

Pass by Value for Primitives:
    For primitive types (int, double, etc.), the value is copied directly.
    Changes to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value.
    Example:
        public class Example {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int x = 10;
                modifyPrimitive(x);
                System.out.println("x after method call: " + x); // Output: 10
            }

            public static void modifyPrimitive(int num) {
                num = 20; // Modifies the local copy, not the original
            }
        }

Pass by Value for Objects:
    For objects, the value of the reference (the memory address) is passed, not the object itself.
    This means the method receives a copy of the reference, pointing to the same object.
    You can modify the object's internal state, but you cannot reassign the original reference in the caller's scope.

Example: Modifying Object State:
        class Person {
            String name;
        }

        public class Example {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Person person = new Person();
                person.name = "Alice";
                modifyObject(person);
                System.out.println("Name after method call: " + person.name); // Output: Bob
            }

            public static void modifyObject(Person p) {
                p.name = "Bob"; // Modifies the object itself
            }
        }
Example: Reassigning Reference:
    public class Example {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Person person = new Person();
            person.name = "Alice";
            reassignReference(person);
            System.out.println("Name after method call: " + person.name); // Output: Alice
        }

        public static void reassignReference(Person p) {
            p = new Person(); // Reassigns the local reference, not the original one
            p.name = "Bob";
        }
    }


Java Date & Time:
Ans:
    LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime (Java 8+)
    For working with date, time, and both.
    Format and parse with DateTimeFormatter.
    Instant for timestamps, Duration for time differences.
    Date and Calendar for older date handling(Legacy Classes)



Java Interfaces and Abstract class, Java Enum, Java Iterator and Iterable
Ans:
    Interface
        An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
        All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract (unless defined as default or static).
        An interface defines a contract that a class must follow if it implements the interface, but it does not provide the method implementations.
        A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for more flexible design (multiple inheritance).

    Abstract Class:
        An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is intended to be subclassed.
        It can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).
        It can have fields, constructors, and method implementations, unlike interfaces.
        A subclass of an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods unless it is also abstract.
        Abstract classes are typically used to represent "shared" functionality for a group of related classes.

    Enum
        An enum in Java is a special class that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
        Enums are more powerful than simple constants because they can have fields, methods, and constructors.
        They are implicitly final and cannot be subclassed.
        Enums are useful when you have a fixed set of related constants, such as days of the week, directions, or status codes.


Java Object class and its mehtod - wait(), notify(), toString(), equals(), hashCode() (Java Object Class and Its Methods)
Ans:
    In Java, every class implicitly inherits from the Object class, which is the root of the class hierarchy. 
    The Object class provides several methods that are fundamental for all Java objects.
    wait() and notify(): Used in multi-threading for inter-thread communication.
    toString(): Helps in providing a string representation of the object.
    equals() and hashCode(): Important for object comparison and hashing in collections. When you override equals(), you must also override hashCode() to maintain consistency.


Object cloning in java, why it is needed ?
Ans:
    Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object, usually with the same values and attributes, 
    but in a different memory location. Java provides the clone() method, which is a part of the Object class.
When you need to duplicate objects but retain their independent state.
In situations where object immutability is required for safety, but cloning allows temporary modifications without altering the original object.

Shallow vs. Deep Cloning
    Shallow cloning: Only the references to objects are copied, so changes to the nested objects 
    in the clone will affect the original object.
    Deep cloning: Involves recursive cloning of nested objects, ensuring that the clone is fully independent of the original object.

Cloneable Interface
    Implementing the Cloneable interface is not enough for deep cloning. You often need to manually override clone() to 
    handle deep cloning if required.

Exceptions
    Cloning can lead to CloneNotSupportedException if the class does not implement Cloneable. 
    The clone() method must also handle exceptions appropriately.

Object Cloning and Performance
    Cloning is a relatively expensive operation. In some cases, creating a new object manually might be more efficient 
    than cloning, especially for complex objects with deep structures.



Java Collection Framework - List, Set, Map, ArrayList, HashMap, Hashtable, HashSet, LinkedList and different operations on collection

Java Collection Framework:
    The Java Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to handle groups of objects. 
    It is part of the java.util package and includes 
    three main types  interfaces, with concrete classes to handle groups of objects: List, Set, and Map.

        1. List
        What: Ordered, allows duplicates.
        Example: ArrayList, LinkedList.
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("A");
        list.add("B");

        2. Set
        What: Unordered, no duplicates.
        Example: HashSet.
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add("A");
        set.add("B");

        3. Map
        What: Key-value pairs, unique keys.
        Example: HashMap.
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("A", 1);
        map.put("B", 2);




How does the size of ArrayList grow dynamically? And also state how it is implemented internally.
Internal Implementation of ArrayList
    Backing Array:
        Internally, an ArrayList uses an array to store its elements.
        The array is initialized with a default size (10 elements) when the ArrayList is created.

    Growth Mechanism:
        When an element is added and the current capacity is full, a new array is created with twice the size of the original array.
        This means if the initial size is 10, it will grow to 20, 40, 80, etc.

    Array Resize Process:
        Step 1: Create a new array with double the size.
        Step 2: Copy all elements from the old array to the new array.
        Step 3: Update the reference to point to the new array.

    Efficiency Considerations:
        This dynamic resizing ensures that the ArrayList can grow without worrying about its size upfront.
        Although resizing can be an expensive operation (since it involves copying elements), 
        it happens infrequently because the growth is exponential (doubling each time).


How HashMap works internally and how to minimize hash collision
Ans:
Summary of How HashMap Works:
    Uses an array of buckets to store key-value pairs.
    Keys are hashed to determine the bucket index.
    Handles collisions with a linked list or red-black tree.
    Operations like put(), get(), and remove() rely on efficient bucket indexing and hashing.

Ways to Minimize Collisions:
    Use a good hashCode() implementation.
    Ensure proper equals() method implementation.
    Adjust the load factor and initial capacity to reduce frequent resizing.



Sorting Java Collections, Comparing Java Custom Object, Comparable and Comperator
Sorting a List
    Using Collections.sort():
    Sorts a list based on the natural ordering of its elements or a custom comparator.
    The list must implement the Comparable interface, or you can use a custom Comparator.
Using List.sort():
    Available from Java 8, this method is equivalent to Collections.sort() but is called directly on the list.
Sorting a Set
    TreeSet: Automatically sorts elements upon insertion using the natural ordering or a comparator.

Comparing Java Custom Objects:
    To sort custom objects, you need to define how two objects are compared. 
    You can achieve this through Comparable or Comparator interfaces.

1) Comparable Interface:
    What: Used when you want the class to have a natural order.
    How: Implement the compareTo(T o) method in your class, which compares the current object (this) with the provided object (o).
    Purpose: Define the default sorting behavior of the object.

    class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
        String name;
        int age;
        
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
        
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Person other) {
            return this.age - other.age;  // Sort by age in ascending order
        }
    }

    List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
    people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
    people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
    Collections.sort(people);  // Sorts by age (natural order)

The compareTo() method returns:
    Negative if this is less than other.
    Zero if they are equal.
    Positive if this is greater than other.

2. Comparator Interface
    What: Used when you want to define multiple sorting orders or external comparison logic.
    How: Implement the compare(T o1, T o2) method in the comparator.
    Purpose: Allows sorting based on different fields or criteria without modifying the object itself.
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;
        
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    class NameComparator implements Comparator<Person> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
            return p1.name.compareTo(p2.name);  // Sort by name alphabetically
        }
    }

    List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
    people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
    people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
    people.sort(new NameComparator());  // Sorts by name

Custom sorting using Comparator:
Comparator can also be used with Collections.sort() or List.sort().





Lamda Expression, Stream API, Functional Interface, Functional Programming
Lambda Expression:
    Introduced in Java 8, allows writing anonymous functions (compact code for functional-style programming).
    Syntax: (parameters) -> {expression/body}.
    Simplifies code, especially for functional interfaces.
    Example:
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
    numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));  // Print each number

Stream API:
    Introduced in Java 8, processes collections in a functional style.
    Provides operations like filter(), map(), reduce(), sorted().
    Supports lazy evaluation and promotes clean, declarative code.
    Example:
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
    List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

Functional Interface:
    An interface with one abstract method (e.g., Runnable, Callable).
    Annotated with @FunctionalInterface for clarity.
    Enables use of lambda expressions.
    Example:
    @FunctionalInterface
    interface Calculator {
        int calculate(int x, int y);
    }
    Calculator add = (a, b) -> a + b;  // Lambda implementing the interface

Functional Programming:
    A paradigm where computations are treated as evaluations of functions.
    Focuses on immutability, pure functions, and statelessness.
    Promoted in Java via lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.
    Benefits:
        Cleaner, concise code.
        Facilitates parallelism with streams.
        Reduces side effects and enhances maintainability.


Stream API - terminal operations, non terminal operations, Pure Function, Higher Order Funciton, 
Function Composition, different built-in functional interface, different types of aggregation, build your own collector.
Ans:
Stream API
    Non-Terminal Operations (Intermediate):
        Return a Stream for further processing.
        Lazy evaluated (executed only when a terminal operation is applied).
        Examples: filter(), map(), flatMap(), sorted(), distinct().

    Terminal Operations:
        Trigger stream execution, producing a result (e.g., value, collection, side-effect).
        Examples: collect(), reduce(), forEach(), count(), findFirst().

Pure Function:
    A function where the output depends only on its input and has no side effects (e.g., doesn't modify external state).
    Ensures immutability and referential transparency.
    Example: n -> n * 2 is pure since it depends solely on n.

Higher-Order Function
    A function that either:
    Takes another function as input (e.g., map() accepts a lambda).
    Returns a function as output.
    Example:
    Function<Integer, Function<Integer, Integer>> add = x -> y -> x + y;

Function Composition:
    Combines multiple functions into a single function.
    In Java, achieved using methods like andThen() and compose() in Function.
    Example:
    Function<Integer, Integer> doubleIt = x -> x * 2;
    Function<Integer, Integer> addTen = x -> x + 10;
    Function<Integer, Integer> composed = doubleIt.andThen(addTen);  // (x * 2) + 10

Built-in Functional Interfaces:
    Predicate: boolean test(T t) for conditions (filter() uses it).
    Example: Predicate<Integer> isEven = n -> n % 2 == 0;.
    Function: R apply(T t) for transformations (map() uses it).
    Consumer: void accept(T t) for side effects (forEach() uses it).
    Supplier: T get() for supplying values.
    BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator, etc., for specific use cases.

Aggregation in Streams:
    Summing: sum(), Collectors.summingInt().
    Averaging: Collectors.averagingInt().
    Counting: count().
    Reducing: reduce().
    Example:
    int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);  // Sum all nu


Create custom functional interface and use it with Stream API
Ans:
    Creating a Custom Functional Interface:
        Define a functional interface with a single abstract method.
        Annotate it with @FunctionalInterface for clarity.

Custom Functional Interface Simplified Example
Here’s a streamlined example of a custom functional interface and its use in the Stream API:

@FunctionalInterface
interface Transformer<T, R> {
    R transform(T input);  // Single abstract method
}

public class CustomInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // List of numbers
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Custom interface implementation using lambda
        Transformer<Integer, String> toStringTransformer = n -> "Number: " + n;

        // Use Stream API with the custom interface
        List<String> transformedList = numbers.stream()
                                              .map(toStringTransformer::transform) // Use custom method
                                              .toList();

        // Print the result
        transformedList.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

Explanation:
    Define the Custom Interface:
        Transformer<T, R> transforms an input of type T into a result of type R.
    Lambda Implementation:
        toStringTransformer converts an integer into a formatted string.
    Stream API Integration:
        map(toStringTransformer::transform) applies the custom transformation on each element.
Output
    Copy code
    Number: 1
    Number: 2
    Number: 3
    Number: 4
    Number: 5
    This example is simple yet demonstrates the power of custom functional interfaces with Stream API.

        pstmt.executeUpdate();

JDBC Batching:
    Batch processing sends multiple queries in a single database call, reducing round-trips and improving performance.
    Supported by Statement and PreparedStatement.
    Example:
        PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)");
        pstmt.setString(1, "Alice");
        pstmt.setInt(2, 30);
        pstmt.addBatch();

        pstmt.setString(1, "Bob");
        pstmt.setInt(2, 25);
        pstmt.addBatch();

        pstmt.executeBatch()
Connection Pooling: Optimizes connection management for high-performance applications.

Concurrency vs Parallelism
    Concurrency: Handling many tasks at once (may be interleaved).
                Managing multiple tasks by quickly switching between them (e.g., multi-threading).
    Parallelism: Performing many tasks at the same time (simultaneous execution).
                A multi-core CPU running separate tasks simultaneously on different cores.



Java Multi Threading, Creating threads in different ways
    Thread Class: Simple but less flexible, suitable for single-threaded tasks.
    Runnable Interface: Preferred when you need to extend another class or want to share the same task among multiple threads.
    Lambda Expressions: Makes code more concise.
    ExecutorService: Best for managing multiple threads efficiently with a thread pool.


Runnable vs Thread, Thread Lifecycle, Thread Signaling, Thread Join, Volatile keyword, Thread Local, Java Virtual Thread
    Thread Lifecycle
    New: Thread created but not started.
    Runnable: Ready to run, waiting for CPU.
    Running: Actively executing.
    Blocked/Waiting: Paused, waiting for resources/signals.
    Terminated: Execution completed.


Java Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
    Lightweight threads introduced in Java 19.
    Managed by the JVM for high scalability.
    Simplifies concurrency with better resource efficiency.



Race Condition, Deadlock, Deadlock Prevention
Ans:
Race Condition:
    Definition: Occurs when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously, 
    and the outcome depends on the execution order.
    Example: Two threads incrementing the same variable without proper synchronization may lead to incorrect results.
    Solution: Use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., synchronized, Locks) to prevent concurrent access.

Deadlock:
    Definition: Happens when two or more threads are waiting for each other’s resources, resulting in an infinite wait state.
    Example:
    Thread A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2.
    Thread B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1.

Deadlock Prevention:
    Resource Ordering:
    Acquire resources in a consistent order across threads.

    Avoid Nested Locks:
    Minimize situations where locks are acquired within other locks.

    Try-Lock Mechanism:
    Use methods like tryLock() with a timeout to avoid indefinite blocking.

    Release Locks Properly:
    Always release locks in finally blocks to ensure they are freed, even during exceptions.

    Avoid Circular Wait:
    Ensure no thread holds one resource while waiting for another held by another thread.



Locks in Java, Thread Safety, Critical Section, Synchronization
Ans:
Locks in Java
    Definition: Explicit control mechanisms for thread synchronization.
    Types:
    ReentrantLock: A flexible, explicit lock allowing reentrant access.
    ReadWriteLock: Optimizes read operations by allowing multiple readers but single writer.
    StampedLock: Supports optimistic locking for better performance in read-heavy scenarios.

Thread Safety:
    Definition: Ensures consistent behavior of shared resources across threads.
    How to Achieve:
    Synchronization (e.g., synchronized block/method).
    Locks for finer-grained control.
    Atomic classes (e.g., AtomicInteger).

Critical Section:
    Definition: A part of the code that accesses shared resources.
    Risk: Concurrent modification by threads without proper synchronization may lead to race conditions.
    Solution: Protect critical sections using synchronized or locks.

Synchronization:
    Definition: Mechanism to control thread access to shared resources.
    Types:
    Synchronized Method: Locks the whole method on the object or class.
    Synchronized Block: Locks a specific section of code or resource.
    Example:
    java
    Copy code
    synchronized (lock) {
        // critical section
    }
    Drawback: Can lead to performance overhead if overused.






Reentrant Locks, Mutex, Semaphore, and Monitor

Reentrant Locks:
    Definition: A lock allowing the same thread to acquire it multiple times without causing a deadlock.
    Key Features:
    Explicit locking/unlocking (lock()/unlock()).
    Provides advanced features like tryLock() with timeout and interruptible locks.
Example:
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    // critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}


Mutex:
    Definition: A synchronization primitive ensuring only one thread accesses a resource at a time.
    Java Implementation: Achieved using synchronized or ReentrantLock.

Semaphore:
    Definition: A counter-based synchronization tool controlling access to a limited number of permits.
    Use Case: Limit simultaneous access to resources like a connection pool.
    Types:
    Binary Semaphore (acts like a mutex).
    Counting Semaphore (allows multiple permits).
    Example:
        Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // 3 permits
        semaphore.acquire();
        try {
            // critical section
        } finally {
            semaphore.release();
        }


Monitor:
    Definition: A concurrency construct that combines mutual exclusion and thread signaling.
    Java Implementation:
    Implicit monitors via synchronized.
    Provides wait/notify mechanisms.
Example:
    synchronized (lock) {
        lock.wait();  // Wait for signal
        lock.notify();  // Notify waiting threads
    }




Executor Framework, Thread Pool, and Blocking Queues

Thread Pool
    Definition: A pool of reusable threads to handle tasks efficiently.
    Advantages:
    Reduces overhead of thread creation.
    Manages a fixed number of threads to optimize resource usage.
    Types:
    Fixed thread pool (Executors.newFixedThreadPool()): Fixed number of threads.
    Cached thread pool (Executors.newCachedThreadPool()): Dynamically growing thread pool.
    Single thread executor (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()): Executes tasks sequentially.
Blocking Queues
    Definition: Thread-safe queues used for inter-thread communication.
    Purpose: Blocks threads during enqueue or dequeue when the queue is full or empty.
    Common Implementations:
    ArrayBlockingQueue: Fixed size, FIFO order.
    LinkedBlockingQueue: Dynamically growing size.
    PriorityBlockingQueue: Orders elements based on priority.



Fork/Join Framework, How Java parallel stream use this fromework ?
Ans:
Fork/Join Framework
Purpose: Breaks a large task into smaller subtasks (fork), processes them in parallel, and combines the results (join).

Key Classes:
    ForkJoinPool: Manages worker threads.
    RecursiveTask: For tasks that return results.
    RecursiveAction: For tasks that don't return results.
    Example Use: Divide-and-conquer algorithms like mergesort or recursive sum.
    How Java Parallel Stream Uses Fork/Join Framework
    Implementation: Parallel streams internally use a common ForkJoinPool to execute stream operations in parallel.

Process:
    Splits the data source into chunks.
    Executes tasks in parallel across available threads in the ForkJoinPool.
    Merges the results at the end.
    Advantages: Simplifies parallel processing with minimal code.

Example:
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum); // Uses Fork/Join internally



Thread safe collections, copy on write collections, and how it works
Ans:
Thread-Safe Collections
    Definition: Collections designed for safe concurrent access by multiple threads.
    Examples:
    Vector: Synchronized alternative to ArrayList.
    Hashtable: Synchronized alternative to HashMap.
    Concurrent Collections:
    ConcurrentHashMap: Efficient thread-safe HashMap alternative using fine-grained locks.
    CopyOnWriteArrayList: Thread-safe alternative to ArrayList for read-heavy operations.

Copy-On-Write Collections
    Definition: Collections that create a new copy of the data structure on modification (e.g., add/remove).

    Examples:

    CopyOnWriteArrayList
    CopyOnWriteArraySet
    How It Works:

    Read Operations: Directly access the immutable snapshot of the collection.
    Write Operations: Create a new copy, modify it, and replace the old reference.
    Ideal for scenarios where reads greatly outnumber writes.


IO Bound vs CPU Bound applicaiton
Ans:
I/O-Bound Application
    Definition: Performance is limited by input/output operations (e.g., reading/writing files, network calls).
    Key Focus: Optimize waiting time (use asynchronous/non-blocking I/O).
    Examples: Web servers, database queries.
CPU-Bound Application
    Definition: Performance is limited by CPU computations (e.g., mathematical calculations, data processing).
    Key Focus: Optimize processing efficiency (use multi-core processors, parallel algorithms).



Java Happens Before Guarantee
Thread Starvation and Fairness
Java CompletableFuture
    appens-Before Guarantee	Ensures visibility and ordering between threads.
    Thread Starvation	When threads are denied CPU time due to higher priority tasks, causing delays.
    Fairness	Ensures equal resource allocation to all threads, preventing starvation.
    CompletableFuture	Allows non-blocking asynchronous execution and chaining of tasks.


Understanding different types of GC - Serial, Parallel, Mark and Sweep, G1, Epsilon. What is stop the word in java

Types of Garbage Collection (GC) in Java
Serial GC:
Uses a single thread for garbage collection.
Best for single-threaded applications.
Stop-the-world: The application is paused during GC.

Parallel GC:
Uses multiple threads for garbage collection.
Suitable for multi-threaded environments.
Stop-the-world: Application pauses during GC, but multiple threads are used to reduce pause time.

Mark and Sweep GC:
Mark Phase: Identifies live objects.
Sweep Phase: Removes unused objects.
Can lead to fragmentation if not followed by compaction.

G1 (Garbage-First) GC:
Designed for large heaps and low-latency applications.
Divides the heap into regions and prioritizes GC work to minimize pause times.
Stop-the-world: Occurs but is optimized for shorter durations.

Epsilon GC:
A no-op garbage collector that does not reclaim memory.
Primarily used for benchmarking or applications where GC is handled manually.

Stop-the-World
    Definition: A phase during garbage collection where all application threads are paused to allow the garbage collector to perform its task.
    Cause: During GC operations like marking, sweeping, or compacting, the JVM halts all application threads temporarily.
    Impact: Can cause latency spikes, especially in high-performance or real-time applications.



Java Generics, Type Erasure, Generic Method and Class, Wildcard Type, Upper Bounded Wildcard, Lower Bounded Wildcard, Bounded Type

Java Generics
    Definition: Allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters, 
    enabling type safety while maintaining flexibility.
    Benefits:
        Provides compile-time type checking.
        Eliminates the need for casting when retrieving elements from collections.

Type Erasure
    Definition: The process by which the generic type information is removed at runtime. After type erasure, the generic type is replaced with its raw type, and type parameters are replaced with bounds (if any).
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    // After type erasure: List becomes List<Object> at runtime

Generic Method and Class:
Generic Method:
    A method that can operate on any type.
    Syntax: <T> returnType methodName(T parameter) { ... }
    Example:
    public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T element : array) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }

Generic Class:
    A class with a type parameter.
    Syntax: class ClassName<T> { ... }
    Example:
        class Box<T> {
            private T value;
            public T getValue() {
                return value;
            }
            public void setValue(T value) {
                this.value = value;
            }
        }

Wildcard Type:
    Definition: A placeholder for an unknown type, used in method arguments to increase flexibility.
    Syntax: <?> (Unknown type)
    Example:
    public void printList(List<?> list) { ... }


Bounded Type:
Definition: Specifies the upper or lower bound of a generic type to restrict the types that can be used.

Upper Bounded Wildcard:
    Definition: Restricts the wildcard to types that are subtypes of a specific class or interface.
    Syntax: <? extends T>
    Example:
    public void printNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) { ... }

Lower Bounded Wildcard:
    Definition: Restricts the wildcard to types that are supertypes of a specific class.
    Syntax: <? super T>
    Example:
    public void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) { ... }





Java Exception and Error Handling
Ans:
    Exceptions represent conditions that can be handled programmatically.
    Errors represent serious issues that generally cannot be handled.
    Use try-catch-finally blocks to handle exceptions and clean up resources.
    Use throw to throw an exception and throws to declare potential exceptions in a method.
    Handle exceptions gracefully and avoid over-catching them.

Java Metadata programming - Annotation Processing, and Java Reflection API 
Annotations are used to add metadata to classes, methods, or fields in your code.
Annotation Processors are tools that can read annotations and generate additional code or resources during the compilation process.

Types of Annotations:
    Built-in Annotations: Examples include @Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings.
    Custom Annotations: You can define your own annotations to add metadata specific to your project.
    @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
        String value() default "defaultValue";
    }
Annotation Processing:
You can create a custom annotation processor that extends AbstractProcessor and override the process() method.
How to run: Annotation processors are invoked automatically during compilation by the Java compiler

Java Reflection API
    Definition: The Java Reflection API allows you to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and other 
    elements of the Java program at runtime, even if they are private or not directly accessible.
    Core Concepts:
        Class: Represents the class or interface at runtime.
        Method: Represents methods of the class.
        Field: Represents fields (variables) of the class.
        Constructor: Represents constructors of the class.

Reflection Operations:
Field Manipulation: Access and modify field values dynamically.
Method Invocation: Call methods of a class without knowing them at compile-time.
Annotations: Retrieve and process annotations at runtime.

Annotation Processing:
    Allows you to process annotations at compile-time to generate code or perform validations.
    It is commonly used for generating boilerplate code, dependency injection, and validation.
Reflection API:
    Provides runtime capabilities to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and other class members.
    Commonly used in frameworks, dynamic proxies, and testing.
    Can have performance overhead and should be used carefully, especially in production environments.





Java Logging 
Java provides a logging API to help developers log messages for monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting applications. 
The Java Logging API is part of the java.util.logging package

Logging with External Libraries:
    While Java's built-in logging is suitable for many applications, many developers prefer more feature-rich 
    logging libraries, such as:
        Log4j: Apache's logging framework, which offers additional features like advanced configuration, log levels, and appenders.
        SLF4J: Simple Logging Facade for Java, which provides a common interface to different logging l
        ibraries (e.g., Log4j, java.util.logging).




Java Cryptography:
    Java provides a robust set of cryptographic tools through its Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and 
    Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to implement encryption, decryption, secure communication, and data integrity checks. 
    By using cryptographic classes like Cipher, MessageDigest, Signature, and KeyPairGenerator, 
    you can secure sensitive information effectively. Proper use of key management, secure random number generation, 
    and algorithm selection is essential for building secure Java applications.


Java Performance - JMH 
JMH is the go-to tool for accurate and reliable microbenchmarking in Java. It is designed to eliminate JVM optimizations 
and background factors that could otherwise skew performance results. By using JMH, developers can benchmark and 
optimize specific parts of their code with confidence.


Java Internationalization 

    Java Internationalization (i18n)
    Java Internationalization refers to designing applications that can adapt to various languages, regions, and cultural conventions.

    Key Concepts:
    Locale: Represents a specific geographical, cultural, or political region. It includes language, country, and variant.
    Locale locale = new Locale("en", "US");

    Why i18n?

    Expands software usability across different regions.
    Reduces costs by avoiding redesigns for multiple markets.


Java IO vs NIO
Java IO (Input/Output):
    Stream-based: Reads/writes data as bytes (InputStream/OutputStream) or characters (Reader/Writer).
    Blocking: IO operations block the thread until completion.
    Simpler API: Easy to use but less efficient for high-performance tasks.


Java NIO (New IO):
    Buffer-based: Data is read into buffers for non-blocking operations.
    Non-blocking: Threads can continue executing while IO operations are performed in the background.
    Selectors: Enables monitoring of multiple channels (e.g., sockets).
    Scalable: Suitable for high-performance applications like servers.

Use IO for simple, single-threaded applications.
Use NIO for high-performance, multi-threaded applications.






2	Framework & Web	
What is spring bean ?
Ans:
A Spring Bean is an object managed by the Spring IoC container, created, configured, and wired as part of the application's runtime.
Managed by the Spring container, with lifecycle and dependency injection handled automatically.


What is spring IoC ? What is it responsible for ?
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) is a design principle where the Spring container manages object creation, configuration, and dependency injection.
Responsibilities:
    Creating and managing beans.
    Injecting dependencies automatically.
    Managing bean lifecycle.



What are the bean scopes available in spring
Spring bean scopes:
    Singleton (default): One instance per Spring container.
    Prototype: A new instance for each request.
    Request: One instance per HTTP request (web apps).
    Session: One instance per HTTP session (web apps).
    Application: One instance per ServletContext (web apps).
    WebSocket: One instance per WebSocket session.


Dependency Injection in Spring? How many ways one can inject objects ?
Ans:
Dependency Injection in Spring allows the container to provide required objects to a class.
Ways to inject objects:
    Constructor Injection: Passing dependencies via the constructor.
    Setter Injection: Using setter methods to set dependencies.
    Field Injection: Directly injecting into fields using @Autowired (not recommended for testing).


Default Injection Way: Spring does not enforce a default; constructor injection is recommended for required dependencies.
@Autowired
private SimpleService simpleService; (This is field injection)

What is ue when?
Field Injection:
Issue: Harder to test because dependencies can't be set manually without reflection.
Use Case: Simple cases or legacy code (not recommended).

Setter Injection:
Issue: Allows changing dependencies after object creation, which can lead to inconsistent state.
Use Case: Optional dependencies.

Constructor Injection (Preferred):
Issue: Slightly more verbose, but no major downsides.
Use Case: Required dependencies. Ensures immutability and easy testing.





Differnet ways of creating spring bean?
XML Configuration:
Define beans in an XML configuration file.

<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>
Annotation-Based Configuration:
Use @Component and related annotations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller) to mark classes as beans.
@Component
public class MyBean {
}

Java-based Configuration:
Use @Configuration and @Bean annotations in a configuration class.
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}

Component Scanning:
Enable component scanning to automatically detect beans in the package.
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}

Factory Method:
Use a static factory method to create a bean.
@Bean
public MyBean myBean() {
    return MyBean.createInstance();
}


Circular Dependency - How to solve this ?
Ans:
Circular Dependency occurs when two or more beans depend on each other, causing an infinite loop of dependencies. This can happen in Spring if Bean A depends on Bean B, and Bean B depends on Bean A.
Solutions:
    Setter Injection:
    Use setter injection to break the circular dependency.

    Use @Lazy Annotation:
    Use @Lazy to delay the initialization of one of the beans, allowing Spring to break the circular dependency.


Different stereotypes in spring and purpose of the stereotypes
Stereotypes in Spring refer to annotations that are used to define different types of beans with specific roles in the application. These annotations help Spring automatically detect and manage beans based on their responsibilities, making the code more readable and maintainable.
Key Stereotype Annotations:
    @Component: Marks a generic bean, usually for utility or general-purpose components.
    @Service: A specialized @Component for service layer beans, typically holding business logic.
    @Repository: A specialized @Component for DAO (Data Access Object) classes, often used for database interaction.
    @Controller: A specialized @Component for Spring MVC controllers that handle HTTP requests.
    @RestController: A combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, used for REST APIs where the response is typically in JSON or XML format.

Injecting Prototype Beans into a Singleton Instance in Spring
Injecting a prototype bean into a singleton bean in Spring can be tricky due to the way Spring manages bean lifecycles. A singleton bean is created once and shared across the application, while a prototype bean is created each time it is requested.

Problem:
If you inject a prototype bean directly into a singleton, the singleton bean will hold a reference to a single instance of the prototype bean, which violates the intended lifecycle (the prototype bean should be created fresh each time).

Solutions:
Using @Lookup Annotation:

Using ApplicationContext:
You can explicitly request a new instance of the prototype bean from the ApplicationContext inside the singleton.

Using ObjectFactory or Provider:



DI Exceptions - UnsatisfiedDependencyException, Circular Dependency Exception, NoSuchBeanDefinitionException
    UnsatisfiedDependencyException:
    Cause: This exception occurs when Spring cannot satisfy a bean's dependency during injection. 
    It typically happens if the required bean is not found or not correctly configured.

    CircularDependencyException:
    Cause: This happens when two or more beans depend on each other, leading to a circular reference.

    NoSuchBeanDefinitionException:
    Cause: This exception occurs when Spring cannot find a bean definition for a requested type or name.


Injecting Collections, Generic Objects
Spring can inject lists, sets, maps, and arrays into beans using @Autowired.
You can inject generic beans using @Qualifier if you have multiple beans of the same generic type.
You can also inject a collection of generic objects into a single bean.


Use of @Primary, @Qualifier, @Order, @Lazy, and @Lookup
    @Primary: Use it when you want one bean to be the default choice when there are multiple beans of the same type.
    @Qualifier: Use it to specify exactly which bean to inject when there are multiple candidates of the same type.
    @Order: Use it to define the order in which beans are processed or injected.
    @Lazy: Use it to delay the initialization of a bean until it is actually needed.
    @Lookup: Use it to inject a new instance of a prototype bean into a singleton bean.


Spring Cloud, Service Discovery, and Gateway
Spring Cloud provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and managing microservices.
Service Discovery enables automatic service registration and discovery via tools like Eureka, so services don’t need static configurations.
Spring Cloud Gateway acts as a reverse proxy or API Gateway, providing routing, load balancing, and filtering, and integrates seamlessly with service discovery to route traffic to available services.


What is Servlet ? Life cycle of Servlet. What is Dispetcher Servlets, Servlet Filters and Listener ?
    Servlet: A Java class that processes HTTP requests and responses. It has a lifecycle consisting of init(), service(), and destroy() methods.
    DispatcherServlet: In Spring, it acts as the front controller, handling incoming requests and routing them to appropriate controllers.
    Servlet Filters: Used to process requests and responses (e.g., logging, authentication) before or after they reach a servlet.
    Servlet Listeners: Listen for specific events in the servlet container, such as context or session creation/destruction, to perform necessary actions.


Spring Security: What is security filter chain ?
The Security Filter Chain in Spring Security is a set of filters that are applied to incoming HTTP requests to perform security-related tasks such as authentication, authorization, and logging. 

Default Filters:
    Some common filters included in the default Spring Security filter chain are:
    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter: Handles login requests with a username and password.
    BasicAuthenticationFilter: Processes HTTP Basic authentication.
    CSRFFilter: Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
    ExceptionTranslationFilter: Handles security exceptions and redirects or returns appropriate responses.
    SecurityContextPersistenceFilter: Handles storing and retrieving security context information (e.g., the current authenticated user).
    FilterSecurityInterceptor: The last filter in the chain, responsible for checking if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a resource.


Spring Security: Session Based Authentication, Token Based Authentication
Both Session-Based Authentication and Token-Based Authentication are common methods for securing web applications, 
but they differ in how user authentication and session management are handled.

Session Based Authentication,
--------------------------------
Session-Based Authentication is simple and stateful, where the server keeps track of the user's session, making it suitable for traditional web applications.

Disadvantages:
Scalability: Storing session data on the server can become a bottleneck, especially in distributed environments. You may need session replication or sticky sessions in load-balanced environments.
Stateful: The server needs to maintain state, which can be resource-intensive, especially for a large number of users.

Token-Based Authentication
--------------------------------
Token-Based Authentication is stateless, making it ideal for distributed systems, APIs, and microservices, 
offering greater scalability and flexibility, especially in environments like SPAs and mobile apps.
Token interception (must use HTTPS)



Spring Security: Role-Permission Management
1. Basic Concepts:
    Roles: A role is a high-level concept representing a user's responsibility or job. Typically, roles are associated with permissions, allowing users to access resources.
    Example: ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN.
    Permissions: A permission represents the actual rights a user has to access certain resources or perform specific actions.
    Example: READ_PRIVILEGE, WRITE_PRIVILEGE.

You can use annotations like @PreAuthorize or @Secured to protect methods based on roles or permissions.
@PreAuthorize is more flexible and allows you to use SpEL (Spring Expression Language) for more complex authorization rules.
@Secured is simpler and restricts method access to users with the specified role.

Roles are broad categories that group permissions.
Permissions are granular rights that control access to specific resources.
Spring Security provides different ways to manage both roles and permissions, including annotations (@Secured, @PreAuthorize), HTTP security configuration, and database-driven authorization.
RBAC focuses on user roles, while PBAC (Permission-Based Access Control) offers fine-grained access control.



Spring @Transactional with Different types of Transaction Propagation
In Spring, the @Transactional annotation is used to manage transactions in a declarative way. It ensures that methods are executed within a transaction context, and the transaction can be rolled back or committed based on certain conditions.

Transaction Propagation Types:
Spring provides different propagation types that define how transactions are handled when multiple transactions are involved. The propagation attribute of the @Transactional annotation specifies how the current transaction should behave with respect to an existing transaction.

1. REQUIRED (Default Propagation)
Behavior: If there is an existing transaction, the method will join the existing transaction. If there is no transaction, a new one will be created.
Use Case: This is the default behavior and is used for most transactional methods.
Example:

@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
public void someMethod() {
    // Method logic
}

2. REQUIRES_NEW
Behavior: A new transaction is always created, and if there is an existing transaction, it is suspended until the new transaction completes.
Use Case: Used when you want to ensure that the method runs in its own independent transaction, regardless of the existing transaction.
Example:

@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void someMethod() {
    // Method logic in a new transaction
}

3. SUPPORTS
Behavior: If there is an existing transaction, the method will join it. If there is no transaction, the method will execute without a transaction.
Use Case: Used for operations that are not critical but should participate in a transaction if one exists.

4. MANDATORY
Behavior: If there is an existing transaction, the method will join it. If there is no existing transaction, an exception (TransactionRequiredException) is thrown.
Use Case: Used when the method must always run inside an existing transaction.

How to enable actuator endpoints
1. Add Spring Boot Actuator Dependency
Add the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency to your pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle).

2. Configure Actuator Endpoints in application.properties or application.yml
By default, some actuator endpoints are enabled, but you can customize which ones are enabled or exposed using the configuration file.
By adding the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency and configuring the application.properties or application.yml, you can enable and customize the actuator endpoints in your Spring Boot application.



Use of @ConfigurationProperties, Usages of Environment Variables in Spring Boot’s Properties Files
1. @ConfigurationProperties in Spring Boot
@ConfigurationProperties is a Spring annotation used to bind external configuration properties (e.g., from application.properties or application.yml) to a Java bean. This approach provides a strongly-typed way to handle configuration properties instead of using @Value for individual properties.

Spring Boot Environment Variable Resolution
Precedence Order: The order of precedence is:
Command-line arguments (highest priority)
Environment variables
Java system properties
application.properties / application.yml (lowest priority)



AOP - Point Cut, Advice, Joint Point
Pointcut: Specifies where (which methods) the advice will be applied.
Advice: Defines the action to take at the join points (e.g., log, validate, modify behavior).
Join Point: A specific point in program execution (usually a method execution) where advice can be applied.


Unit Testion - JUnit Jupiter
JUnit Jupiter is the new programming model and extension model for JUnit 5, which provides a modern and flexible way to write and run tests.
Key Features:
Annotations:
@Test: Marks a method as a test case.
@BeforeEach: Runs before each test method.
@AfterEach: Runs after each test method.
@BeforeAll: Runs once before all tests in the class.
@AfterAll: Runs once after all tests in the class.
@ParameterizedTest: Used for running the same test with different inputs.
Assertions:

assertEquals(), assertTrue(), assertFalse(), assertNull(), etc.
Assertions Library:

Includes fluent assertions like assertThat(), assertThrows() for exception testing.
Test Lifecycle:

Supports test lifecycle hooks for initialization and cleanup using @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, etc.
JUnit Jupiter is the foundation of JUnit 5 and is designed to be more extensible and flexible compared to older versions.

JSP, Thymeleaf, Javascript, Ajax
    JSP: Java-based view technology for dynamic web pages (outdated compared to newer technologies).
    Thymeleaf: A more modern templating engine, often used with Spring Boot.
    JavaScript: Client-side scripting language for interactive functionality.
    AJAX: Technique for making asynchronous requests to update page content without a full reload.
