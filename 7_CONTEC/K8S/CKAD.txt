Topics Covered on the Exam
-------------------------------------------------


Cluster Architecture, Installation, and Configuration (25%)
A big part of the exam will focus on the Kubernetes setup and configuration. The tutorial, ‚ÄúKubernetes The Hard Way‚Äù is a very helpful tool as you prepare for this section. I‚Äôll talk more about this tutorial later.

Workloads and Scheduling (15%)
You‚Äôll be expected to create robust deployments..

Storage (10%)
A small section will test your knowledge about volumes and volume claims.

Troubleshooting (30%)
The biggest section of the exam will test you on troubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster. This is a task you can only improve at through practice.



Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
-------------------------------------------------
The CKA tests your ability to deploy and configure a Kubernetes cluster as well as your understanding of core concepts. Candidates have three hours to take the exam and must score 74% or higher to earn the certification.

The CKA exam tests the following areas:

8% ‚Äì Application lifecycle management
12% ‚Äì Installation, configuration & validation
19% ‚Äì Core concepts
11% ‚Äì Networking
5% ‚Äì Scheduling
12% ‚Äì Security
11% ‚Äì Cluster maintenance
5% ‚Äì Logging/monitoring
7% ‚Äì Storage
10% ‚Äì Troubleshooting


Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
-------------------------------------------------
The CKAD tests your ability to deploy and configure applications running on the Kubernetes cluster and your understanding of some core concepts. You‚Äôll have two hours to complete the CKAD exam. Scoring a 66% or higher means you‚Äôve passed.

For the CKAD exam, you will be tested in the following areas:

13% ‚Äì Core concepts
18% ‚Äì Configuration
10% ‚Äì Multi-container pods
18% ‚Äì Observability
20% ‚Äì Pod design
13% ‚Äì Services & networking
8% ‚Äì State persistence

ExamTips
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After 2 years of procrastination, finally booked the CKA certification exam.

Happy to share that I passed Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam today with 91% score.

I can never thank enough Mr. Mumshad Mannambeth for the excellent course, keeping concepts simple yet informative. His solution walkthroughs on KodeKloud labs were so helpful. Also I thank Udemy for bringing the best lecturer to the platform.

Tips for CKA exam prep:
üí° 1. Check your understanding on below competencies (source: https://t.ly/gtXI)
     -  Storage : Persistent Volumes, mountpoints, storage classes etc.
     - Troubleshooting: debugging services on nodes, debugging error logs, understanding node logs, using metrics server
     -  Workloads & Scheduling: Understanding deployments, manifest files, RBAC
     -  Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration: Cluster setup, Kubeadm, k8 version upgrades
     - Services & Networking: Ingress, Network policies, Network interface plugins, CoreDNS, connectivity between pods and services, various ports.   
üí°2. k8 documentation:
     - Practice all tasks in the documentation (https://lnkd.in/gCsHrdjp)
     - Make a habit of checking k8 documentation for manifest formats, it comes handy during exam.
     - Only official documentation is allowed on the exam remote desktop.
üí°3. Mock exams:
     - Experience the exam environment which is remote desktop, in killerKoda (https://t.ly/1wYz)
     - KodeKloud mock exams that comes with Udemy course (https://t.ly/4Vf8) to get an idea how questions would be.
     - I highly reccommed to take exam simulator by Killer.sh only before 1 week to your exam. (you will get 2 free sessions on purchase of exam), the questions you face in this are lot tougher than the real exam.
üí°4. Commands:
     - Practice imperative commands for pods, deployments and services. Instead of writing manifest files from scratch.
     - Try to make use of short commands using alias.
             
üí°5. Main exam:
     - CKA exam time limit of 2 hours with 17 questions, each with different weights (4%, 5%, 7%, 13%), you need to get 66% to pass the exam.
     - All 7% looks simple in plain, but you have to pay attention to each detail. It may have two or three steps in it.
     - After implementing a task, take some time to test it.
     - Don‚Äôt stick to the hard question more than 10mins. Just flag it, you can visit back after completing easy ones.
     - Always you have one free retake, if you fail first time dont worry. Practice well to score well.

üí°6. Patience, Preparation and Practice :
     - It was not an easy thing to crack this test, needs a lot of patience to give time to understand and prepare notes on each concept. I took nearly a month for practicing all scenarios
