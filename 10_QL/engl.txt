"We use an automated CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins. 
Whenever a service needs to be deployed to production or the test environment, we use this pipeline to ensure smooth and consistent deployments."


"In our Java Spring Boot services, we use @ControllerAdvice for centralized error and exception handling. 
Additionally, we sometimes use try-catch blocks manually to handle specific exceptions in our code."


"Our DB team usually handles query optimization and other database-related tasks. 
As a backend developer, I collaborate with them to ensure efficient queries and help determine the best solution for our services or specific business requirements. 
Although I do not work directly on the database, I have a good understanding of RDS, including how it works, 
the purpose of tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, and the use of DML and DDL commands."



"In our service, we have a proper logging and monitoring system. Based on the logs and alerts, we quickly analyze production issues. 
For example, we may receive alerts that a host’s storage is full, integrations or databases are responding slowly, or service-to-service communication fails.
We use this information to identify the root cause and take appropriate action to resolve the problem."



"When I reach the office, I keep my bag on the table, go to the washroom to freshen up, drink two glasses of water, 
and then sit in my chair to start work, following my to-do list."


"I’m very proud of my current project because I’m the technical lead here.
and, taking complete ownership of the entire system, managing it both technically and strategically.
I consistently support my team with the guidance they need.
and Really, This is a robust, scalable excellent solution that runs smoothly on production.
Because of this, I am proud of my contribution to this project and my current role."


"Currently, I’m working as a Lead Software Engineer.
My goal is to become a Principal Software Engineer within the next two years, and then move into Architect role within the next three years.
So overall, my target is to become a skilled software Architect within the next five years."


"We usually manage our day-to-day project tasks using JIRA, and we hold daily stand-up meetings to stay aligned with the team.
I also maintain a personal to-do list to organize my all daily activities — including office tasks, family responsibilities, and personal errands.
This helps me stay focused and manage my time more efficiently throughout the day"



“On weekends, I like to spend time with my family, especially my children, and I usually do that.
Sometimes, I hang out with my friends.
On some weekends, I get invitations from my relatives or colleagues.
So, I join their gatherings and enjoy the time.
This is how I enjoy my weekends.”



"I’m currently working on a telco-based microservices solution that handles around 40 million requests per day.
I serve as a Lead Engineer, taking complete ownership of the entire system and managing it both technically and strategically.
Our core technology stack includes Java and Spring, especially Spring Cloud for building the microservices.
We also use OAuth2, Redis, Kafka, Jenkins,Grafana/Loki  Nginx more.
Overall, we work with a range of modern technologies across different parts of the project."



"In our team, we follow clear documentation, rules, and processes.
Because of this, most day-to-day and ongoing tasks run smoothly without requiring constant supervision.

When we receive a Change Request (CR) from the business team, we analyze and break down the requirements.
Once the implementation plan is clear, I assign the task to the most suitable and available team member.

If any technical challenge arises, either during a CR or in an ongoing project—and the assigned team members are unable to solve it, 
I take it over, analyze the issue, and work on the solution myself.

Additionally, when new technologies or unfamiliar tools are required in a project, I take the lead. 
I evaluate the technology, and how it fits with our system.
If it meets our needs, I test and implement it myself like a POC Project.

This is how I support my team both technically and strategically."



"Yes, I have been working with Agile methodology for the last five years.
In my current project, we use Agile practices to build and deploy all deliverables efficiently."



"To ensure quality in our project, we follow several key strategies.
we write clean and reusable code and ensure all team members follow standard coding practices.
We also perform code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
Additionally, we implement automated testing tools for unit tests and integration tests using the latest tools and technologies.
This is how I help ensure code and software quality in my projects."

"Mr. Asif, how many media channels are already integrated into your system, and are they all working? 
Do you frequently need to add or remove media? 
Also, is there any requirement to temporarily disable a channel or media for a specific period and then enable it again?"


"If I understand the requirements correctly, the system handles multiple media channels, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Play Store.
When End users make comment on Facebook posts, YouTube videos, Instagram posts, Play Store apps, and send messages via Facebook Messenger.
The proposed system should receive all these events, and agents will reply to them.
For the business email channel, customers can send emails to that address, and the system will receive and respond to them.
This is the core functionality and business requirement of your system. Did I miss anything?"



"Could you describe the user access management in the current system? Specifically,  adding user and assign permissions?
What types of users and role exist in the current system?
Additionally, how do users log in, do they need to register themselves, or are they added directly into the system by an admin?"



"If you provide a high-level media event flow — for example, when a Facebook comment or YouTube comment occurs — how is it assign to an agent?
From the document, I understand that the task is assign automatically and equally distributed to the available agents based on their role and threshold.
That means there is no queue in between; when an event occurs, it is directly assigned to an available agent according to their role.
So, am I correct that there is no queue-based logic here, and no queue is needed at all?"



"Can you share the experience of the current system data synchronization? 
For example, when a event happens—like a user comment on a Facebook post, YouTube video or a customer sent an email,
how quickly does this data appear in current system? 
Is it real-time, or does it take some time before it becomes visible in the system?"



"Is there any time-based limitation or business logic applied when capturing media in the current system? 
For example, if a post from two years ago receives a new comment today, will that comment to be captured? 
Or is there a restriction, such as ignoring comments on posts older than two years? 
What is the actual business requirement regarding this?"



"I need to clarify something. 
You mentioned that the system follows a topology where ``a task will always search for a previous handler first, 
then any handler of that particular Post ID and  then team and then available agent with the required capability. 
Could you please clarify this process in a bit more detail?" 



"The document says that a customer’s previous interaction history should be available.
How much of this history should be accessible?
Should we show the entire history, or apply some rules, like showing only recent conversations or conversations across different agents, pages, or posts?
Also, how should these conversations be displayed?"



"Could you describe the types of reports available in your current system? 
How frequently are these reports generated—daily, weekly, monthly, or annually? Are they produced at fixed intervals or generated on-demand? 
Additionally, could you explain the reporting mechanism, including how reports are created, accessed, and downloaded."



"Mr. Asif, is the service running 24 hours a day, or is there any scheduled downtime? 
Does the system operate continuously, or is it only available during certain hours?"



"Mr. Asif, can you please share which module in your system is used the most by users?
Which module or feature sees the busiest activity, such as a dashboard or reporting tool?"



"Are there any features or functionalities in current system that you or other users no longer use, 
or any reports that you consider obsolete because they don’t provide business value any more?"







================================================
"Yes, there was a situation when I had to quickly build a CI/CD pipeline for our project.
We use a microservice architecture, so as traffic increases, we need to add more cluster nodes, making deployment more complex.
Therefore, we required an automated CI/CD pipeline to simplify deployment.
I took responsibility for building this pipeline and quickly learned how to create and implement it using Jenkins."



"Last month, I solved a problem under pressure when a service started returning 404 errors to client requests. 
I got a call from our manager and quickly analyzed the logs. 
I found that NGINX had old configurations from a previous CR deployment, and a junior developer had not properly updated the Git repository. 
When the configurations synced across the Active-Active nodes, it caused the issue. 
I fixed it promptly and restored the service within half an hour. This prevented downtime and satisfied our manager and stakeholders."



"I have strong analytical skills that allow me to break down complex systems, design effective solutions, and ensure successful implementation."


"To keep myself up to date with the latest technology, I use several strategies.
I read the latest technical journals, online portals, and various technology news sites.
I also join several groups and communities on LinkedIn and GitHub to stay informed and connected."


"I have a strong technical foundation and many years of experience in the tech industry.
I remind myself that I have already dealt with a lot of challenges before.
So, I motivate myself to keep going, not give up, and believe that I will find the solution.
If I cannot solve it, who else can? If somebody is able to solve it, then I can too."


"When I face tight deadlines or pressure at work, I stay calm and focused.
First, I break the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and prioritize them.
I communicate clearly with my team and stakeholders to set realistic expectations and distribute tasks effectively.
If needed, I ask my team for help to handle extra work while ensuring quality.
This is how I manage my tasks under pressure."










================================================
"When a team member and I have different opinions on a technical approach, I first listen carefully to their perspective to understand their reasoning. 
Then, I explain my approach and the benefits of it. 
We discuss the pros and cons of both approaches and try to reach a common solution that is best for the project. 
If needed, we consult documentation or seek advice from a senior engineer to make a final decision."


"I welcome feedback from my manager and peers because it helps me improve.
When I receive feedback, I listen carefully without interrupting and try to understand their perspective.
I ask questions if I need clarification.
Then, I take the feedback positively and work on the areas where I can improve.
I also thank them for their input and follow up to show that I’m applying their suggestions."


"When I have multiple deadlines, I prioritize my tasks using the categories: must-have, could-have, and nice-to-have.
Based on this, I create a timeline and make a to-do list to organize my work efficiently.
Then, I start working on the most critical tasks first to meet deadlines effectively."


"When conflicts arise within my team, I address them promptly through open and respectful communication.
I listen carefully to all sides to understand the root cause of the conflict.
Then I analyze the situation and consider everyone’s views to find a common solution.
Finally, I make the decision that brings the maximum benefit to our project and company.
I share this decision with all team members to help convince them that it is the best way forward."

===============================================
##🔑 1. Sentence Structure (S–V–O Basics)
===============================================
Core Rule:
    Subject (S) + Verb (V) + Object (O)   |  This is the default structure in English.

Example:
    I   (S) eat   (V) rice   (O).
    She (S) likes (V) coffee (O).


English sentence needs at least a Subject + Verb, object is optional.
S + V (no object):
                    He sleeps.
                    They run.

S + V + O + O (two objects):
    He gave me a gift.
    She told us a story.

S + V + O + Complement (extra info about object):
    They made me happy.
    We elected him president.


Sentence Expansion (Add Details):
👉 Rule: S + V + O + (extra info) | You can add time, place, manner → usually after the object.

    I eat rice at night.                (time)
    She reads a book in the library.    (place)
    He drives a car carefully.          (manner)



👉 English word order is fixed (unlike Bangla).
   Always: Subject → Verb → Object → Extra


Try to make sentences with this pattern:
    S + V → I run.
    S + V + O → I play football.
    S + V + O + Extra → I play football in the park.
    S + V + O + O → He gave me a pen.



✅  If you master this, you can already communicate 60–70% of your daily thoughts in English.
    Later grammar (tenses, questions, modals) only modifies this core structure.




##Subject (S)
================================================
👉 The doer/agent of the action — the person, place, thing, or idea doing something.
   The person, thing, or idea that performs the action in a sentence, It usually comes at the beginning of the sentence.


Find the verb (the action).
    Ask: “Who or what is doing this action?” → That’s your Subject.
        Example:
        She reads books. → Verb = reads → Who reads? → She = Subject.
        The dog chases the cat. → Verb = chases → Who chases? → The dog = Subject.

Examples of Subjects:
    1. Pronouns (very common in daily speech)
        I → I eat rice.
        You → You watch TV.
        He → He reads books.
        She → She drinks tea.
        It → It rains today.
        We → We play football.
        They → They study English.

    2. Nouns (people, places, things)
        John → John eats pizza.
        My friend → My friend likes music.
        The teacher → The teacher teaches students.
        The dog → The dog runs fast.
        The children → The children play games.
        Bangladesh → Bangladesh is beautiful.
        The park is full of children.
        The school opens at 8 a.m.
        The car runs fast.
        Music makes people happy.
        The computer works slowly.

    3. Ideas / Things / Groups
        Happiness → Happiness motivates people.
        The news → The news shocks everyone.
        Football team → The football team won the match.






##Verb (V)
================================================
👉 What the subject is doing—>  The action word = Verb
    
Find the subject first.
    Ask: “What is the subject doing?” → That’s the verb.

A verb is usually an action word – it shows what someone does:
                                                                I eat rice. → eat = action
                                                                She runs fast. → runs = action

But sometimes a verb doesn’t show an action. It shows a state or condition — this is called a “state of being”.
In English, the main “state of being” verbs are: (am, is, are, was, were):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sentence            | Subject | Verb (State of Being) | Meaning                 |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| I **am** happy.     | I       | am                    | shows condition/feeling |
| She **is** tired.   | She     | is                    | shows condition         |
| They **are** ready. | They    | are                   | shows state             |
| He **was** late.    | He      | was                   | shows past state        |
| We **were** busy.   | We      | were                  |                         |

================================================
💥 💥 💥 must-have formula — here it is.
================================================
S - Speak out loud daily (no excuses)
P - Practice real situations (work, meetings, interviews)
E - Expand vocabulary & sentence patterns
A - Actively listen & mimic native tone
K - Know your mistakes & fix them weekly



🔐 Your Non-Negotiable Daily Routine (30 minutes):
================================================
Time	Task
10m	    Mirror Talk – Talk about your day/work. No Bengali. Full English.
10m	    Listening + Shadowing – Watch 3-5 mins of a professional speaker. Repeat exactly with tone.
5m	    Record Yourself – Answer: “What did I do today?” or “How do I solve a problem?”
5m	    Note 3 mistakes or weak points – Write better sentences next to them.


🎯 Weekly Must-Do:
================================================
Every Friday: Shadow a TED speaker for 10 mins.
Every Saturday: Simulate a meeting or interview (with a friend or AI).
Every Sunday: Self-reflection: Record “What I improved this week in English.”



Public & Professional Confidence Trick:
================================================
Prepare 10 fallback phrases you can use in any meeting or public talk.
Examples:
    “That’s a great question, let me explain…”
    “From my experience working on [project]...”
    “To summarize, we should focus on…”
Speak slower, use hand gestures — don’t rush. People will respect you more.
Smile + Eye contact — even if grammar isn't perfect, confidence sells your English.
