#AWS Services Scope | Area
================================================= 
Availability zones (AZs) are isolated data centers located within specific regions.
AZ is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region.

IAM
	Users, Groups, Roles, Accounts – Global
		Same AWS accounts, users, groups and roles can be used in all regions
	Key Pairs – Global or Regional
		Amazon EC2 created key pairs are specific to the region
		RSA key pair can be created and uploaded that can be used in all regions
Virtual Private Cloud
	VPC – Regional
		VPC are created within a region
	Subnet – Availability Zone
		Subnet can span only a single Availability Zone
	Security groups – Regional
		A security group is tied to a region and can be assigned only to instances in the same region.
	VPC Endpoints – Regional
		You cannot create an endpoint between a VPC and an AWS service in a different region.
	VPC Peering – Regional
		VPC Peering can be performed across VPC in the same account of different AWS accounts but only within the same region. 
		They cannot span across regions
		VPC Peering can now span inter-region
	Elastic IP Address – Regional
		Elastic IP address created within the region can be assigned to instances within the region only
EC2
	Resource Identifiers – Regional
		Each resource identifier, such as an AMI ID, instance ID, EBS volume ID, or EBS snapshot ID, is tied to its region and 
		can be used only in the region where you created the resource.
	Instances – Availability Zone
		An instance is tied to the Availability Zones in which you launched it. However, note that its instance ID is tied to the region.
	EBS Volumes – Availability Zone
		Amazon EBS volume is tied to its Availability Zone and can be attached only to instances in the same Availability Zone.
	EBS Snapshot – Regional
		An EBS snapshot is tied to its region and can only be used to create volumes in the same region and has to be copied from 
		One region to other if needed.
AMIs – Regional
	AMI provides templates to launch EC2 instances
	AMI is tied to the Region where its files are located with Amazon S3. For using AMI in different regions, the AMI can be copied 
	to other regions.
Auto Scaling – Regional
	Auto Scaling spans across multiple Availability Zones within the same region but cannot span across regions
Elastic Load Balancer – Regional
	Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across instances in multiple Availability Zones in the same region
Cluster Placement Groups – Availability Zone
	Cluster Placement groups can be span across Instances within the same Availability Zones
S3 – Global but Data is Regional
	S3 buckets are created within the selected region
	Objects stored are replicated across Availability Zones to provide high durability but are not cross region replicated unless 
	done explicitly.
Route53 – Global
	Route53 services are offered at AWS edge locations and are global
DynamoDb – Regional
	All data objects are stored within the same region and replicated across multiple Availability Zones in the same region
	Data objects can be explicitly replicated across regions using cross-region replication
WAF – Global
	Web Application Firewall (WAF) services protects web applications from common web exploits are offered at AWS edge locations 
	and are global
CloudFront – Global
	CloudFront is the global content delivery network (CDN) services are offered at AWS edge locations
Storage Gateway – Regional
	AWS Storage Gateway stores volume, snapshot, and tape data in the AWS region in which the gateway is activated
AWS Config – Regional
AWS GuardDuty – Regional
