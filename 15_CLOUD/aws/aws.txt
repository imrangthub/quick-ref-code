119
##VPC Reachability Analyzer
-------------------------------------------------
VPC Reachability Analyzer to determine whether a destination resource in your virtual private cloud (VPC) is reachable 
from a source resource. 


• A network diagnostics tool that troubleshoots network connectivity between two endpoints in your VPC(s)
• It builds a model of the network configuration, then checks the reachability based on these configurations (it doesn’t send packets).
• When the destination is
	• Reachable – it produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path
	• Not reachable – it identifies the blocking component(s) (e.g., config



Area:
=====
MayGlobal


UseCase:
========
Troubleshoot connectivity issues,
ensure network configuration is as intended,



BillCost:
=========
You are charged per analysis run between a source and destination.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.





116
##DNS Resolution
-------------------------------------------------
DNS Resolution (enableDnsSupport)
• Decides if DNS resolution from Route 53 Resolver server is supported for the VPC
• True (default): it queries the Amazon Provider DNS Server at 169.254.169.253 or the
reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two (.2)

DNS Hostnames (enableDnsHostnames)
• By default,
• True => default VPC
• False => newly created VPCs
• Won’t do anything unless enableDnsSupport=true
• If True, assigns public hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public IPv4

If you use custom DNS domain names in a Private Hosted Zone in
Route 53, you must set both these attributes (enableDnsSupport & enableDnsHostname) to true





117
##Route53 Private Zones
-------------------------------------------------
A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want Amazon Route 53 to respond to
DNS queries for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs that you create with the Amazon VPC service.

You create a private hosted zone, such as example.com, and specify the VPCs that you want to associate with the hosted zone.
Managing hosted zones: You pay a monthly charge for each hosted zone managed with Route 53.





21
#Data Warehouse
-------------------------------------------------
A data warehouse is a specialized type of relational database, which is optimized for
analysis and reporting of large amounts of data. It can be used to combine
transactional data from disparate sources (such as user behavior in a web application,
data from your finance and billing system, or customer relationship management or
CRM) to make them available for analysis and decision-making.

Traditionally, setting up, running, and scaling a data warehouse has been complicated
and expensive. On AWS, you can leverage Amazon Redshift, a managed data
warehouse service that is designed to operate at less than a tenth the cost of
traditional solutions.

us-east-1 will be chosen by default





72
##SAM (Serverless Appliction Model)
-------------------------------------------------
The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless 
applications on AWS.
A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work 
together to perform tasks.

All the configuration is YAML code:
• Lambda Functions
• DynamoDB tables
• API Gateway
• Cognito User Pools



Area:
=====
Regional.


UseCase:
========
Single-deployment configuration.
Extension of AWS CloudFormation.


BillCost:

73
##AWS Distributing Paid Content
-------------------------------------------------
You can configure CloudFront to require that users access your files using either signed URLs or signed cookies. 

Premium User Video service:
We have implemented a fully serverless solution:
• Cognito for authentication
• DynamoDB for storing users that are premium
• 2 serverless applications
	• Premium User registration
	• CloudFront Signed URL generator
• Content is stored in S3 (serverless and scalable)
• Integrated with CloudFront with OAI for security (users can’t bypass)
• CloudFront can only be used using Signed URLs to prevent unauthorized users
• What about S3 Signed URL? They’re not efficient for global access-enabled


An ending date and time, after which the URL is no longer valid.
(Optional) The date and time that the URL becomes valid.
(Optional) The IP address or range of addresses of the computers that can be used to access your content.






75
##Big Data Ingestion Pipeline
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different 
AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources, at specified intervals. 

With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where it’s stored, transform and process it at scale, 
and efficiently transfer the results to 
AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.


AWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, 
repeatable, and highly available. 
AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premises data silos.
 
AWS Data Pipeline is billed based on how often your activities and preconditions are scheduled to run and 
where they run (AWS or on-premises). 

 
Big Data Ingestion Pipeline discussion:
• IoT Core allows you to harvest data from IoT devices
• Kinesis is great for real-time data collection
• Firehose helps with data delivery to S3 in near real-time (1 minute)
• Lambda can help Firehose with data transformations
• Amazon S3 can trigger notifications to SQS
• Lambda can subscribe to SQS (we could have connecter S3 to Lambda)
• Athena is a serverless SQL service and results are stored in S3
• The reporting bucket contains analyzed data and can be used by reporting tool such as AWS QuickSight, Redshift, etc.

Security:
=========
Amazon Neptune supports HTTPS encrypted client connections and also allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you 
manage through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). 






92
##STS (Security Token Services)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS STS is an AWS service that allows you to request temporary security credentials for your AWS resources, 
for IAM authenticated users and users that are authenticated in AWS such as federated users via OpenID or SAML2.0.

You use STS to provide trusted users with temporary access to resources via API calls, your AWS console or 
the AWS command line interface (CLI)



AWS STS – Security Token Service:
• Allows to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources.
• Token is valid for up to one hour (must be refreshed)
• AssumeRole
• Within your own account: for enhanced security
• Cross Account Access: assume role in target account to perform actions there
• AssumeRoleWithSAML
• return credentials for users logged with SAML
• AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
• return creds for users logged with an IdP (Facebook Login, Google Login, OIDC compatible…)
• AWS recommends against using this, and using Cognito instead
• GetSessionToken
• for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user


Using STS to Assume a Role:
• Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
• Define which principals can access this IAM Role
• Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you
  have access to (AssumeRole API)
• Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour



Identity Federation in AWS:
• Federation lets users outside of AWS to assume temporary role for accessing AWS resources.
• These users assume identity provided access role.
Federations can have many flavors:
	• SAML 2.0
	• Custom Identity Broker
	• Web Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito
	• Web Identity Federation without Amazon Cognito
	• Single Sign On
	• Non-SAML with AWS Microsoft AD
Using federation, you don’t need to create IAM users (user management is outside of AWS)


ExamTips: Any time you see AssumeRole or Cross account access, its STS.

Area:
=====
STS is a global service


UseCase:
========
-Identity Federation Use-Case
-Cross-Account Access using AWS STS
-EC2 Instance STS Credentials



BillCost:
=========
No additional charge.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.






93
##Identity Federation & Cognito
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) enable you to create unique identities for your users and federate them 
with identity providers. 
With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services. 

Amazon Cognito identity pools support the following identity providers:
Public providers: Login with Amazon (identity pools), Facebook (identity pools), Google (identity pools), 
Sign in with Apple (identity pools).

Amazon Cognito user pools:
Open ID Connect providers (identity pools)
SAML identity providers (identity pools)
Developer authenticated identities (identity pools)


AWS Free Tier
Amazon Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only.

94
##Directory Services 
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD), 
enables your directory-aware workloads and AWS resources to use managed Active Directory (AD) in AWS.

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to use a directory in one account and share it with 
multiple accounts and VPCs.


AWS Managed Microsoft AD makes it easy to migrate AD-dependent applications and Windows workloads to AWS. 
With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can use Group Policies to manage EC2 instances and run AD-dependent applications in the 
AWS Cloud without the need to deploy your own AD infrastructure


AWS Directory Services:
AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	• Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
	• Establish “trust” connections with your on- premises AD
AD Connector
	• Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on- premises AD, supports MFA
	• Users are managed on the on-premises AD
Simple AD
	• AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
	• Cannot be joined with on-premises AD

Security:
=========
Managed Microsoft Active Directory
AWS Directory Service
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.







96
##RAM (Resource Access Manager)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) helps you securely share your resources across AWS accounts, within your organization or 
organizational units (OUs) in AWS Organizations, and with IAM roles and IAM users for supported resource types. 

You can use AWS RAM to share resources with other AWS accounts.
This eliminates the need to provision and manage resources in every account. 
When you share a resource with another account, that account is granted access to the resource and any 
policies and permissions in that account apply to the shared resource.


Avoid resource duplication!
VPC Subnets:
	• allow to have all the resources launched in the same subnets
	• must be from the same AWS Organizations.
	• Cannot share security groups and default VPC
	• Participants can manage their own resources in there
	• Participants can't view, modify, delete resources that belong to other participants or the owner
• AWS Transit Gateway
• Route53 Resolver Rules
• License Manager Configurations


Each account:
	• is responsible for its own resources
	• cannot view, modify or delete other resources in other accounts
Network is shared so:
	• Anything deployed in the VPC can talk to other resources in the VPC
	• Applications are accessed easily across accounts, using private IP!
	• Security groups from other accounts can be referenced for maximum security.







97
##AWS IAM Identity Center
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, 
centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.


Area:
=====
Global


UseCase:
========
Apply fine-grained permissions and scale with attribute-based access control
Manage per-account access or scale access across AWS accounts and applications


BillCost:
=========
IAM is offered at no additional charge.


Security:
=========
Cloud single-sign-on (SSO) service
AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO)

96
##CloudHSM
-------------------------------------------------
AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily 
generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. 

CloudHSM is standards-compliant and enables you to export all of your keys to most other
commercially-available HSMs, subject to your configurations. 


The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance 
requirements for data security by using dedicated 
Hardware Security Module (HSM) instances within the AWS cloud. 

AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules in the AWS Cloud. 
A hardware security module (HSM) is a computing device that 
processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys.


Q: What is a Hardware Security Module (HSM)?
A Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides secure key storage and cryptographic operations within a 
tamper-resistant hardware device. HSMs are designed to securely store cryptographic 
key material and use the key material without exposing it outside the cryptographic boundary of the hardware.


Q: What can I do with CloudHSM?
You can use the CloudHSM service to support a variety of use cases and applications, 
such as database encryption, Digital Rights Management (DRM), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 
authentication and authorization, document signing, and transaction processing.

There are no upfront costs to use AWS CloudHSM. With CloudHSM, you pay an hourly fee for each HSM you launch until you terminate the HSM.



• You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not AWS)
• Must use the CloudHSM Client Software
• Redshift supports CloudHSM for database encryption and key management
• Good option to use with SSE-C encryption



Area:
=====
Global.


UseCase:
========
Offload the SSL/TLS processing for web servers
Protect the private keys for an issuing certificate authority (CA)
Enable transparent data encryption (TDE) for Oracle databases

Generate, store, import, export, and manage cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs.
Use symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data.
Use cryptographic hash functions to compute message digests and hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs).

Cryptographically sign data (including code signing) and verify signatures.
Generate cryptographically secure random data.


BillCost:

##AWS PrivateLink
-------------------------------------------------
AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your 
traffic to the public internet. 

AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly 
simplify your network architecture.



VPC End Point Service
-------------------------------------------------
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by 
PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. 
Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. 
Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.


AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services):
• Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPC (own or other accounts)
• Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
• Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC) or GWLB
• If the NLB is in multiple AZ, and the ENIs in multiple AZ, the solution is fault tolerant! 




Area:
=====
MayRegional


UseCase:
========
This is useful because different AWS services often talk to each other over the internet. 
If you do not want that behavior and instead want AWS services to only communicate within the AWS network, use AWS PrivateLink. 
AWS PrivateLink connects your AWS services with other AWS services through a non-public tunnel.

126
##VPC Classic Link 
-------------------------------------------------
ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic instances to a VPC in your account, within the same Region. 
If you associate the VPC security groups with a EC2-Classic instance, this enables communication between your 
EC2-Classic instance and instances in your VPC using private IPv4 addresses.


Linking your EC2-Classic instance to a VPC does not affect your EC2-Classic security groups. 
They continue to control all traffic to and from the instance. 


EC2-Classic: instances run in a single network shared with other customers
• Amazon VPC: your instances run logically isolated to your AWS account
• ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic instances to a VPC in your account
	• Must associate a security group
	• Enables communication using private IPv4 addresses
	• Removes the need to make use of public IPv4 addresses or Elastic IP addresses
