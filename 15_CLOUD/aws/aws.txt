##AWS Policy Simulator | IAM
-------------------------------------------------
The AWS IAM Simulator is a tool that helps you to test the effects of IAM access control policies. 
This tool helps when you find yourself manually performing actions to test a policy. 
The IAM simulator can simulate actions for any IAM principal, resource, and policy conditions.

The simulator does not make an actual AWS service request, so you can safely test 
requests that might make unwanted changes to your live AWS environment.



#GraphQL:
------------------------------------------------
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the 
power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, 
and enables powerful developer tools.

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. 
GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they 
control the data they get, not the server.


#ECMP
-------------------------------------------------
Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) is a routing strategy where packet forwarding to a single destination can occur over multiple best paths with equal routing priority. 
Multi-path routing can be used in conjunction with most routing protocols because it is a per-hop local decision made independently at each router.


AWS Transit Gateway VPN supports ECMP protocol that can load balance traffic across multiple VPN tunnels. 
The question is, can Transit Gateway ECMP be used to deploy a transit DMZ as shown in the diagram below?






#Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
-------------------------------------------------
An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate 
High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. EFA enables you to achieve the application performance of 
an on-premises HPC cluster, with the scalability, flexibility, and elasticity provided by the AWS Cloud.

Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications 
requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS. 
Its custom-built operating system (OS) bypass hardware interface enhances the performance of inter-instance communications, 
which is critical to scaling these applications. 


You can create, use, and manage an EFA much like any other elastic network interface in Amazon EC2. 
However, unlike elastic network interfaces, EFAs cannot be attached to or detached from an instance in a running state.

Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run HPC applications 
requiring high levels of inter-instance communications, like computational fluid dynamics, weather modeling, 
and reservoir simulation, at scale on AWS. It uses a custom-built operating system bypass technique to enhance the 
performance of inter-instance communications, which is critical to scaling HPC applications. With EFA, 
HPC applications using popular HPC technologies like Message Passing Interface (MPI) can scale to thousands of CPU cores. 
EFA supports industry-standard libfabric APIs, so applications that use a supported MPI library can be 
migrated to AWS with little or no modification.

 
 
 
 
 
#ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)
-------------------------------------------------
The Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is designed to improve operating system health and reduce 
the chances of long-term disruption because of unexpected hardware behavior and or failures. 
The ENA architecture keeps device or driver failures as transparent to the system as possible. 
This topic provides troubleshooting information for ENA.

#With EC2
The Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver publishes network performance metrics from the instances where they are enabled. 
You can use these metrics to troubleshoot instance performance issues, choose the right instance size for a workload, 
plan scaling activities proactively, and benchmark applications to determine whether they maximize the
performance available on an instance.

#HPC (High Performance Computing)
-------------------------------------------------
Run your large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads in the cloud with a complete suite of 
high performance computing (HPC) products and services on AWS. Gain insights faster, and quickly
move from idea to market with virtually unlimited compute capacity, a high-performance file system,
and high-throughput networking.






#ParallelCluster 
-------------------------------------------------
AWS ParallelCluster is an open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High Performance 
Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. ParallelCluster uses a simple text file to model and provision all the 
resources needed for your HPC applications in an automated and secure manner. It also supports multiple 
instance types and job submission queues, and job schedulers like AWS Batch and Slurm.

AWS ParallelCluster is built on the popular open source CfnCluster project and is released via the Python Package Index (PyPI). 
ParallelCluster's source code is hosted on the Amazon Web Services repository on GitHub. 
AWS ParallelCluster is available at no additional charge, and you pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.





RTO and RPO
-------------------------------------------------
Among the components of a DR plan are two key parameters that define how long your business can afford to be offline and how
much data loss it can tolerate. These are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).


RTO:
RTO is the goal your organization sets for the maximum length of time it should take to restore normal 
operations following an outage or data loss.

RTO refers to how much time an application can be down without causing significant damage to the business. 
Some applications can be down for days without significant consequences. 

RTO is not simply the duration of time between loss and recovery. The objective also accounts for the steps 
IT must take to restore the application and its data.



RPO:
RPO is your goal for the maximum amount of data the organization can tolerate losing. 
This parameter is measured in time: from the moment a failure occurs to your last valid data backup. 
For example, if you experience a failure now and your last full data backup was 24 hours ago, the RPO is 24 hours. 


Recovery point objectives refer to your company’s loss tolerance: the amount of data that can be lost before significant 
harm to the business occurs. 

If you back up all or most of your data in regularly scheduled 24-hour increments, then in the worst-case scenario you 
will lose 24 hours’ worth of data.

For example, if you have a 4-hour RPO for an application then you will have a maximum 4-hour gap between backup and data loss.
Having a 4-hour RPO does not necessarily mean you will lose 4 hours’ worth of data.
