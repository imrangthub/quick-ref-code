#General | Basic | Info      
================================================= 
Just think of a schema as the “structure” or a “model” of your data in your database.

Remember that a relational database system does not scale well for the following reasons:
– It normalizes data and stores it on multiple tables that require multiple queries to write to disk.
– It generally incurs the performance costs of an ACID-compliant transaction system.
– It uses expensive joins to reassemble required views of query results.



CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across instances.
CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, 
on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.

AWS CodeDeploy fully automates your software deployments, allowing you to deploy reliably and rapidly.

For VPC:
Launch the EC2 instance to a private subnet and attach an Egress-Only 
Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet. 
Use AWS Network Firewall to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering.
 Internet Gateway does not limit or control any outgoing IPv6 connection.
 NAT Gateway is only applicable for IPv4, not IPv6.

• NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP(helpful for whitelisting specific IP)

ASG cannot directly use a Cloudwatch alarm as the source for a scale-in or scale-out event.
 
	Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability 

• 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:


AWS has a limit of 20 instances per region. 
When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance 


Policies can be attached to users, groups, or Amazon S3 buckets, enabling 
AWS supports six types of policies: 

On-Demand Capacity Reservations,

Simple scaling 

Determine which unprotected instances in the selected Availability Zone
EBS is incorrect because an EBS Volume cannot be shared by multiple instances.


You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region.


AWS Proton allows you to deploy any serverless or container-based application with increased efficiency, consistency, and control. You can define infrastructure standards and effective continuous delivery pipelines for your organization. Proton breaks down the infrastructure into environment and service (“infrastructure as code” templates).

Set up an AWS Control Tower Landing Zone. Enable pre-packaged guardrails to enforce policies or detect violations.

AWS Control Tower is used to simplify the creation of new accounts with preconfigured constraints. 
It isn’t used to automate application deployments. Moreover, AWS Config is commonly used for 
monitoring the changes of AWS resources and not the custom resources for serverless or 
container-based applications in AWS.

The Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is only a Prometheus-compatible monitoring and alerting service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications and infrastructure at scale.


WorkDocs is simply a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. It is not a suitable service for storing static content. Amazon WorkDocs is more often used to easily create, edit, and share documents for collaboration and not for serving object data like Amazon S3.

	Cross-Account AssumeRole
	VPC Peering
	Resource Access Manager
	VPC endpoint service
	Transit Gateway
	
AWS DataSync:Copy Data correctly.
	AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between 
	on premises and AWS Storage services. 

DataSync can copy data between NFS shares,SMB shares, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS), 
self-managed object storage, 
Snowcone, S3 buckets,EFS file systems, FSx for Windows,FSx for Lustre, FSz for OpenZFS, 
and FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.


AWS Data Migration Service:
	AWS Data Migration Service copies data between databases, also send data to Amazon S3, 
	Amazon Kinesis and Apache Kafka.

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it easy to migrate 
relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. 
You can use AWS DMS to migrate your data into the AWS Cloud or between combinations of 
cloud and on-premises setups.


AWS Storage Gateway:
	AWS Storage Gateway provides a virtual storage device that stores data in the cloud 
	(on S3, Glacier, FSx, etc). Think of it as a cloud-backed H: drive with unlimited storage.

	permanent connectivity to the Cloud.

One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. 
With this connection, you can create virtual interfaces directly to 
public AWS services S3 or to Amazon VPC, bypassing internet service providers in your network path.


AWS Site-to-Site VPN:
	AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a VPN connection between your office or data center and 
	AWS via existing data connections. For example, it can create a VPN connection across your existing 
	Internet fiber connection.

A Site-to-Site VPN connection offers two VPN tunnels between a virtual private gateway or a 
transit gateway on the AWS side, 
and a customer gateway (which represents a VPN device) on the remote (on-premises) side.

#Resilient:স্থিতিস্থাপক
-------------------------------------------------
You can use Aurora replicas and CloudFront distribution to make the application more resilient to 
spikes in request rates.




#Availability:প্রাপ্যতা, লভ্যতা
-------------------------------------------------
If you have workloads that global client base, AWS recommends that you use Global Accelerator. 

If you have workloads hosted in a single AWS Region and used by clients in 
and around the same Region, you can use an 
Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer to manage your resources.



Network Firewall cannot directly integrate with the Application Load Balancer.
AWS WAF straightforward way of integrating with an ALB but not Network Firewall with an ALB.




Ensure that the database is eventually consistent and highly available:
	Configure the Auto Scaling group to spread the Amazon EC2 instances across three Availability Zones. 
	Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with a replication server and an ongoing replication 
	task to migrate the embedded NoSQL database to Amazon DynamoDB.



How ALB prevent SQL injection attacks:
	Use WAF and set up a managed rule to block request patterns associated with the exploitation 
	of SQL databases, like SQL injection attacks. Associate it with the Application Load Balancer. 
	Integrate AWS WAF with AWS Firewall Manager to reuse the rules across all the AWS accounts.


AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential 
	network protections for all of your VPCs.

Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall can only filter and regulate outbound DNS traffic for your VPC.
	It can neither do active traffic flow inspection nor block any vulnerability exploits.



Redshift(SQL Big data analyse) cluster as their data warehouse region outage or down:
	Enable Cross-Region Snapshots Copy in your Amazon Redshift Cluster.


Convert audio recordings into text using Amazon Transcribe. 
Set up Amazon Translate to translate Hindi texts into English and use Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis.


Process both mission-critical data and non-essential batch jobs:
	Use ECS as the container management service then set up a combination of Reserved and 
	Spot EC2 Instances for processing mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs respectively.
    Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances).


S3Select:
	Amazon S3 Select is designed to help analyze and process data within an object in Amazon S3 buckets, 
	faster and cheaper. 
	It works by providing the ability to retrieve a subset of data from an object in S3 using SQL.


Athena:
	Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in S3 using standard SQL.
	Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using SQL expressions.



Redshift Spectrum:
	Amazon Redshift also includes Redshift Spectrum, allowing you to directly run SQL queries 
	against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3. 
	No loading or transformation is required, 
	and you can use open data formats, including Avro, CSV, Grok, ORC, Parquet, RCFile, RegexSerDe, 
	SequenceFile, TextFile, and TSV. Redshift Spectrum automatically scales query compute capacity 
	based on the data being retrieved, so queries against Amazon S3 run fast, regardless of data set size.



S3 retrieve the required data in under 15 minutes under all circumstances 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput:
	Use Expedited Retrieval to access the financial data.
	Purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.

Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent requests 
for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archives (250 MB+), data accessed 
using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. 

Provisioned capacity ensures that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals 
is available when you need it.

Collect and process the application log files:
Amazon S3 for storing the application log files and Amazon Elastic MapReduce for processing the log files.




Fastest storage option with high I/OPerformance for the temporary files:
	Configure RAID 0 in multiple instance store volumes.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is just a data storage virtualization technology 
that combines multiple storage devices to achieve higher performance or data durability.

RAID 0 configuration enables you to improve your storage volumes’ performance 
by distributing the I/O across the volumes in a stripe. 
	
This configuration can be implemented on both EBS or InstanceStore volumes. 

RAID 1 configuration is used for data mirroring. 
You need to configure RAID 0 to improve the performance of your storage volumes.



Following resources can be attach to your Transit Gateway:
	– One or more VPCs.
	– One or more VPN connections
	– One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways
	– One or more Transit Gateway Connect attachments
	– One or more Transit gateway peering connections
	


 
RDS if the primary database instance fails:
The canonical name record (CNAME) is switched from the primary to standby instance.



For Single RDS security use SecurityGroup not Network ACL.
	Network ACL covers the entire subnet which means that other applications that use the same 
	subnet will also be affected.


A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default to a maximum of 8760 hours (365 days).


ASG:
	With Step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that 
	trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a 
	threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods. Step scaling policies 
	increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target based on a set of scaling adjustments, 
	known as step adjustments. 


CloudWatch:
	By default, CloudWatch doesn’t monitor memory usage but only the -
	CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Reads/Writes.

EC2 Detailed Monitoring does not provide metrics for memory usage,
just provides a higher frequency of metrics (1-minute frequency). 




AWS Transfer:
	Create an Amazon S3 bucket with encryption enabled. 
	Launch an AWS Transfer for SFTP endpoint to securely upload files to the S3 bucket. 
	Configure an S3 lifecycle rule to delete files after a month.




@@
Storage optimized instances:
	Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, 
	sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.

Memory Optimized Instances:
	Memory Optimized Instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process 
	large data sets in memory, which is quite different from handling 
	high read and write capacity on local storage.



EMR(Big Data Frameworks):
	Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as 
	Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. 
	By using these frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, 
	you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. 
	Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out 
	of other AWS data stores and databases.




Amazon Redshift is the most widely used cloud data warehouse:I
	analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools. 
	It allows you to run complex analytic queries against terabytes to petabytes of 
	structured and semi-structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage 
	on high-performance storage, and massively parallel query execution.



DynamoDB:
	DynamoDB doesn’t fully support the use of standard SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) tools, 
	unlike Amazon Redshift. It also doesn’t allow you to run complex analytic queries against 
	terabytes to petabytes of structured and semi-structured data.


Virtual Desktops:
	First, you need a VPN connection to connect the VPC and your on-premises network. 
	Second, you need AWS Directory Services to integrate with your on-premises Active Directory 
	and lastly, you need to use Amazon Workspace to create the needed Virtual Desktops in your VPC.



SAML 2.0:
	Before you can use SAML 2.0-based federation you must configure your organization’s IdP 
	and your AWS account to trust each other. 
	Inside your organization, you must have an IdP that supports SAML 2.0, 
	like Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS, part of Windows Server), Shibboleth, 
	or another SAML 2.0 compatible provider.



DataSync:
	AWS DataSync is primarily used to migrate existing data to Amazon S3. 
	AWS Storage Gateway is more suitable if you still want to retain access to the migrated data 
	and for ongoing updates from your on-premises file-based applications.



Amazon EFS only supports file locking. Object lock is a feature of Amazon S3 and not Amazon EFS.




Create a native function or a stored procedure that invokes a Lambda function. 
Configure the Lambda function to send event notifications to an Amazon SQS queue for the 
processing system to consume.



AWS Artifact:
	Use AWS Artifact to view the security reports as well as other AWS compliance-related information.
	AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. 
	It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. 
	Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, 
	Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across 
	geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of 
	AWS security controls. 
	Agreements available in AWS Artifact include the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and the 
	Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).




Create an Amazon S3 bucket with encryption enabled:
	Launch an AWS Transfer for SFTP endpoint to securely upload files to the S3 bucket. 
	Configure an S3 lifecycle rule to delete files after a month.
	There is no retention policy option on AWS Transfer for SFTP.



You can use EventBridge to run ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur.



AWS Central Tower (Multiple acc):
	AWS Central Tower service is primarily used to manage and govern multiple AWS accounts and not just S3.



ParallelCluster @(open-source cluster management tool):
	AWS ParallelCluster is simply an AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy 
	for you to deploy and manage High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS.



AWS Proton @(“infrastructure as code” templates):
	AWS Proton allows you to deploy any serverless or container-based application with 
	increased efficiency, consistency, and control. 
	You can define infrastructure standards and effective continuous delivery pipelines for your organization. 
	Proton breaks down the infrastructure into environment and service.



Filter policies in SNS @(SNS Queue Filter):
	Create one Amazon SNS topic and configure the Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the SNS topic. 
	Set the filter policies in the SNS subscriptions to publish the message to the 
	designated SQS queue based on its quote request type.



AWS Organizations and AD @(IAMIdentityCenter):
	On the master account, use AWS Organizations to create a new organization with all features turned on. 
	Invite the child accounts to this new organization.
	Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) for the organization 
	and integrate it with the company’s directory service using the Active Directory Connector
	 
	Amazon Cognito is used for single sign-on in mobile and web applications. 
	You don’t have to use it if you already have an existing Directory Service to be used for authentication.

DynamoDB and AWS Backup: @(backups to another AWS account for disaster recovery):
	Create a DynamoDB gateway endpoint. Associate the endpoint to the appropriate route table. 
	Use AWS Backup to automatically copy the on-demand DynamoDB backups to another AWS account for disaster recovery.

	Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) feature is not capable of restoring a DynamoDB table to a 
	particular point in time in a different AWS account.

DynamoDB on-demand backups are available at no additional cost beyond the normal pricing that’s 
associated with backup storage size. DynamoDB on-demand backups cannot be copied to a
different account or Region. 

To create backup copies across AWS accounts and Regions and for other advanced features, use AWS Backup.
Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.


Storage Gateway:
	Amazon Storage Gateway is used only for creating a backup of data from your on-premises server 
	and not from the Amazon services.

	Use AWS Storage Gateway to backup the data directly to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
	Snowball Edge can’t directly integrate backups to S3 Glacier.

Minimize the impact of DDoS attacks:
	Configure Amazon CloudFront distribution and set Application Load Balancer as the origin. 
	Create a rate-based web ACL rule using AWS WAF and associate it with Amazon CloudFront.

By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) for your CloudFront distributions 
or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. 



Department base bill:
	Tag resources with the department name and enable cost allocation tags.



MySQL database that needs to be replicated in Amazon S3 as CSV files:
	Create a full load and change data capture (CDC) replication task using AWS Database Migration Service 
	(AWS DMS). Add a new Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and create an AWS DMS endpoint with SSL.

When using Amazon S3 as a target in an AWS DMS task, both full load and change data capture (CDC) 
data is written to comma-separated value (.csv) format by default.



Snowball:
	AWS Snowball devices to upload the files to Amazon S3. the primary goal is one-time migration 
	of data to AWS which can be accomplished by using AWS Snowball devices.



WorkDocs simply enables you to share content, provide rich feedback, and collaboratively edit documents.



ENI:
	If the instance fails, you (or more likely, the code running on your behalf) can attach 
	the network interface to a hot standby instance.
 
 
 
 
Detected Unauthorized person using Cameras, the security team must be alerted via SMS:

	fraudulent online activities such as online payment fraud and fake account creation.

AWS Trusted Advisor only provides best practice recommendations. It cannot define rules 
for your AWS resources.


EBS volumes live configuration Change:
	EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production, which means that you can modify 
	the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
	An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance.



Amazon SQS and Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) are the services that you can 
use for creating a decoupled architecture in AWS. 


You can’t create a VPC peering for your on-premises network and AWS VPC.



AWS Control Tower:
	Set up an AWS Control Tower Landing Zone. Enable pre-packaged guardrails to enforce policies or 
	detect violations.
	AWS Control Tower provides a single location to easily set up your new well-architected multi-account 
	environment and govern your AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and internal compliance.
	
AWS Control Tower provides three methods for creating member accounts:
	– Through the Account Factory console that is part of AWS Service Catalog.
	– Through the Enroll account feature within AWS Control Tower.
	– From your AWS Control Tower landing zone’s management account, using Lambda code 
	  and appropriate IAM roles.

AWS Control Tower automatically implements guardrails using multiple building blocks such as 
AWS CloudFormation to establish a baseline, AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) 
to prevent configuration changes, and AWS Config rules to continuously detect non-conformance.



Systems Manager Parameter:
	Systems Manager Parameter Store doesn’t rotate its parameters by default.
	Use AWS Secrets Manager to store and encrypt the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. 
	Enable automatic rotation for all of the credentials.

KMS is primarily used for encryption and not for hosting your credentials.


SQS @(retention period ):
	In Amazon SQS, you can configure the message retention period to a value from 1 minute to 14 days. 
	Default is 4 days. Once the message retention limit is reached, messages are automatically deleted.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data. 
Although it can stream data to an S3 bucket, it is not suitable to be used as a queue 
for a batch application.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, 
and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you are already using today.


Amazon Redshift:
	Amazon Redshift is a fast( near real-time), scalable data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective 
	to analyze all your data across your data warehouse and data lake. 
	Redshift delivers ten times faster performance than other data warehouses by using machine learning, 
	massively parallel query execution, and columnar storage on a high-performance disk.


RealTime EC2 Log Processing:
	Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream.
	
	Kinesis Data Firehose  near RealTime.
	Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift(Analytics / BI / Data Warehouse) not RealTime processing.
	
	

RDS Mysql: increase the disk space without impacting:
	Modify the DB instance settings and enable storage autoscaling.
	RDS Storage Auto Scaling automatically scales storage capacity in response to growing database workloads, with zero downtime.

For Modify the DB instance settings and enable storage autoscaling.
aS Result: increasing the allocated storage might cause performance degradation during the change.



ELB LogProcessing with EMR:
	Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files.
	You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, 
	and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.



The “Trust Relationship” policy simply defines which Principals can Assume the IAM Role and under which conditions.





Error:EC2ThrottledException:
	Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. 
	If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure that your VPC has sufficient ENI capacity 
	to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function. 



Route53:
	You can use Route 53 health checking to configure active-active and active-passive failover configurations. 



Active-Active Failover:
	In active-active failover, all the records that have the same name, the same type (such as A or AAAA), and the same routing policy 
	(such as weighted or latency) are active unless Route 53 considers them unhealthy. 
	Route 53 can respond to a DNS query using any healthy record.
	Active-Active Failover no parimary or secondary resource.

Active-Passive Failover:
	Use an active-passive failover configuration when you want a primary resource or group of resources to be available 
	the majority of the time and you want a secondary resource or group of resources to be on standby in case all the 
	primary resources become unavailable.






Aurora  Backup:
	Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily snapshots with a retention period of 90 days.
	Maximum backup retention period for automated backup is only 35 days.



Aurora Instance class to Aurora Serverless:
	Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate to a new Aurora Serverless database.
	You can set up a DMS task for either one-time migration or ongoing replication.




AWS and On-Permiss Dedicated Conn (With multi AWS acc):
	Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. 
	Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.

VPC peering is not supported in a Direct Connect connection. VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships.
 
VPN connection traverses the public Internet and doesn’t use a dedicated connection.




CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) a feature ensures that  CloudFront can serve S3 content.
 
 
 

By default Network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
By default Security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic, no inbound rules. 




Kinesis Data Streams:
	Collect and process large streams of data records in real-time.
	The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real-time. 
	Consumers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2 or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) 
	can store their results using an AWS service such as  DynamoDB,  Redshift,  S3.


 
AWS Data Exchange is a data marketplace service. 
 
 
 
 
Need to use a service that can store and retrieve objects through 
standard file storage protocols for quick recovery:
	  Use the AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to store all the backup data in Amazon S3.
	  You cannot directly access the volume gateway using Amazon S3 APIs.
	 
	 
	 
S3:
	Access S3 buckets file using an S3 URL or through their CloudFront distribution:
	A better solution is to set up an origin access identity (OAI) then use Signed URL or Signed Cookies 
	in your CloudFront web distribution for Restrict access file.


S3 supports 3 destinations where it can publish events:
	1. SNS topic
	2. SQS queue
	3. AWS Lambda

S3 does public event messages to Amazon MQ. You should use an Amazon SQS instead.




Retrieve a subset of data from a large CSV file stored in an S3: 
	Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object's key.
	
Metadata is not needed when querying subsets of data in an object using S3 Select. 
Tags just provide additional information to your object, not needed when querying with S3 Select although this can be useful 
for S3 Batch Operations. 
 
 
 
S3 Cross-account Permissions to copy objects from a source bucket in Account A to a destination bucket in Account B:
	– Attach a bucket policy to the source bucket in Account A.
	– Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to a user or role in Account B.
	– Use the IAM user or role in Account B to perform the cross-account copy.
	 
	 
 
Aurora DB cluster:
	A reader endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster provides load-balancing support for read-only connections to the DB cluster.
	Cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster.



Kinesis stream Retation periond(1 to 365):
	A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours (1 day ) by default to a maximum of 8760 hours (365 days).
 
 
 
By default, Fargate tasks are given a minimum of 20 GiB of free ephemeral storage, 
	which meets the storage requirement in the scenario.



Interface endpoint vs Transit Gatewa:
	You pay an hourly rate for every provisioned Interface endpoint.
	AWS Transit Gatewa: VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.




RDS read-replica:

S3 Retrival within 15 minutes under all circumstances:
	If you require access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, you must purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.




ALB SSL MultipleCertificate:
	Upload all SSL certificates of the domains in the ALB using the console and bind multiple certificates to the 
	same secure listener on your load balancer. 
	ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client using Server Name Indication (SNI).

Wildcard certificate can only handle multiple sub-domains but not different domains.
 



S3 decrypted by the Lambda function call:
	Attach the kms:decrypt permission to the Lambda function’s execution role. 
	Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s execution role the kms:decrypt permission.



The /32 denotes one IP address, and the /0 refers to the entire network.



AWS DataSync(moving data between on-premises and AWS storage services like S3,EFS):
	AWS DataSync does not work with Amazon EBS volumes.
	DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage,
	AWS Snowcone, S3 buckets,Amazon EFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

 


CloudFormation template:
	Needs to ensure that the required components are properly running before the stack creation proceeds:
	Configure a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. 
	Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper script.

	UpdatePolicy attribute is primarily used for updating resources and for stack update rollback operations.
	
	UpdateReplacePolicy attribute is primarily used to retain or in some cases, back up the existing physical instance 
	of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.



Avoid losing recently submitted requests:
	Use an Amazon SQS queue to decouple the application components and scale-out the EC2 instances based upon the 
	ApproximateNumberOfMessages metric in Amazon CloudWatch.



Launch an IAM Group for each department. 
Create an IAM Policy that enforces MFA authentication with the least privilege permission. 
Attach the IAM Policy to each IAM Group.




SCP:
	SCP can only be attached to the organization root, to an organizational unit (OU), or directly to an account, 
	but not directly in the IAM User. 

	IAM role Cannot directly associate with IAM user.
	
You cannot attach Roles to Users and Groups, only Policies.

IAM User     = Single Account with credentials for login, e.g. JohnDoe
IAM Role     = Single Account without credentials, created for AWS Resources to "Assume".
IAM Group    = A collection of IAM Users.

IAM Policy   = Resource Access Rules.
Policies are added to Users, Roles, or Groups, to give them the permissions specified in the policy.




Secrets Manager Parameter vs Systems Manager Parameter:
	Secrets Manager there is a cost associated with using Store encrypted parameters. 
	If you are storing mostly application parameters, then the Systems Manager Parameter Store is a better fit
	with (AWS KMS) for the encryption.





You can’t have an Amazon S3 managed encryption key for client-side encryption.
– Set up Client-Side Encryption with a customer master key stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
– Set up Client-Side Encryption using a client-side master key.

If you got your certificate from a third-party CA, import the certificate into ACM or upload it to the IAM certificate store.

ACM lets you import third-party certificates from the ACM console, as well as programmatically. If ACM is not available in your region, use AWS CLI to upload your third-party certificate to the IAM certificate store.

envelope encryption, Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).

Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C),Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3): these two do not provide you 
with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom, unlike Server-Side Encryption 
with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).



two AWS services for issuing and deploying X.509 certificates:>

ACM Private CA—
Certificates issued by a private CA are trusted only within your organization, not on the internet.
With ACM Private CA, you can create your own CA hierarchy and issue certificates with it for authenticating internal users, computers, applications, services, servers, and other devices and for signing computer code.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) — (public certificates )This service manages certificates for enterprise customers who need a publicly trusted secure web presence using TLS. You can deploy ACM certificates into AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and other integrated services. 
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you can import certificates that you obtained outside of AWS.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you can import certificates that you obtained outside of AWS
Multiple certificates with the same domain name can be imported, but they must be imported one at a time.


Secure Connected RDS for MySQ:
Use IAM DB Authentication and create database accounts using the AWS-provided AWSAuthenticationPlugin plugin in MySQL.

You can authenticate to your DB instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
AWS-provided plugin that works seamlessly with IAM to authenticate your IAM users. 




allows or blocks web requests:
A geo match condition lists countries that your requests originate from.

Using AWS WAF, create a web ACL with a rule that explicitly allows requests from approved IP addresses declared in an IP Set.
Add another rule in the AWS WAF web ACL with a geo match condition that blocks requests that originate from a specific country.
if you want to prioritize resources for users in a particular country, you could include a geo-match condition in two different rate-based rules. 
Set a higher rate limit for users in the preferred country and set a lower rate limit for all other users.

If you are using the CloudFront geo restriction feature to block a country from accessing your content, any request from that country is blocked and is not forwarded to AWS WAF Classic. So if you want to allow or block requests based on geography plus other AWS WAF Classic conditions, you should not use the CloudFront geo restriction feature. Instead, you should use an AWS WAF Classic geo match condition.

ALB listener rule, It only determines how the load balancer routes the requests to its registered targets.
You can’t configure a geo match condition in an Application Load Balancer. 


AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you with real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. It inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations for saving money, improving system performance and reliability, or closing security gaps.

AWS Cost Explorer a tool that enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage.
 It has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

SimpleDB is also a highly available and scalable NoSQL database, it has a limit on the request capacity or storage size for a given table, unlike DynamoDB.


Amazon DynamoDB is use this to have an ACID-compliant database, it is not capable of handling complex queries and highly transactional (OLTP) workloads.

Amazon RDS not scalable to handle the growth of the database. 
Amazon Aurora is the better choice as its underlying storage can grow automatically as needed.



VPN connection to connect the VPC and your on-premises network. Second, you need AWS Directory Services to integrate with your on-premises Active Directory and lastly, you need to use Amazon Workspace to create the needed virtual desktops in your VPC.


Enable Enhanced Networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on the Windows EC2 Instances.
 Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.
 
 AWS ParallelCluster is just an AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. It does not provide higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and lower inter-instance latencies, unlike ENA or EFA.
 
 ALB  Conversely, it only allows 2 types of health check: HTTP and HTTPS.
  A TCP health check is only offered in Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers.



Assign the existing IAM role to instances in the new region.
 IAM roles are global services that are available to all regions.

Block the IP addresses in the Network Access Control List
You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.

a static Anycast IP address is primarily used by AWS Global Accelerator to enable organizations to route traffic seamlessly to multiple regions and improve availability and performance for their end-users.

Create a Web ACL rule in AWS WAF to block the specified country. Associate this rule to the Application Load Balancers. 


AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications. It provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.
Develop the application using the AWS AppSync service and use its built-in custom domain feature. Associate an SSL certificate to the AWS AppSync API using the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service to enable HTTPS communication.

When you configure an AWS AppSync API, two endpoints are provisioned:
AWS AppSync GraphQL endpoint:
AWS AppSync real-time endpoint:


The ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds is the queue attribute that determines whether you are using Short or Long polling. By default, its value is zero which means it is using Short polling. If it is set to a value greater than zero, then it is Long polling.

The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours in SQS.



With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods. 
 Step scaling policies increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments. 
 
 
 scaling up and down multiple times:
 Change the cooldown period of the Auto Scaling group and set the CloudWatch metric to a higher threshold
 
 
 
 Aurora failure on the primary database instance for failover:
 Aurora will attempt to create a new DB Instance in the same Availability Zone as the original instance and is done on a best-effort basis.
 
 
 If you have an Amazon Aurora Replica in the same or a different Availability Zone, when failing over, Amazon Aurora flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB Instance to point at the healthy replica, which in turn is promoted to become the new primary. Start-to-finish failover typically completes within 30 seconds.
 If you are running Aurora Serverless and the DB instance or AZ becomes unavailable, Aurora will automatically recreate the DB instance in a different AZ.
 If you do not have an Amazon Aurora Replica (i.e., single instance) and are not running Aurora Serverless, Aurora will attempt to create a new DB Instance in the same Availability Zone as the original instance. 
 For Single instance, no read repllica, Aurora will first attempt to create a new DB Instance in the same Availability Zone as the original instance. If unable to do so, Aurora will attempt to create a new DB Instance in a different Availability Zone and not the other way around.
 
 
 
 
 Test new version of Application with  50/50 request:
 Use an Application Elastic Load balancer with Weighted Target Groups to divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application.
 Use Route 53 with Weighted routing policy to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. 
 
 IP addresses from one of the following CIDR blocks
 – 10.0.0.0/8 (RFC 1918)
– 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598)
– 172.16.0.0/12 (RFC 1918)
– 192.168.0.0/16 (RFC 1918)
 Network Load balancer doesn’t have Weighted Target Groups.
 
 That makes heterogeneous migrations a two step process.:
 heterogeneous database migration in which you need to transform your on-premises Oracle database to PostgreSQL in AWS:
 First, use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and application code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database.
 
 
 if you have multiple web servers running on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, Route 53 will route all traffic addressed to your website (e.g. www.tutorialsdojo.com) to the load balancer DNS name (e.g. elbtutorialsdojo123.elb.amazonaws.com).
  CNAME records cannot be created for your zone apex. You should create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace which is also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name tutorialsdojo.com, the zone apex is tutorialsdojo.com. You can’t create a CNAME record directly for tutorialsdojo.com, but you can create an alias record for tutorialsdojo.com that routes traffic to www.tutorialsdojo.com.
  
  
  As a rule of thumb, most AWS services use VPC Interface Endpoint except for S3 and DynamoDB, which use VPC Gateway Endpoint.
  
  
 integrate or replicate the data->WS Storage Gateway
 migrate or move data->DataSync 
 Set up AWS DataSync to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Amazon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Data Events and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket.
 
 AWS Storage Gateway is more suitable to be used in integrating your storage services by replicating your data while AWS DataSync is better for workloads that require you to move or migrate your data.
 
 
 
 
Data Archive on S3 and frequently accessed data locally on their on-premises server:
Use the Amazon Storage Gateway – Cached Volumes.

Amazon SQS has automatically deleted the messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period.
The default message retention period is 4 days max 14 days.


Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transition to S3 – Standard IA after 30 days
Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transition the data from Standard storage class to Glacier after one week (7 days).


Since there is a time constraint in transitioning objects in S3, you can only change the 
storage class of your objects 
from S3 Standard storage class to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage after 30 days. 
This limitation does not apply to INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER, and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

The following constraints apply from Standard storage class to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA:
	1)not transition objects that are smaller than 128 KB to the STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA.
	2)Objects must be stored for at least 30 days in the current storage class before you can transition them to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA.
	3)(in versioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage.


EBS Encryption at rest:
	using your own keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and
	using Amazon-managed keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

Step scaling applies “step adjustments” which means you can set multiple actions to vary the scaling depending on the size of the alarm breach. When you create a step scaling policy, you can also specify the number of seconds that it takes for a newly launched instance to warm up.



AWS Systems Manager is a useful and powerful tool that allows organizations to operate complex infrastructure at scale, both safely and securely.
AWS Systems Manager provides an operations console and APIs for centralized application and resource management in hybrid environments.

AWS Systems Manager Run Command lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager
You can use Run Command from the AWS console, the AWS Command Line Interface, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs. Run Command is offered at no additional cost.


AWS has an example of the implementation of Quota Monitor CloudFormation template that you can deploy on your AWS account. The template uses an AWS Lambda function that runs once every 24 hours.

The AWS Trusted Advisor Service limit publishes service limits metric to CloudWatch; thus, you can configure an alarm and send a notification to Amazon SNS. You can also create an AWS Lambda function to read data from specific Trusted Advisor checks. A Lambda function invocation can be scheduled using AWS EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to automated the process.



Use ECS as the container management service then set up a combination of Reserved and Spot EC2 Instances for processing mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs respectively.




During peak hours, many employees are experiencing slow connectivity issues:
Associate the VPCs to an Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMR)-enabled transit gateway and attach additional VPN tunnels.
 The maximum tunnel for a VPN connection is two.
 
 
 
 

Upload the data to S3 and set a lifecycle policy to transition data to Glacier after 0 days.

CloudTrail stores the log files to S3 and not in Glacier.
By default, CloudTrail event log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE). 
 You can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically. If you want notifications about log file delivery and validation, you can set up Amazon SNS notifications.
 
 
 
. Amazon strongly recommends that you use two or more HSMs, in separate Availability Zones, in any production CloudHSM Cluster to avoid loss of cryptographic keys



Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer.
Enable access logs on the Application Load Balancer. Integrate the Amazon ECS cluster with Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights to analyze traffic patterns and simplify troubleshooting.




 Amazon FSx Windows File Server can scale out storage to hundreds of petabytes of data with tens of GB/s of throughput performance and millions of IOPS.
 Amazon EFS can only handle Linux workloads.
 
 
 
Kubernetes cluster and have role-based access control (RBAC) access to IAM users and roles for cluster authentication.
single-digit millisecond latency:


Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create node groups in Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster via the AWS Wavelength service. Apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (aws-auth ConfigMap) to your cluster.

AWS Wavelength combines the high bandwidth and ultralow latency of 5G networks with AWS compute and storage services so that developers can innovate and build a new class of applications.


An Amazon EKS connector agent is only used to connect your externally hosted Kubernetes clusters and to allow them to be viewed in your AWS Management Console.
 
 
 : Create a firewall using the AWS Network Firewall service at the VPC level then add custom rule groups for inspecting ingress and egress traffic. Update the necessary VPC route tables.
 firewall must be created at the VPC level and not at the subnet level.
 
 
Add a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group to move instances in the Terminating state to the Terminating:Wait state to delay the termination of unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances. Configure a CloudWatch Events rule for the EC2 Instance-terminate Lifecycle Action Auto Scaling Event with an associated Lambda function. Trigger the CloudWatch agent to push the application logs and then resume the instance termination once all the logs are sent to CloudWatch Logs.\\\


Using CloudWatch agent is the most suitable tool to use to collect the logs. The unified CloudWatch agent enables you to do the following:



dedicated physical server that doesn’t use virtualization,NFS protocol:
Use an AWS Storage Gateway hardware appliance for your compute resources. Configure File Gateway to store the application data and create an Amazon S3 bucket to store a backup of your data.

Among the AWS Storage Gateway storage solutions, only file gateway can store and retrieve objects in 
Amazon S3 using the protocols NFS and SMB.


EFS rapidly changing data and 1000 Linux servers.



There are two options for Volume Gateway iSCSI block :
Cached Volumes – you store volume data in AWS, with a small portion of recently accessed data in the cache on-premises.
Stored Volumes – you store the entire set of volume data on-premises and store periodic point-in-time backups (snapshots) in AWS.

 File Gateway is used to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through NFS and SMB protocols.


By default, IAM users don’t have permission to create or modify Amazon EC2 resources or perform tasks using the Amazon EC2 API. (This means that they also can’t do so using the Amazon EC2 console or CLI.) To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and perform tasks, you must create IAM policies that grant IAM users


EC2DataSendWithInTwoVPC:
Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs.
Re-configure the route table’s target and destination of the instances’ subnet.

VPC endpoints are region-specific only,  do not support inter-region communication.




Create an AMI of the backend application’s EC2 instance. Use the image to set up an Auto Scaling group and configure a target tracking scaling policy based on the ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric.

CPUUtilization metric is not meant for time-sensitive messages where you need to ensure that the messages are processed within a specific time period.
The ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric is useful when applications have time-sensitive messages and you need to ensure that messages are processed within a specific time period. 




due to the volume, most queries take a long time to complete:
Transform the JSON data into Apache Parque format. Ensure that the user has an lakeformation:GetDataAccess IAM permission for underlying data access control.



Create an AWS Auto Scaling policy that scales out the ECS service when the service’s memory utilization is too high.
Create an AWS Auto Scaling policy that scales out the ECS cluster when the cluster’s CPU utilization is too high.

ECS service and ECS container instance based on the metric:

The following metrics are available for instances:
	CPU Utilization
	Disk Reads
	Disk Read Operations
	Disk Writes
	Disk Write Operations
	Network In
	Network Out
	Status Check Failed (Any)
	Status Check Failed (Instance)
	Status Check Failed (System)
The following metrics are available for ECS Service:
	ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization—Average CPU utilization of the service.

	ECSServiceAverageMemoryUtilization—Average memory utilization of the service.

	ALBRequestCountPerTarget—Number of requests completed per target in an Application Load Balancer target group.



By default, data records in Kinesis are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a stream.


In Elastic Beanstalk, where does it store the application files and server log files?
Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs.


CloudFront app Hig availability:The scenario uses an EC2 instance as an origin or CloudFront. 
Provision two EC2 instances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group.
To achieve high availability in an EC2 instance, we need to deploy the instances in two or more Availability Zones. You also need to configure the instances to be part of the origin group to ensure that the application is highly available.

S3 File Gateway presents  NFS and SMB file protocols.
Use an AWS Storage File gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. Send the backups to an SMB share mounted as a local disk.



owner full access to all uploaded objects in the S3 bucket by oterh user:
Create a bucket policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to bucket-owner-full-control.

By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it even though the bucket is owned by another account. To get full access to the object, the object owner must explicitly grant the bucket owner access. You can create a bucket policy to require external users to grant bucket-owner-full-control when uploading objects so the bucket owner can have full access to the objects.



Amazon Pinpoint can send event data to Kinesis Data Firehose, which streams this data to AWS data stores such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. Amazon Pinpoint can also stream data to Kinesis Data Streams, which ingests and stores multiple data streams for processing by analytics applications.

The Amazon Pinpoint event stream includes information about user interactions with applications (apps) that you connect to Amazon Pinpoint. It also includes information about all the messages that you send from campaigns, through any channel, and from journeys. This can also include any custom events that you’ve defined. Finally, it includes information about all the transactional email and SMS messages that you send



With Application Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled.
With Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. After you create the load balancer, you can enable or disable cross-zone load balancing at any time.
When you create a Classic Load Balancer, the default for cross-zone load balancing depends on how you create the load balancer. With the API or CLI, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. With the AWS Management Console, the option to enable cross-zone load balancing is selected by default.


Kinesis Data Streams Slow:
Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream.
To update permormance
Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the UpdateShardCount command.
Splitting increases the number of shards in your stream and therefore increases the data capacity of the stream. Because you are charged on a per-shard basis, splitting increases the cost of your stream. Similarly, merging reduces the number of shards in your stream and therefore decreases the data capacity—and cost—of the stream.




ssh expiring certificates Tow way:
– Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check AWS Health or ACM expiration events related to ACM certificates. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days
– Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule and schedule it to run every day to identify the expiring ACM certificates. Configure to rule to check the DaysToExpiry metric of all ACM certificates in Amazon CloudWatch. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.



On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.
When you create a Capacity Reservation, you specify:

– The Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity

– The number of instances for which to reserve capacity

– The instance attributes, including the instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS
On-Demand instances cannot reserve compute capacity at all. So this option is incorrect.



It is recommended that you launch the number of instances that you need in the placement group in a single launch request and that you use the same instance type for all instances in the placement group.
If you receive a capacity error when launching an instance in a placement group that already has running instances, stop and start all of the instances in the placement group, and try the launch again. Restarting the instances may migrate them to hardware that has capacity for all the requested instances.


AWS Organization allows you to create Service Control Policies (SCPs) that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.

Resuce Cost:
Deploy all the EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone. If you recall, data transferred between Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache instances, and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same Availability Zone is free. Instead of using the public network to transfer the data, you can use the private network to reduce the overall data transfer costs.

Region, they could still be charged with inter-Availability Zone data transfers if the instances are distributed across different availability zones.
you won’t be able to connect to your Amazon S3 bucket if you are using a private subnet unless you have a VPC Endpoint.


Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the --transit-encryption-enabled and --auth-token parameters enabled.



in-flight data between your web servers and RDS should be secured:
Force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL by setting the rds.force_ssl parameter to true. Once done, reboot your DB instance.
Download the Amazon RDS Root CA certificate. Import the certificate to your servers and configure your application to use SSL to encrypt the connection to RDS.


There are 2 ways to use SSL to connect to your SQL Server DB instance:
– Force SSL for all connections.
– Encrypt specific connections.



RDS multiAZL:
– Increased database availability in the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling.

– Provides enhanced database durability in the event of a DB instance component failure or an Availability Zone outage.



RDS synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) that is in the same region and not in a different one.



Amazon Elastic File System=requires a scalable, POSIX-compliant storage service.
“allows concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances”


cross-account access to S3 objects:

– AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and resource-based bucket policies ( for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects

– IAM policies and resource-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects

– Cross-account IAM roles for programmatic and console access to S3 bucket objects.

Not all AWS services support resource-based policies. Therefore, you can use cross-account IAM roles to centralize permission management when providing cross-account access to multiple services.




Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.
The Amazon OpenSearch dashboard is a more suitable service to use than Grafana since the sentiment data is already processed by an Amazon OpenSearch cluster.


To enable the cross-region replication feature in S3, the following items should be met:
	The source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
	The source and destination buckets must be in different AWS Regions.
	Amazon S3 must have permission to replicate objects from that source bucket to the destination bucket on your behalf.




Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Lex. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests.

Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in texts. It is not used to build chatbot applications.



Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.
Amazon Redshift only delivers sub-second response times. 
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), can deliver microsecond response times.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose only supports Amazon S3, 
Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch, and an HTTP endpoint as the destination.


The Cache-Control and Expires headers control how long objects stay in the cache. The Cache-Control max-age directive lets you specify how long (in seconds) you want an object to remain in the cache before CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server. The minimum expiration time CloudFront supports is 0 seconds for web distributions and 3600 seconds for RTMP distributions.


Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account.
By setting up cross-account access in this way, you don’t need to create individual IAM users in each account. In addition, users don’t have to sign out of one account and sign into another in order to access resources that are in different AWS accounts.



Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account.
You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple AISPL accounts. With consolidated billing, you can see a combined view of AWS charges incurred by all of your accounts.


Tag Editor simply allows you to add, edit, and delete tags to multiple AWS resources at once for easier identification and monitoring.



The read replication latency of less than 1 second is only possible if you would use Amazon Aurora replicas. Aurora replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. You can create up to 15 replicas within an AWS Region.
RDS Read Replicas can only provide asynchronous replication in seconds and not in milliseconds.



high-frequency read and write operations handrad of ECS:
ECS to access file system data across your fleet of Amazon ECS tasks.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. 
Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to Max I/O. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

Amazon EFS offers two performance modes:
– General Purpose mode
– Max I/O mode.

There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system:
– Bursting Throughput
– Provisioned Throughput

Bursting Throughput mode won’t be able to sustain the constant demand of the global application. 
Need  Provisioned Throughput mode.


 you cannot directly set a DynamoDB table as a container mount point. In the first place, DynamoDB is a database and not a file system which means that it can’t be “mounted” to a server.
 
 
Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for the AWS Region.
Encryption By Default feature is a Region-specific setting and thus, you can’t enable it to 
selected EBS volumes only.

  EBS encryption:
– Encryption by default is a Region-specific setting. If you enable it for a Region, you cannot disable it for individual volumes or snapshots in that Region.
– When you enable encryption by default, you can launch an instance only if the instance type supports EBS encryption.
– Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs. To encrypt an EBS snapshot, you need to use symmetric CMK.



Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) doesn’t natively work with Amazon S3.
Amazon FSx for Lustre works natively with Amazon S3, a high-performance POSIX interface. 
 


Use AWS Global Accelerator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer from each region to the corresponding endpoint group.
AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances.

With AWS Global Accelerator, you can add or remove endpoints in the AWS Regions, run blue/green deployment, and A/B test without needing to update the IP addresses in your client applications. 
If you have multiple resources in multiple regions, you can use AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the number of IP addresses. 


Enhanced Networking:
	When you need a consistently lower inter-instance latencies.
	When you need a higher packet per second (PPS) performance.
Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking.
. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networkin



By using Docker with Elastic Beanstalk, you have an infrastructure that automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. You can manage your web application in an environment that supports the range of services that are integrated with Elastic Beanstalk, including but not limited to VPC, RDS, and IAM.



In CloudFormation, a template is a JSON or a YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure.
