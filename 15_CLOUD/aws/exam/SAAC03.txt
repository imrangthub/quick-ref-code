and FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.


AWS Data Migration Service:
	AWS Data Migration Service copies data between databases, also send data to Amazon S3, 
	Amazon Kinesis and Apache Kafka.

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it easy to migrate 
relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. 
You can use AWS DMS to migrate your data into the AWS Cloud or between combinations of 
cloud and on-premises setups.


AWS Storage Gateway:
	AWS Storage Gateway provides a virtual storage device that stores data in the cloud 
	(on S3, Glacier, FSx, etc). Think of it as a cloud-backed H: drive with unlimited storage.

AWS Direct Connec:
	AWS Direct Connect links your office or data center to AWS via fiber. It's for high-speed, 
	permanent connectivity to the Cloud.

One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. 
With this connection, you can create virtual interfaces directly to 
public AWS services S3 or to Amazon VPC, bypassing internet service providers in your network path.


AWS Site-to-Site VPN:
	AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a VPN connection between your office/data center and AWS via existing data connections. 
	For example, it can create a VPN connection across your existing Internet fiber connection.

A Site-to-Site VPN connection offers two VPN tunnels between a virtual private gateway or a 
transit gateway on the AWS side, 
and a customer gateway (which represents a VPN device) on the remote (on-premises) side.

=================================================
#Noteable | Example | Topis | Tips | VIP
=================================================


Resilient:
	You can use Aurora replicas and CloudFront distribution to make the application more resilient to spikes in request rates.




Availability:
	If you have workloads that global client base, AWS recommends that you use Global Accelerator. 
	If you have workloads hosted in a single AWS Region and used by clients in and around the same Region, you can use an 
	ALB or NLB to manage your resources.



You can't enable termination protection for Spot Instances.


Network Firewall cannot directly integrate with the Application Load Balancer, it working on VPC.
You can filter network traffic of your VPC using AWS Network Firewall.
AWS WAF straightforward way of integrating with an ALB but not Network Firewall.




AWS CodeDeploy:
	AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed developer tool that is used for rapidly deploying code from a code repository such as 
	GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. 
	You can deploy to many services including AWS services such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. 
	AWS CodeDeploy can be used independently or in a pipeline with AWS CodePipeline.

CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across instances.
CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, 
on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.





VPC Egress-Only  for IPv6 (Outbound traffic only):
	Launch the EC2 instance to a private subnet and attach an Egress-Only 
	Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet. 
	Use AWS Network Firewall to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering.
	
Internet Gateway support both public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address connect to internet.
NAT Gateway is only applicable for IPv4 for Outbound traffic only, not IPv6. 



AWS Proton:
	AWS Proton allows you to deploy any serverless or container-based application with increased efficiency, consistency, and control. 
	You can define infrastructure standards and effective continuous delivery pipelines for your organization. 
	Proton breaks down the infrastructure into environment and service (“infrastructure as code” templates).

AWS Proton allows customers to define application components as a stack, which creates everything needed to provision, 
deploy, and monitor an application, including compute, networking, code pipeline, security, and monitoring. 

AWS Proton associated with:
	Platform Team
	Developers
	Environment Templates
	Service Templates




Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP):
	 The Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is only a Prometheus-compatible monitoring and alerting service that makes it easy 
	 to monitor containerized applications and infrastructure at scale.



Amazon Managed Service for Grafana (AMG):
	Amazon Managed Service for Grafana is a fully managed service with rich, interactive data visualizations to help 
	customers analyze, monitor, and alarm on metrics, logs, and traces across multiple data sources.
	
	
	

Amazon WorkDocs is more often used to easily create, edit, and share documents for collaboration and 
not for serving object data like Amazon S3.
	
 



Ensure that the database is eventually consistent and highly available:
	Configure the Auto Scaling group to spread the Amazon EC2 instances across three Availability Zones. 
	Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with a replication server and an ongoing replication 
	task to migrate the embedded NoSQL database to Amazon DynamoDB.




How ALB prevent SQL injection attacks:
	Use WAF and set up a managed rule to block request patterns associated with the exploitation 
	of SQL databases, like SQL injection attacks. Associate it with the Application Load Balancer. 
	Integrate AWS WAF with AWS Firewall Manager to reuse the rules across all the AWS accounts.




AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all of your VPCs.




Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall can only filter and regulate outbound DNS traffic from your VPC.
	It can neither do active traffic flow inspection nor block any vulnerability exploits.



Redshift(SQL analyse data warehouse) cluster as their data warehouse region outage or down:
	Enable Cross-Region Snapshots Copy in your Amazon Redshift Cluster.



Convert audio recordings into text using Amazon Transcribe. 
	Set up Amazon Translate to translate Hindi texts into English and use Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis.


Process both mission-critical data and non-essential batch jobs:
	Use ECS as the container management service then set up a combination of Reserved and 
	Spot EC2 Instances for processing mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs respectively.
    Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances).




S3 retrieve the required data in under 15 minutes under all circumstances 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput:
	Use Expedited Retrieval to access the financial data.
	Purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.

Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent requests 
for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archives (250 MB+), data accessed 
using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. 

Provisioned capacity ensures that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is available when you need it.




Collect and process the application log files:
	Amazon S3 for storing the application log files and Elastic MapReduce(EMR) for processing the log files.




Fastest storage option with high I/O Performance for the temporary files:
	Configure RAID 0 in multiple instance store volumes.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is just a data storage virtualization technology 
that combines multiple storage devices to achieve higher performance or data durability.
	
This configuration can be implemented on both EBS or InstanceStore volumes. 

RAID 1 configuration is used for data mirroring. 
You need to configure RAID 0 to improve the performance of your storage volumes.




Following resources can be attach to your Transit Gateway:
	– One or more VPCs.
	– One or more VPN connections
	– One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways
	– One or more Transit Gateway Connect attachments
	– One or more Transit gateway peering connections
	


 
RDS if the primary database instance fails:
	The canonical name record (CNAME) is switched from the primary to standby instance.




For Single RDS security use SecurityGroup not Network ACL.
	Network ACL covers the entire subnet which means that other applications that use the same 
	subnet will also be affected.



A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default to a maximum of 8760 hours (365 days).



ASG:
	With Step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that 
	trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a 
	threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods. Step scaling policies 
	increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target based on a set of scaling adjustments, 
	known as step adjustments. 



CloudWatch:
	By default, CloudWatch doesn’t monitor memory usage but only the -
	CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Reads/Writes.

EC2 Detailed Monitoring does not provide metrics for memory usage,
just provides a higher frequency of metrics (1-minute frequency). 




AWS Transfer:
	Create an Amazon S3 bucket with encryption enabled. 
	Launch an AWS Transfer for SFTP endpoint to securely upload files to the S3 bucket. 
	Configure an S3 lifecycle rule to delete files after a month.
	
AWS Transfer Family is a secure transfer service that enables you to transfer files into and out of AWS storage services like S3. 
using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 protocols.



Storage optimized instances:
	Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, 
	sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.

Memory Optimized Instances:
	Memory Optimized Instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process 
	large data sets in memory, which is quite different from handling 
	high read and write capacity on local storage.




EMR(Big Data Frameworks) previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce:
	Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as 
	Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. 
Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out 
of other AWS data stores and databases.




Amazon Redshift is the most widely used cloud data warehouse:
	analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools. 
	It allows you to run complex analytic queries against terabytes to petabytes of 
	structured and semi-structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage 
	on high-performance storage, and massively parallel query execution.



DynamoDB:
	DynamoDB doesn’t fully support the use of standard SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) tools, 
	unlike Amazon Redshift. It also doesn’t allow you to run complex analytic queries against 
	terabytes to petabytes of structured and semi-structured data.




Virtual Desktops:
	First, you need a VPN connection to connect the VPC and your on-premises network. 
	Second, you need AWS Directory Services to integrate with your on-premises Active Directory 
	and lastly, you need to use Amazon WorkSpace to create the needed Virtual Desktops in your VPC.




SAML 2.0:
	Before you can use SAML 2.0-based federation you must configure your organization’s IdP 
	and your AWS account to trust each other. 
	Inside your organization, you must have an IdP that supports SAML 2.0, 
	like Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS, part of Windows Server), Shibboleth, 
	or another SAML 2.0 compatible provider.



DataSync:
	AWS DataSync is primarily used to migrate existing data to Amazon S3. 
	AWS Storage Gateway is more suitable if you still want to retain access to the migrated data 
	and for ongoing updates from your on-premises file-based applications.



Amazon EFS only supports file locking, Object lock is a feature of Amazon S3.



RDS Notification:
	Create a native function or a stored procedure that invokes a Lambda function. 
	Configure the Lambda function to send event notifications to an Amazon SQS queue for the 
	processing system to consume.





AWS Artifact:
	Use AWS Artifact to view the security reports as well as other AWS compliance-related information.
	It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. 
	
Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, 
Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across 
geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of 
AWS security controls. 
Agreements available in AWS Artifact include the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and the 
Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).




Create an Amazon S3 bucket with encryption enabled:
	Launch an AWS Transfer for SFTP endpoint to securely upload files to the S3 bucket. 
	Configure an S3 lifecycle rule to delete files after a month.
There is no retention policy option on AWS Transfer for SFTP.



You can use EventBridge to run ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur.



AWS Control Tower (Multiple AWS accounts):
	AWS Control Tower service is primarily used to manage and govern multiple AWS accounts and not just S3.



ParallelCluster (open-source cluster management tool):
	AWS ParallelCluster is simply an AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy 
	for you to deploy and manage High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS.




Filter policies in SNS (SNS Queue Filter):
	Create one Amazon SNS topic and configure the Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the SNS topic. 
	Set the filter policies in the SNS subscriptions to publish the message to the 
	designated SQS queue based on its quote request type.




AWS Organizations and ADConnector (IAMIdentityCenter):
	On the master account, use AWS Organizations to create a new organization with all features turned on. 
	Invite the child accounts to this new organization.
	Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) for the organization 
	and integrate it with the company’s directory service using the Active Directory Connector
	 
	Amazon Cognito is used for single sign-on in mobile and web applications. 
	You don’t have to use it if you already have an existing Directory Service to be used for authentication.
	 
User->OnPermDirectoryService(MS AD)->ActiveDirectoryConnector(ADTrust)->AWS IAMIdentityCenter(SSO)->access
	->AWSConsole
	->BusinessCloueApp
	->SAMLApplication





DynamoDB and AWS Backup: (backups to another AWS account for disaster recovery):
	Create a DynamoDB gateway endpoint. Associate the endpoint to the appropriate route table. 
	Use AWS Backup to automatically copy the on-demand DynamoDB backups to another AWS account for disaster recovery.

	Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) feature is not capable of restoring a DynamoDB table to a 
	particular point in time in a different AWS account.

DynamoDB on-demand backups cannot be copied to a different account or Region. 
To create backup copies across AWS accounts and Regions and for other advanced features, use AWS Backup.
Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.




Storage Gateway:
	Amazon Storage Gateway is used only for creating a backup of data from your on-premises server 
	and not from the Amazon services.

	Use AWS Storage Gateway to backup the data directly to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
	Snowball Edge can’t directly integrate backups to S3 Glacier.




Roure53 pre-requirment when routing traffic:
	A registered domain name.
	The S3 bucket name must be the same as the domain name.
	No need The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the hosted zone.




Minimize the impact of DDoS attacks:
	Configure Amazon CloudFront distribution and set Application Load Balancer as the origin. 
	Create a rate-based web ACL rule using AWS WAF and associate it with Amazon CloudFront.

By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) for your CloudFront distributions 
or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. 





Department base bill:
	Tag resources with the department name and enable cost allocation tags.




MySQL database needs to replicated in  S3 as CSV files:
	Create a full load and change data capture (CDC) replication task using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). 
	Add a new Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and create an AWS DMS endpoint with SSL.

When using Amazon S3 as a target in an AWS DMS task, both full load and change data capture (CDC) 
data is written to comma-separated value (.csv) format by default.




Snowball:
	AWS Snowball devices can upload the files to  S3. the primary goal is one-time migration of data to AWS 
	which can be accomplished by using AWS Snowball devices.



WorkDocs simply enables you to share content, provide rich feedback, and collaboratively edit documents.



ENI:
	If the instance fails, you (or more likely, the code running on your behalf) can attach 
	the network interface to a another hot standby instance.
 
 
 
 
Detected Unauthorized person using Cameras, security team alerted via SMS:
	Use Amazon Kinesis Video to stream live feeds from the cameras. 
	Use Amazon Rekognition to detect unauthorized personnel. 
	Set the phone numbers of the security as subscribers to an SNS topic.

 
 
 
 
Amazon Fraud Detector:
	Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed service that identifies potentially fraudulent online activities 
	such as online payment fraud and fake account creation.

AWS Trusted Advisor only provides best practice recommendations. It cannot define rules for your AWS resources.





EBS volumes live configuration Change:
	EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production, which means that you can modify 
	the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
	An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance.



 
SQS and Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) services for decoupled architecture in AWS. 




AWS Control Tower:
	AWS Control Tower provides a single location to easily set up your new well-architected multi-account 
	environment and govern your AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and internal compliance.
	
AWS Control Tower provides three methods for creating member accounts:
	– Through the Account Factory console that is part of AWS Service Catalog.
	– Through the Enroll account feature within AWS Control Tower.
	– From your AWS Control Tower landing zone’s management account, using Lambda code 
	  and appropriate IAM roles.

AWS Control Tower automatically implements guardrails using multiple building blocks such as 
AWS CloudFormation to establish a baseline, AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) 
to prevent configuration changes, and AWS Config rules to continuously detect non-conformance.





Systems Manager Parameter:
	Systems Manager Parameter Store doesn’t rotate its parameters by default.
	Use AWS Secrets Manager to store and encrypt the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. 
	Enable automatic rotation for all of the credentials.

KMS is primarily used for encryption and not for hosting your credentials.





SQS (retention period ):
	In Amazon SQS, you can configure the message retention period to a value from 1 minute to 14 days. 
	Default is 4 days. Once the message retention limit is reached, messages are automatically deleted.




Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data. 
Although it can stream data to an S3 bucket, it is not suitable to be used as a queue for a batch application.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, 
and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you are already using today.




RealTime EC2 Log Processing:
	Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream real-time.
	
Kinesis Data Firehose  near RealTime.
Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift(Analytics / BI / Data Warehouse) not RealTime processing.
Redshift is a relational database and best suited for tabular data; Athena is better for semi-structured and unstructured data.	
	




RDS Mysql: increase the disk space without impacting:
	Modify the DB instance settings and enable storage autoscaling.
RDS Storage Auto Scaling automatically scales storage capacity in response to growing database workloads, with zero downtime.




ELB LogProcessing with EMR:
	Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files.
	You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, 
	and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.



The “Trust Relationship” policy simply defines which Principals can Assume the IAM Role and under which conditions.




Error:EC2ThrottledException:
	Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. 
	If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, and  your VPC does not have sufficient ENIs or subnet IPs. 





Route53:
	You can use Route 53 health checking to configure active-active and active-passive failover configurations. 

Active-Active Failover:
	In active-active failover, all the records that have the same name, the same type (such as A or AAAA), and the same routing policy 
	(such as weighted or latency) are active unless Route 53 considers them unhealthy. 
	Route 53 can respond to a DNS query using any healthy record.
	Active-Active Failover no parimary or secondary resource.

Active-Passive Failover:
	Use an active-passive failover configuration when you want a primary resource or group of resources to be available 
	the majority of the time and you want a secondary resource or group of resources to be on standby in case all the 
	primary resources become unavailable.






Aurora  Backup:
	Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily  Aurora snapshots with a retention period of 90 days.
	Maximum backup retention period for Aurora automated backup is only 35 days.



Aurora Instance class to Aurora Serverless:
	Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate a new Aurora Serverless database.
	You can set up a DMS task for either one-time migration or ongoing replication.




AWS and On-Permiss Dedicated connection (With multi AWS acc):
	Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. 
	Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.

VPC peering is not supported in a Direct Connect connection. VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships.
VPN connection traverses the public Internet and doesn’t use a dedicated connection.




By default Network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
By default Security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic, no inbound rules. 




Kinesis Data Streams:
	Collect and process large streams of data records in real-time.
	The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real-time. 
	Consumers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2 or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) 
	can store their results using an AWS service such as  DynamoDB,  Redshift,  S3.


 
AWS Data Exchange is a data marketplace service. 
AWS Data Exchange is on a mission to increase speed to value for third-party data sets in the cloud.
 
 
 
Need to use a service that can store and retrieve objects through standard file storage protocols for quick recovery:
	  Use the AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to store all the backup data in Amazon S3.
	  You cannot directly access the volume gateway using Amazon S3 APIs.
	 
	 
	 
S3:
	Can access S3 buckets file using an S3 URL or through their CloudFront distribution:
	A better solution is to set up an origin access identity (OAI) then use Signed URL or Signed Cookies 
	in your CloudFront web distribution for Restrict access file.

S3 does not public event messages to Amazon MQ. You should use an Amazon SQS instead.

S3 supports 3 destinations where it can publish events:
	1. SNS topic
	2. SQS queue
	3. AWS Lambda
CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) a feature ensures that  CloudFront can serve S3 content.
 





Retrieve a subset of data from a large CSV file stored in an S3: 
	Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object's key.
	
Metadata is not needed when querying subsets of data in an object using S3 Select. 
Tags just provide additional information to your object, not needed when querying with S3 Select although this can be useful 
for S3 Batch Operations. 
 
 
 
 
 
S3 Cross-account Permissions to copy objects from a source bucket in Account A to a destination bucket in Account B:
	– Attach a bucket policy to the source bucket in Account A.
	– Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to a user or role in Account B.
	– Use the IAM user or role in Account B to perform the cross-account copy.
	 
	 
 
Aurora DB cluster:
	A reader endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster provides load-balancing support for read-only connections to the DB cluster.
	Cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster.



Kinesis stream Retation periond(1 to 365):
	A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours (1 day ) by default to a maximum of 8760 hours (365 days).
 
 
 
By default, Fargate tasks are given a minimum of 20 GiB of free ephemeral storage,which meets the storage requirement in the scenario.



Interface endpoint vs Transit Gatewa:
	You pay an hourly rate for every provisioned Interface endpoint.
	AWS Transit Gatewa: VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.




RDS read-replica:
	RDS Replicas asynchronous replication and create read replicas within a Region or between Regions.




Tags:
	All AWS resources be tagged with a standard naming convention:
	Use an AWS Config rule to detect non-compliant tags.
	 



S3 Retrival within 15 minutes under all circumstances:
	If you require access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, you must purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.




ALB SSL MultipleCertificate:
	Upload all SSL certificates of the domains in the ALB using the console and bind multiple certificates to the 
	same secure listener on your load balancer. 
	ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client using Server Name Indication (SNI).

Wildcard certificate can only handle multiple sub-domains but not different domains.
 



S3 decrypted by the Lambda function call:
	Attach the kms:decrypt permission to the Lambda function’s execution role. 
	Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s execution role the kms:decrypt permission.



The /32 denotes one IP address, and the /0 refers to the entire subnet network.



AWS DataSync(moving data between on-premises and AWS storage services like S3,EFS):
	AWS DataSync does not work with Amazon EBS volumes.
	
	DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage,
	AWS Snowcone, S3 buckets,Amazon EFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

 


CloudFormation template:
	Needs to ensure that the required components are properly running before the stack creation proceeds:
	
	Configure a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. 
	Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper script.

UpdatePolicy attribute is primarily used for updating resources and for stack update rollback operations.
UpdateReplacePolicy attribute is primarily used to retain or in some cases, back up the existing physical instance 
of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.



 

Avoid losing recently submitted requests:
	Use an Amazon SQS queue to decouple the application components and scale-out the EC2 instances based upon the 
	SqS ApproximateNumberOfMessages metric in Amazon CloudWatch.



Launch an  Group for each department. 
Create an IAM Policy that enforces MFA authentication with the least privilege permission. 
Attach the IAM Policy to each Group.




SCP:
	SCP can only be attached to the organization root, to an organizational unit (OU), or directly to an account, 
	but not directly in the IAM User. 

	IAM role Cannot directly associate with IAM user.
An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user.
	
Users and Groups use only Policies, You cannot attach Roles to it.

IAM User     = Single Account with credentials for login, e.g. JohnDoe
IAM Role     = Single Account without credentials, created for AWS Resources to "Assume".
IAM Group    = A collection of IAM Users.

IAM Policy   = Resource Access Rules.
Policies are added to Users, Roles, or Groups, to give them the permissions specified in the policy.




You can’t have an Amazon S3 managed encryption key(SSE-S3) for client-side encryption.
	– Set up Client-Side Encryption with a customer master key stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
	– Set up Client-Side Encryption using a client-side master key.




Below are the valid EC2 lifecycle instance states:
	pending – The instance is preparing to enter the running state. 
		An instance enters the pending state when it launches for the first time, or when it is restarted after being in the stopped state.
	running – The instance is running and ready for use.
	stopping – The instance is preparing to be stopped. 
		Take note that you will not billed if it is preparing to stop however, you will still be billed if it is just preparing to hibernate.
	stopped – The instance is shut down and cannot be used. The instance can be restarted at any time.
	shutting-down – The instance is preparing to be terminated.
	terminated – The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be restarted. 
		Take note that Reserved Instances that applied to terminated instances are still billed until the 
		end of their term according to their payment option.

	Enabling DynamoDB Streams to capture table activity and automatically trigger the Lambda function.

CloudWatch Alarms only monitor service metrics, not changes in DynamoDB table data.





SQS:
	Amazon (Default setting)SQS queue no order mentain of message as send or receive and 
	SQS does not guarantee that no duplicates will be sent.
	 
A Kinesis data stream is a set of shards that has a sequence of data records, and each data record has a sequence number 
and guarantee no duplicates.




AWS Data Pipeline:
	AWS Data Pipeline a cloud-based data workflow service that helps you process and move data between different 
	AWS services and on-premises data sources. 

It is not suitable for collecting data from distributed sources such as users, IoT devices, or clickstreams.

Glue is more of a managed ETL service, and Data Pipeline is more of a managed workflow service.



Hundred of EC2 instances Log Process:
	Install the Unified CloudWatch Logs agent in each instance which will automatically collect and push 
	data to CloudWatch Logs. Analyze the log data using CloudWatch Logs Insights.
CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 




S3StaticResourcePublicAcc:
	Grant public read access to the object when uploading it using the S3 Console.
	Configure the S3 bucket policy to set all objects to public read.
	
An IAM Role, in itself, cannot directly make the S3 objects public or change the permissions of each individual object.





Differences between Fault Tolerance and High Availability is that:
	Fault tolarance refers to the minimum number of running instances is .like Need 4 and runing 4
	If Need 4 and runing 2 Its High available.





Dashboard for continuous detection of policy non-conformance and non-compliant 
resources across the enterprise and AWS multi-account strategy best practices ?

AWS Control Tower:
	Use AWS Control Tower to launch a landing zone to automatically provision and configure new accounts through an Account Factory. 
	Utilize the AWS Control Tower dashboard to monitor provisioned accounts across your enterprise. 
	Set up preventive and detective guardrails for policy enforcement.


AWS Control Tower offers a straightforward way to set up and govern an AWS multi-account environment, 
following prescriptive best practices. 

AWS Control Tower orchestrates the capabilities of several other AWS services, including AWS Organizations, AWS Service Catalog, 
and AWS Single Sign-On, to build a landing zone in less than an hour.
 
It offers a dashboard to see provisioned accounts across your enterprise, guardrails enabled for policy enforcement, 
guardrails enabled for continuous detection of policy non-conformance, and non-compliant resources organized by accounts and OUs.

When users perform work in any AWS account in your landing zone, they’re always subject to the guardrails 
that are governing their account’s OU.

The AWS Organizations service neither has the capability to build a landing zone nor a built-in dashboard ,
for continuous detection of policy non-conformance and non-compliant resources across the enterprise.






ElasticBeanstalk environments have limited resources; for example, ElasticBeanstalk does not create a VPC for you.
 
 
 
 
Increase acc time of Websit remove slow ness:
	– Use Amazon CloudFront with website as the custom origin.
	– Use Amazon ElastiCache for the website’s in-memory data store or cache.



Redshift is primarily used for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).
Amazon RDS Read Replica of OLTP (Online Transactional Processing).



NAT gateway:
	You must specify an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway when you create it. 
	The Elastic IP address cannot be changed once you associate it with the NAT Gateway.



Regional Failover and High available:
	In a secondary region, create a global table of the DynamoDB table and replicate, auto-scaling group and application load balancer.
	Use Route 53 DNS failover to automatically route traffic to the resources in the secondary region. 
	Set up the AWS Well-Architected Tool to easily get recommendations for improving your workloads based on the AWS best practices.

A global secondary index can only be created in the region where its parent table resides.
 



 
When you create or update a distribution in CloudFront, you can add an origin access identity (OAI) and automatically update 
the bucket policy to give the origin access identity permission to access your bucket.

Alternatively, you can choose to manually change the bucket policy or change ACLs, which control permissions 
on individual objects in your bucket.
 
 
 



VPNs peering multiple regions:
	To interconnect all of the company’s on-premises networks, VPNs, and VPCs into a single gateway, 
	which includes support for inter-region peering across multiple AWS regions.

	Set up an AWS Transit Gateway in each region to interconnect all networks within it. 
	Then, route traffic between the Transit gateways through a peering connection.

If you attach a transit gateway peering connection, the transit gateway must be in a different Region.




Athena:
	Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in S3 using standard SQL.
	Athena helps you analyze unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data stored in Amazon S3. 
	Examples include CSV, JSON, or columnar data formats such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. 
	You can use Athena to run ad-hoc queries using ANSI SQL without the need to aggregate or load the data into Athena.





RabbitMQ cluster:
	A cluster deployment is a logical grouping of three RabbitMQ broker nodes behind a Network Load Balancer, 
	each sharing users, queues, and a distributed state across multiple Availability Zones (AZ).



DataSync:
	AWS DataSync simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying large amounts of data to and from AWS storage services 
	over the internet or AWS Direct Connect. 
	
You deploy an DataSync agent to on-premises hypervisor or in Amazon EC2. To copy data to or from an on-premises file server.
To set up transfers between Snowcone device and AWS storage, use the DataSync agent AMI that comes pre-installed on your device.




To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you will need to use an AWS Direct Connect service endpoint.
No data transfer cost between S3 and EC2 in the same AWS Region.




LDAP to IAM:
	IAM policy is not enough to integrate your LDAP service to IAM. You need to use SAML, STS, or a custom identity broker.
	
	If your identity store is not compatible with SAML 2.0 then you can build a custom identity broker application 
	to perform a similar function.
	Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application and use STS to issue short-lived AWS credentials.
	


Elastic Fabric Adapter EFA not work for Windows:
	The OS-bypass capabilities of EFAs are not supported on Windows instances. 
	If you attach an EFA to a Windows instance, the instance functions as an Elastic Network Adapter without the added EFA capabilities.




Amazon S3 Anslysis tools:
	S3 Select
		Amazon S3 Select is designed to help analyze and process data within an object in Amazon S3 buckets, faster and cheaper.
	Amazon Athena
		Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL expressions.
		Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL expressions. 
	Amazon Redshift Spectrum
		Redshift also includes Redshift Spectrum, allowing you to directly run SQL queries against exabytes of unstructured 
		data in Amazon S3. No loading or transformation is required, and you can use open data formats, 
		including Avro, CSV, Grok, ORC, Parquet, RCFile, RegexSerDe, SequenceFile, TextFile, and TSV.




Redshift disaster recovery:
	Enable Cross-Region Snapshots Copy in your Amazon Redshift Cluster.
	automated snapshots is not enough and will not be available in case the entire AWS region is down.
	You can configure Amazon Redshift to copy snapshots for a cluster to another region. 
	To configure cross-region snapshot copy, you need to enable this copy feature for each cluster and configure 
	where to copy snapshots and how long to keep copied automated snapshots in the destination region. 

When a cross-region copy is enabled for a cluster, all new manual and automatic snapshots are copied to the specified region.





High I/O performance for the EC2 temporary files:
	Configure RAID 0 in multiple instance store volumes. RAID 1 configuration is used for data mirroring. 




S3 upload encryption obj:
	Create an S3 bucket policy that denies permissions to upload an object unless the request includes 
	the s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256" header. 
	
	Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and rely on the built-in key rotation feature 
	of the SSE-S3 encryption keys.





Deactivating and deleting any IAM user access key that is over 90 days old:
	Amazon EventBridge cannot directly check for IAM events that show the age of IAM access keys.
	
	Use the AWS Config managed rule to check if the IAM user access keys are not rotated within 90 days. 
	Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for the non-compliant keys, and define a target to invoke 
	a custom Lambda function to deactivate and delete the keys.





AWS Health:
	AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts. 
	You can use AWS Health events to learn how service and resource changes might affect your applications running on AWS. 
	
	AWS Health provides relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress. 
	AWS Health also helps you be aware of and to prepare for planned activities.
	
	Use EventBridge to detect and react to AWS Health events. Then, based on the rules that you create, 
	EventBridge invokes one or more target actions. 
	
	
Your account Healt/events page shows all events from the past 90 days.
AWS Service Health Dashboard shows public events that may affect several customers in particular regions. 
It doesn’t show events related to specific EC2 instances on individual AWS accounts.






Comprehend Medical and Textract:
	Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the PDF reports. Integrate Comprehend Medical with the existing Lambda function 
	to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
	
	The PII (Personally Identifiable Information) redaction feature of the Amazon Textract Medical service is not enough to 
	identify all the Protected Health Information (PHI) in the PDF reports. Take note that PII is quite different from PHI.





Max IOPS for volume is 10 GiB (50:1):Set the IOPS to 500 then maintain a low queue length.

	An io1 volume can range in size from 4 GiB to 16 TiB. 
	You can provision from 100 IOPS up to 64,000 IOPS per volume on Nitro system instance families and up to 32,000 on 
	other instance families. The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to the requested volume size (in GiB) is 50:1.
	
	For example, a 100 GiB volume can be provisioned with up to 5,000 IOPS. 
	On a supported instance type, any volume 1,280 GiB in size or greater allows provisioning up to the 64,000 IOPS 
	maximum (50 × 1,280 GiB = 64,000).

The volume queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device.






EBS Multi-attach Not multi AZ:
	Multi-attach feature can only be enabled on EBS Provisioned IOPS io2 or io1 volumes. 
	In addition, multi-attach won’t offer multi-az resiliency because this feature only allows an EBS volume to be attached on 
	multiple instances within a availability zone (AZ).

EBS provides three volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads: 
	General Purpose (SSD), 
	Provisioned IOPS (SSD), 
	and Magnetic.





AWS Config:
	Configure AWS Config to trigger an evaluation that will check the compliance for a user’s password periodically.

AWS Control Tower is used to simplify the creation of new accounts with preconfigured constraints. 
It isn’t used to automate application deployments. Moreover, AWS Config is commonly used for 
monitoring the changes of AWS resources and not the custom resources for serverless or 
container-based applications in AWS.






Enable S3 server access logging:
	Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a S3 bucket.
	
	Track and log every request access to their S3 buckets including the requester, bucket name, request time, request action, 
	referrer, turnaround time, and error code information, Enable server access logging for all required Amazon S3 buckets.

AWS CloudTrail logs provide a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon S3, 
while S3 server access logs provide detailed records for the requests that are made to an S3 bucket.

AWS CloudTrail alone won’t give detailed logging information for object-level access.






Migrate all of its VM workloads to the AWS cloud:
	Install the AWS Replication Agent on each of the on-premises VMs to continuously replicate the servers to AWS. 
	Use AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) to launch test instances and perform cutover once testing is completed.
	
AWS MGN(Application Migration Service)is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS.


The AWS Application Discovery Service is primarily used to track the migration status, 
This service is not capable of doing the actual migration.






Enhanced Monitoring:
	RDS Enhanced Monitoring metrics shown in the Process List:
	RDS Process,RDS child Process,OS Process.

Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU.

RDS provides metrics in real-time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on. 
You can view the metrics for your DB instance using the console or consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output






Where can you safely import the SSL/TLS certificate of your application?
	IAM Certificate store, 
	AWS Certificate Manager.
	
If you got your certificate from a third-party CA, import the certificate into ACM or upload it to the IAM Certificate store.

ACM lets you import third-party certificates from the ACM console, as well as programmatically. 
If ACM is not available in your region, use AWS CLI to upload your third-party certificate to the IAM Certificate store.


Audit Trail for SSE-KMS Key Uses:
	Envelope encryption, Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).

	Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C),Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3): these two do not provide you with an audit trail.



Two AWS services are issuing and deploying X.509 Certificates:
ACM Private CA—
	Certificates issued by a private CA are trusted only within your organization, not on the internet.
	With ACM Private CA, you can create your own CA hierarchy and issue certificates with it for authenticating internal users, 
	computers, applications, services, servers, and other devices and for signing computer code.

ACM Public CA—
	ACM public certificates for enterprise customers who need a publicly trusted secure web presence using TLS. 
	You can deploy ACM certificates into AWS Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, API Gateway, and other integrated services. 
	
	AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you can import certificates that you obtained outside of AWS.
	Multiple certificates with the same domain name can be imported, but they must be imported one at a time.





Secure Connected RDS for MySQ:
	Use IAM DB Authentication and create database accounts using the AWS-provided AWSAuthenticationPlugin plugin in MySQL.

You can authenticate DB instance using IAM database authentication. IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
AWS-provided plugin that works seamlessly with IAM to authenticate your IAM users. 





Allows or blocks web requests:
	A geo match condition lists countries that your requests originate from.

Using AWS WAF: 
	Create a web ACL with a rule that explicitly allows requests from approved IP addresses declared in an IP Set.
	Add another rule  geo match condition that blocks requests that originate from a specific country.
	
If you want to prioritize resources for users in a particular country, you could include a geo-match condition in 
	two different rate-based rules. 
Set a higher rate limit for users in the preferred country and set a lower rate limit for all other users.


If you are using the CloudFront geo restriction feature to block a country from accessing your content, 
any request from that country is blocked and is not forwarded to AWS WAF Classic. 

So if you want to allow or block requests based on geography plus other AWS WAF Classic conditions, 
you should not use the CloudFront geo restriction feature. Instead, you should use an AWS WAF Classic geo match condition.


ALB listener rule, It only determines how the load balancer routes the requests to its registered targets.
You can’t configure a geo match condition in an Application Load Balancer. 







AWS Trusted Advisor:
	AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides real-time guidance and resources best practices. 
	It inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations for saving money, improving system performance and reliability, 
	or closing security gaps.

AWS Cost Explorer:
	AWS Cost Explorer a tool that enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage.
	It has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.





SimpleDB vs DynamoDB:
	SimpleDB is a highly available and scalable NoSQL database, it has a limit on the request capacity or storage size 
	for a given table, unlike DynamoDB.

	DynamoDB is use this to have an ACID-compliant database, it is not capable of handling complex queries and highly 
	transactional (OLTP) workloads.





RDS vs Aurora:
	RDS not scalable to handle the growth of the database. 
	Aurora is the better choice as its underlying storage can grow automatically as needed.




Virtual Desktops:
	VPN connection to connect the VPC and your on-premises network. 
	Second, you need AWS Directory Services to integrate with your on-premises Active Directory and a
	Amazon WorkSpace to create the needed virtual desktops in your VPC.





Enhanced Networking vs ParallelCluster:
	Enable Enhanced Networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on the Windows EC2 Instances.
	Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower 
	inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.
	 
ParallelCluster:
	AWS ParallelCluster is just an AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage 
	High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. 

It not provide higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and lower inter-instance latencies, unlike ENA or EFA.





ALB  health check with HTTP and HTTPS.
NLB and CLB health check with TCP is only.




IAM roles are global:
	Assign the existing IAM role to instances in the new region. IAM roles are global services that are available to all regions.





Block the IP addresses at subnet layer using Network Access Control List (ACLs):
	You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. 
	When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.

Create a Web ACL rule in AWS WAF to block the specified country. Associate this rule to the Application Load Balancers. 






A static Anycast IP address is primarily used by AWS Global Accelerator to enable organizations to route traffic seamlessly 
to multiple regions and improve availability and performance for their end-users.






AppSync:
	AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications. 
	It provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, 
	including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.
	
Develop the application using the AWS AppSync service and use its built-in custom domain feature. 
Associate an SSL certificate to the AWS AppSync API using the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service to enable HTTPS communication.

When you configure an AWS AppSync API, Its provisioned two endpoints:
	AWS AppSync GraphQL endpoint:
	AWS AppSync real-time endpoint:





SQS Short or Long polling:
	The ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds is the queue attribute that determines whether you are using Short or Long polling. 
	By default, its value is zero which means it is using Short polling. 
	If it is set to a value greater than zero, then it is Long polling.
	
The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours in SQS.






Step scaling:
	With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process 
	as well as define how scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods. 

Step scaling policies increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target based on a set of scaling adjustments, 
known as step adjustments. 
 
Scaling up and down multiple times:
	Change the cooldown period of the Auto Scaling group and set the CloudWatch metric to a higher threshold.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Test new version of Application with  50/50 request:
	Use an Application Elastic Load balancer with Weighted Target Groups to divert and proportion the traffic between the 
	on-premises and AWS-hosted application.
	OR
	Use Route 53 with Weighted routing policy to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. 

Network Load balancer doesn’t have Weighted Target Groups.
 
 
 
 
IP addresses from one of the following CIDR blocks:
– 10.0.0.0/8 (RFC 1918)
– 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598)
– 172.16.0.0/12 (RFC 1918)
– 192.168.0.0/16 (RFC 1918)


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heterogeneous migrations a two step process.:
	Heterogeneous database migration in which you need to transform your on-premises Oracle database to PostgreSQL in AWS:
	
	First, use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and application code to match that of the target database, 
	and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database.



 
Route53:
	If you have multiple web servers running on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, 

	Route 53 will route all traffic addressed to your website (e.g. www.tutorialsdojo.com) to the load balancer 
	DNS name (e.g. elbtutorialsdojo123.elb.amazonaws.com).

CNAME records cannot be created for your zone apex. 
You should create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace which is also known as the zone apex. 

For example, if you register the DNS name tutorialsdojo.com, the zone apex is tutorialsdojo.com. 
You can’t create a CNAME record directly for tutorialsdojo.com, but you can create an alias record for tutorialsdojo.com 
that routes traffic to www.tutorialsdojo.com.




Most AWS services use VPC Interface Endpoint, VPC Gateway Endpoint only for S3 and DynamoDB.
  
  
 
AWS Storage Gateway vs DataSync:
	Integrate or replicate the data->AWS Storage Gateway
	Migrate or move data->DataSync 

Set up AWS DataSync to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. 
Launch a new Amazon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. 

Enable AWS CloudTrail with Data Events and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket.

Amazon Storage Gateway:
	File Gateway (NFS/SMB)
	Volume Gateway (iSCSI)
	Tape Gateway (VTL)

A File Gateway is a type of Storage Gateway used to integrate your existing on-premise application with the Amazon S3. 
It provides NFS (Network File System) and SMB (Server Message Block) access to data in S3.


Archive on S3 and frequently accessed data locally on their on-premises server:
Use the Amazon Storage Gateway – Cached Volumes.

Volume Gateway stores and manages on-premises data in Amazon S3  either cache mode or stored mode.
Point-in-time backups of your volumes stored as EBS snapshots and come in two different operational modes: stored and cached.





SQS:
	SQS has automatically deleted the messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period.
	The default message retention period is 4 days max 14 days.





S3 Time Constraint Transitioning:
	Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transition to S3 – Standard IA after 30 days
	Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transition the data from Standard storage class to Glacier after one week (7 days).

Only change the storage class of your objects 
	From S3 Standard storage class to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage after 30 days. 
	This limitation does not apply to INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER, and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

The following constraints apply from Standard storage class to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA:
	1)not transition objects that are smaller than 128 KB to the STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA.
	2)Objects must be stored for at least 30 days in the current storage class before you can transition them to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA.
	3)(in versioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage.





EBS Encryption at rest:
	using your own keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and using Amazon-managed keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).




Step scaling:
	Step scaling applies “step adjustments” which means you can set multiple actions to vary the scaling 
	depending on the size of the alarm breach. 
	
When you create a step scaling policy, you can also specify the number of seconds that it takes for a newly launched instance to warm up.






AWS Systems Manager Run Command:
	AWS Systems Manager is a useful and powerful tool that allows organizations to operate complex infrastructure at scale, 
	both safely and securely.

	Systems Manager provides an operations console and APIs for centralized application and resource management in hybrid environments.

	AWS Systems Manager Run Command lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. 
	A managed instance is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been 
	configured for Systems Manager.

You can use Run Command from the AWS console, the AWS Command Line Interface, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs. 
Run Command is offered at no additional cost.



 
AWS has an example of the implementation of Quota Monitor CloudFormation template that you can deploy on your AWS account. 
The template uses an AWS Lambda function that runs once every 24 hours.





Trusted Advisor:
	The AWS Trusted Advisor Service limit publishes service limits metric to CloudWatch; 
	thus, you can configure an alarm and send a notification to Amazon SNS. 

You can also create an AWS Lambda function to read data from specific Trusted Advisor checks. 
A Lambda function invocation can be scheduled using AWS EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to automated the process.




Use ECS as the container management service then set up a combination of Reserved and Spot EC2 Instances for processing 
mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs respectively.




During peak hours, many employees are experiencing slow connectivity issues:
	Associate the VPCs to an Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMR)-enabled Transit gateway and attach additional VPN tunnels.
	The maximum tunnel for a VPN connection is 2-two.
	 
	 
 
 



CloudTrail log processing:
	CloudTrail stores the log files to S3 and not in Glacier.
	By default, CloudTrail event log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3). 

You can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically. 
If you want notifications about log file delivery and validation, you can set up Amazon SNS notifications.


 
 
CloudHSM:
	Amazon strongly recommends that you use two or more HSMs, in separate Availability Zones, 
	in any production CloudHSM Cluster to avoid loss of cryptographic keys.





Access logs on the Application Load Balancer:
	Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer.
	Enable access logs on the Application Load Balancer. 

Integrate the ECS cluster with Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights to analyze traffic patterns and simplify troubleshooting.





Amazon FSx Windows File Server can scale out storage to hundreds of petabytes of data with tens of GB/s of throughput performance 
and millions of IOPS. 
Amazon EFS can only handle Linux workloads.





EKS cluster authentication:
	Kubernetes cluster and have role-based access control (RBAC) access to IAM users and roles for cluster authentication.
	single-digit millisecond latency:

Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. 
Create node groups in Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster via the AWS Wavelength service. 
Apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (aws-auth ConfigMap) to your cluster.

AWS Wavelength:
	AWS Wavelength combines the high bandwidth and ultralow latency of 5G networks with AWS compute and storage services 
	so that developers can innovate and build a new class of applications.

An Amazon EKS connector agent is only used to connect your externally hosted Kubernetes clusters and to allow them to be 
viewed in your AWS Management Console.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Network Firewall:
	Create a firewall using the AWS Network Firewall service at the VPC level then add custom rule groups for inspecting 
	ingress and egress traffic. Update the necessary VPC route tables.
	
Firewall must be created at the VPC level and not at the subnet level.
Network ACLs to control access to your subnets.
Security group for your EC2.	 
 
 
 
 
EC2 Terminating log save:
	Add a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group to move instances in the Terminating state to the Terminating:Wait state 
	to delay the termination of unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances. 
	
Configure a CloudWatch Events rule for the EC2 Instance-terminate Lifecycle Action Auto Scaling Event with an associated Lambda. 
Trigger the CloudWatch agent to push the application logs and then resume the instance termination once all the logs are sent 
to CloudWatch Logs.





To collect logs from your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers into CloudWatch Logs, AWS offers two options:
	Recommended – The unified CloudWatch agent.
	Supported, but deprecation – The older CloudWatch Logs agent(only Linux servers ).
	
Using  CloudWatch agent to collect metrics and logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers.
Unified CloudWatch agent enables you to: 
	Collect internal system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems also EC2 logs.
	
CloudWatch Agent enables you to collect and export host-level metrics and logs on instances running Linux or Windows server.





Dedicated physical server that doesn’t use virtualization,NFS protocol:
	Use an AWS Storage Gateway hardware appliance for your compute resources. 
	Configure File Gateway to store the application data and create an S3 bucket to store a backup of your data.

Among the AWS Storage Gateway storage solutions, only File Gateway can store and retrieve objects in S3 using the protocols NFS and SMB.

File Gateway is used to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through NFS and SMB protocols.

EFS for rapidly changing data and 1000 Linux servers.






There are two options for Volume Gateway iSCSI block :
	Cached Volumes – you store volume data in AWS, with a small portion of recently accessed data in the cache on-premises.
	Stored Volumes – you store the entire set of volume data on-premises and store periodic point-in-time backups (snapshots) in AWS.




By default, IAM users don’t have permission to create or modify Amazon EC2 resources or perform tasks using the EC2 API. 
(This means that they also can’t do so using the Amazon EC2 console or CLI.)
To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and perform tasks, you must create IAM policies that grant IAM users.






Messages are processed within a specific time period:
	Use a AMI to set up an Auto Scaling group and configure a target tracking scaling policy based on the
	SQS ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric.

The ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric is useful when applications have time-sensitive messages and you need to ensure 
that messages are processed within a specific time period. 





Due to S3 data volume, most queries take a long time to complete:
	Transform the JSON data into Apache Parque format. 
	Ensure that the user has an lakeformation:GetDataAccess IAM permission for underlying data access control.





ECS service’s memory and CPU utilization:
	Create an AWS Auto Scaling policy that scales out the ECS service when the service’s memory utilization is too high.
	Create an AWS Auto Scaling policy that scales out the ECS cluster when the cluster’s CPU utilization is too high.

ECS service and ECS container instance  metric are:

ECS Container Instances Metric:
	CPU Utilization
	Disk Reads
	Disk Read Operations
	Disk Writes
	Disk Write Operations
	Network In
	Network Out
	Status Check Failed (Any)
	Status Check Failed (Instance)

ECS Service Metric:
	ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization—Average CPU utilization of the service.
	ECSServiceAverageMemoryUtilization—Average memory utilization of the service.
	
	
	
	
ALBRequestCountPerTarget—Number of requests completed per target in an Application Load Balancer target group.
By default, data records in Kinesis are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a stream.




ElasticBeanstalk, where does it store the application files and server log files?
	Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs.



CloudFront app Hig availability:The scenario uses an EC2 instance as an origin or CloudFront. 
	Provision two EC2 instances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group.
To achieve high availability in an EC2 instance, we need to deploy the instances in two or more Availability Zones. 
You also need to configure the instances to be part of the origin group to ensure that the application is highly available.




S3 File Gateway presents  NFS and SMB protocols.
	Use an AWS Storage File gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. 
	Send the backups to an SMB share mounted as a local disk.

Owner full access to all uploaded objects in the S3 bucket by oterh user:
	Create a bucket policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to bucket-owner-full-control.





Amazon Pinpoint:
	Pinpoint is a flexible, scalable marketing communications service that connects you with customers over email, SMS, 
	push notifications, or voice.
	Amazon Pinpoint can send event data to Kinesis Data Firehose, which streams this data to AWS data stores such as 
	Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. 
	Amazon Pinpoint can also stream data to Kinesis Data Streams, which ingests and stores multiple data streams 
	for processing by analytics applications.

	The Amazon Pinpoint event stream includes information about user interactions with applications (apps) that you connect to 
	Amazon Pinpoint. 
	
It also includes information about all the messages that you send from campaigns, through any channel, and from journeys. 
This can also include any custom events that you’ve defined. 
Finally, it includes information about all the transactional email and SMS messages that you send.




With Application Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled.
With Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. 

After you create the load balancer, you can enable or disable cross-zone load balancing at any time.

When you create a Classic Load Balancer, the default for cross-zone load balancing depends on how you create the load balancer. 
With the API or CLI, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. 
With the AWS Management Console, the option to enable cross-zone load balancing is selected by default.






On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. 
This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently from the billing discounts offered 
by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.

When you create a Capacity Reservation, you specify:
	– The AvailabilityZone in which to reserve the capacity
	– The number of instances for which to reserve capacity
	– The instance attributes, including the instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS
 
On-Demand instances cannot reserve compute capacity at all.




Capacity error placement group :
	It is recommended that you launch the number of instances that you need in the placement group in a single launch request 
	and that you use the same instance type for all instances in the placement group.

	If you receive a capacity error when launching an instance in a placement group that already has running instances, 
	stop and start all of the instances in the placement group, and try the launch again. 

Restarting the instances may migrate them to hardware that has capacity for all the requested instances.





AWS Organization allows you to create SCPs that centrally control AWS service across multiple AWS accounts.





Reduce Cost:
	Deploy all the EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone. If you recall, data transferred between 
	EC2,  RDS,  Redshift,  ElastiCache instances, and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same Availability Zone is free. 

Instead of using the public network to transfer the data, you can use the private network to reduce the overall data transfer costs.

Could be charged with inter-Availability Zone data transfers if the instances are distributed across 
different availability zones.


You won’t be able to connect to your Amazon S3 bucket if you are using a private subnet unless you have a VPC Endpoint.
Private subnet connect S3 using vpc Endpoint.






Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the 
	--transit-encryption-enabled and --auth-token parameters enabled.




In-flight data between your web servers and RDS should be secured:
	Force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL by setting the rds.force_ssl parameter to true. 
	Once done, reboot your DB instance.
	
	Download the Amazon RDS Root CA certificate. Import the certificate to your servers and configure your application to 
	use SSL to encrypt the connection to RDS.

There are 2 ways to use SSL to connect to your SQL Server DB instance:
	– Force SSL for all connections.
	– Encrypt specific connections.





A Service that Automated the creation of EBS snapshot on Regular basis = (DLM) Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager.

RDS multiAZL:
– Increased database availability in the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling.
– Provides enhanced database durability in the event of a DB instance component failure or an Availability Zone outage.

RDS synchronously replicates within same regin:
	RDS synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) that is in the same region.

By using cross-Region read replicas in Amazon RDS, you can create 
MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server read replica in a different Region. (asynchronous replication)






Cross-account access to S3 objects:
	– IAM policies and resource-based bucket policies             for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects.
	– IAM policies and resource-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects.
	– Cross-account IAM roles                                     for programmatic and console access to S3 bucket objects.

Not all AWS services support resource-based policies. 
Therefore, you can use cross-account IAM roles to centralize permission management when providing cross-account access 
to multiple services.





OpenSearch:
	Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. 
	Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.

The Amazon OpenSearch dashboard is a more suitable service to use than Grafana since the sentiment data is already processed 
by an Amazon OpenSearch cluster.





To enable the cross-region replication feature in S3, the following items should be met:
	The source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled and must be in different AWS Regions.
	Amazon S3 must have permission to replicate objects from that source bucket to the destination bucket on your behalf.





Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Lex. 
Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions 
based on user requests.

Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in texts. 
It is not used to build chatbot applications.





Ingest/Consume the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Amazon Redshift only  sub-second response times. 
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), microsecond response times.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose only supports  S3,  Redshift,  Elasticsearch, and an HTTP endpoint as the destination.






CloudFront Cache-Control:
	The Cache-Control and Expires headers control how long objects stay in the cache. 
	The Cache-Control max-age directive lets you specify how long (in seconds) you want an object to remain in the cache before 
	CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server. 

The minimum expiration time CloudFront supports is 0 seconds for web distributions and 3600 seconds (1Hr) for RTMP distributions.






Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account.
By setting up cross-account access in this way, you don’t need to create individual IAM users in each account. 

In addition, users don’t have to sign out of one account and sign into another in order to access resources that are 
in different AWS accounts.





AWS Consolidated Billing:
	Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account.

You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts or
multiple AISPL accounts. 
With consolidated billing, you can see a combined view of AWS charges incurred by all of your accounts.


Tag Editor simply allows you to add, edit, and delete tags to multiple AWS resources at once for easier identification and monitoring.






Amazon Aurora replicas vs RDS replicas:
	The read replication latency of less than 1 second is only possible if you would use Amazon Aurora replicas.

Aurora replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. 
You can create up to 15 replicas within an AWS Region.

RDS Read Replicas can only provide asynchronous replication in seconds and not in milliseconds.




High-frequency read and write operations handrad of ECS:
	ECS to access file system data across your fleet of Amazon ECS tasks.
	Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. 
	Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to Max I/O. 
	
	Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

EFS offers two performance modes:
	– General Purpose mode
	– Max I/O mode.
	
There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system:
	– Bursting Throughput
	– Provisioned Throughput

Bursting Throughput mode won’t be able to sustain the constant demand of the global application. 
Need  Provisioned Throughput mode.
	
Cannot directly set a DynamoDB table as a container mount point:
	In the first place, DynamoDB is a database and not a file system which means that it can’t be “mounted” to a server.
 
 
 
 
 
Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for the AWS Region.
	Encryption By Default feature is a Region-specific setting and thus, you can’t enable it to selected EBS volumes only.

EBS encryption:
	– Encryption by default is a Region-specific setting. If you enable it for a Region, you cannot disable it for individual 
      volumes or snapshots in that Region.
	
	– When you enable encryption by default, you can launch an instance only if the instance type supports EBS encryption.
	– Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs. To encrypt an EBS snapshot, you need to use symmetric CMK.

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) doesn’t natively work with Amazon S3.
Amazon FSx for Lustre works natively with Amazon S3, a high-performance POSIX interface. 


AWS File Gateway lets you store local files as objects in an S3 bucket, creating an S3 storage gateway.
File gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.






Global Accelerator:
User->AWSEdgeNet->GlobalAcc->NLB/ALB/EC2

	Use AWS Global Accelerator create an endpoint with static IP for User and connect each AWS Region, then 
	Associate the Elastic Load Balancer from each region.
	
AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. 
It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, 
such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances.

With AWS Global Accelerator, you can add or remove endpoints in the AWS Regions, run blue/green deployment, and A/B test 
without needing to update the IP addresses in your client applications. 

If you have multiple resources in multiple regions, you can use AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the number of IP addresses. 





Enhanced Networking:
	EC2 provides enhanced networking capabilities through the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA). 
	To use enhanced networking, you must install the required ENA module and enable ENA support.

	When you need a consistently lower inter-instance latencies.
	When you need a higher packet per second (PPS) performance and single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).





CloudFormation, a template:
In CloudFormation, a template is a JSON or a YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure:
	– Format Version
	– Description
	– Metadata
	– Parameters
	– Mappings
	– Conditions
	– Transform
	– Resources (required)
	– Outputs

Amazon EBS offers three types of Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes:
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Block Express volumes
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes

IO2 volumes can deliver maximum of 500 IOPS per 1 GB where as IO1 volumes can deliver maximum of 50 IOPS per 1GB.
	io1 volume 1,280 GiB in size or greater (50 × 1,280 GiB = 64,000 IOPS)
	io2 volume 128 GiB in size or greater (500 × 128 GiB = 64,000 IOPS)
	
	50:1 for io1
	500:1 for io2
	
i2 instances=>deliver 350,000 random read IOPS and 320,000 random write IOPS.
i3 instances=>can deliver up to 3.3 million IOPS at a 4 KB block and up to 16 GB/second of sequential disk throughput.


	 
EBS Multi-attach only be enable on EBS Provisioned IOPS io1/io2 volumes not General purpose SSD.
EBS Multi-attach won’t offer Multi-AZ resiliency, this only allow EBS volume to be attached on Multiple intance within a single AZ.
 

AMI are categorized two type storage backed by(Store-Backed AMI):
	1) EBS.
	2) Instance Store.
	
AMI with EBS volume, created from an Amazon EBS Snapshot.
AMI is and Instance-Store volume, created from and template stored in Amazon S3.
	
Data of Instance store volumes persist only dureing the life of the instance.


EC2 instances support two types for block level storage: 
	EC2 Instances can be launched using either EBS or Instance Store volume as root volumes and additional volumes.

EC2 instances can be launched by choosing between AMIs backed by EC2 instance store and AMIs backed by EBS.

Key points for Instance store backed Instance
	Boot time is slower then EBS backed volumes and usually less then 5 min.

EBS lessthen 1 minute.	
InstanceStore:
Lessthen 5 minute.
	There are three types of instance store volumes: ephemeral, non-volatile memory (NVMe) SSD, and TRIM

	



Network load balancer support Layer 4 traffic, and TCP,UDP,TLS protocol, ALB not support UDP.



Restart EC2 for error:
	 Look at CloudWatch logs for keywork or error, create a custom metric.
	 Then Create a CloudWatch alarm for that custom metric which invokes an action to restart the EC2.
You can create alarms that auto stop,terminate,reboot or recover EC2 instance using CloudWatch alarms action.

Flow logs are using VPC, not on specific EC2 instance.






AWS Server-Side Encryption:
	SSE-S3			=> Auto key rotates, No Audit trails show.
	SSE-KMS(CMKs)   => Auto key rotates, Protecton access, Audit trails show.
	SSE-C           => Auto key rotates, No Audit trails show.

	First One: AWS ACM built-in certificate expiration event,which is raised throw Amazon EventBridge, to invoke a Lambda function.
	The funcation now can send notification using SQS or Security hub.
	
	Second one: Recent Lunch DaysToExpiry metric to schedule a batch search to expiring certificats and to log all finding.
	And Send Notification on SQS.
	
CloudWatch Event are truned into action using Amazon Eventbridge.
AWS health event are generated for ACM certificates that are eligibnle for renwwal.

EventProducer=>Event=>EventBridge=>rule=>ActionOnAWSServices(Lambda, Kisinsis, SQS)

AWS Ceritficate manager automatically generated AWS Health events. manually crateing a custom AWS Config rule to check
for SSL exprie is unnecessary. 
also AWS Config already provide a built-in acm-certiticate-expriration-check manage rule that can used, not need manually cration.






AutoScaling provides scaling plans for : EC2, SpotFleets,ECS Tasks (ECS Services or ECS Containers Instance), 
										 DynamoDB table and Index, Aurora Replics.
ECS Instance metrics:
	CPU Utilization
	DiskRead/Writes
	Network In/Out etc.
	
ECS Services metrics:
	ECSServiceAvaragesCPUUtilization
	ECSServicAvarageMemoryUtilization
	ALBRequestCoountPerTarget
	
AutoScaling not support any metrics from ALB.






RDS Mult-AZ deployment provide enhanced availability and durability for DB instance.
In case of Infrastructure failure or AZ fail:
	RDS perform an automatic failover to the standby Instance(Read Replica for Aurora. Endpoint remains same after failover.

RDS synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in different AZ in same region not in a different region.





HPC, Natively workign with S3, POSIX interface=>FSx for Luster.
EFS, EBS, FSx for Windows: Not working with S3 easy way.

EFS=>NFS/SMB
FSx for Win=>SMB






AWS resource access share to different AWS account using cross-account acccess.
No need individual IAM user in each account.

AWS Organization Consolidate bill feature allow payment for multiple aws account or multiple AISPL acc.
Its for combined view of aws charge all account also get cost report for each member.

AWS Trusted advisor is an provides real-time guidance for best practices. Its not assist in maintaining goverence
over  AWS account.






Company Need to resuce IP address that need to regularly whitelist on corporate firewal:
	Use AWS Global Acclerator and Create and endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the ALB for each region to 
	the corresponding endpoin group.

Global Acclerator inporove application availabilithy and performance for local or global user.
It provide static IP that act as a fixed entry point to application endpoint in a single or multiple AWS Region
which application may backend by ALB,NLB or EC2.

For multiple resources in multiple region, use AWS Global Acclerator to reduce the number of IP address.
By Creating and endpoint group, you can add all of EC2 from a single region in that group.

No multiple endpoint for all the available AWS Region, better create one endpoint group for all region.

If multiple region rsourc then not use ALB for route traffic to multiple region Instead use AWS Global Acclearator.






Inspect Traffic In/Out of VPC: Use Network Firewall and add custom rule groups for inspecting traffic.

Only Traffic Mirroring filters can not inspect the actual packet within traffic, Its just copy network traffic
From and ENI.






Multiple Site-to-Site VPN connection slow for VPC and remote Network suring peak hours:
	Associate VPCs to and Equal Cost Multipath Routing ECMR-enable TransitGateway and attach additional VPN tunnels.
AWS transit Gateway enable you to scale the IPsec VPN throughput with equal-cost multi-pah ECMP routing support over 
multple VPN Tunnels.

A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection 
that can be attached to a single VPC at a time.

At a time A VPC can only have a single virtual private gateway attached to it, No multiple VPG not allow. 1 VPC = 1VPG
Maximum tunnel for a VPC connection is two by limit.


 
 



Amazon web services have mainly two dedicated managed services for workflow implementation.
	Simple Workflow Service (SWF)
	Step Functions


Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.
Amazon SWF, on the other hand, is a cloud-based service, allows common programming languages to be used, and lets developers 
control where tasks are processed.

A task is an invocation of a logical step in an Amazon SWF application. Amazon SWF interacts with workers which are programs 
that retrieve, process, and return tasks.


AWS Step Functions is a visual workflow service that helps developers use AWS services to build distributed applications, 
automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning (ML) pipelines.
Your workflow can be visualized by state machines describing steps, their relationships, and their inputs and outputs.

Step Functions is a managed service, so users don't have to deploy or maintain any infrastructure for either the workflow management 
or the tasks themselves. 

SWF also manages workflow state in the cloud. However, unlike Step Functions, a user has to manage the infrastructure 
that runs the workflow logic and tasks.





VPC Inter-region private communication (VPC peering):
	Setup a VPC peering connection between VPCs.
	Re-config the route table targete and destination of the instance subnet.
	
VPC endpoint not needed becos VPCEndpoint are region specific only. Not support inter-region communicaton.

In VPC peering enables route traffic between them using private IPv4 or IPv6 like there in a single private network.
VPC peering cand own VPC, other account VPC, VPC can be different region.
Inter-region vpc peering encryps traffic, never travel public network.





Config DNS zone apex record to point load balancer:
	Create and A record aliesed to the load balancer DNS name.

Use and Alias record pointing to the DNS name of Loadbalancer not IP, since the IP address of the Load balancer can change at any time.

CNAME record cannot be creaed for your zone apex, create alies record at the top node of DNS as zone apex.





Track AWS resources uses for quotas unexpectdly:
	Writge and Lambda function that refreshs tha AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits checks and set it to run every 24 houts.
	Capture the events using Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Event) and use an SNS topic as the target for notifications.
	
	
AWS Trusted Advisor provide best practices from hundreds of thousands of AWS customer.
Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment make recommendatins for save money, inprove system availability, security Gap.

AWS has and example of the implemenation of Quota Monitoring CloudFormaton template that cand deploy on AWS account.
The Template uses a Lambda funcaton that runs onece every 24 hour and refresh Trusted advisor service Limits check quota throw API call.
CloudWatch event capture the status events from Trusted advisor, send status to targets SQS, SNS, lambda for Slack notification.
Trusted advisor services limit publish services limit metric to CloudWatch, config alarm and send notification to SNS or Lembda.

Trusted dAdvisor APIs are only available for Business, Enterprise On-Ramp or Support plans. (DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks API)
Its Return all avalilable Trusted advisor check info, so its will be dificult to extract only "service limits" info from thsi api.






From S3 to Standard IA and OneZone IA need to stay data in current class more 30 days, not for Intelligence,Glacier or DepArch.
For surprice check for audit then need to with in 1 minute then use Glaicer. (S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval)Ite  provide quick acc (1-5mm).
Deep Archive need several hours.

If you dont know the acccess time schedule or frequently change then use Intelligence class for save cost.

S3 proivides 3500(PUT) request per second to add data and 5500 read data (GET) default. Per prefix.
For parallel permormance to scale more request use prefix, S3 scale performance per prix.






Encrypted at rest, full control over the encryption key, immedit remove material from the AWS KMS, audit using CloudTrails:
	use Aws key Management Service to Create a CMK in a custom key store and store the non-extractable key material in CloudHSM.

A Custom key (KMS) store CloudHSM. For immeditely remove the key meterial from AWS KMS use a custom key Store.

Use Custom key Store (CloudHSM) for:
	Direct control.
	Immediatly remove key metatial from KMS and independently.
	Audit all use of keys independently from of KMS and CloudTrail.
	
AWS-owned CMK and AWS-manageed CMK are manage by AWS.





Many Employee need to granted to a S3 for there personal document:
	Config and IAM role and IAM Policy to access S3 Bucket.
	Setup a Federation proxy or and Identity provider and use AWS Security Token Service to generate Temp Token.
	
	
	


Prevent S3 photo link used by other company:
	Remove S3 public read access and use pre-signed URLs with expriy dates.
	




Prevent backend system from traffic spikes:
	Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provide throttling (rate limit 1000 request per second), and caching to API call by TTL also invalid the cache.

	
	
	
	

A logging system for all change made to AWS resource in all Region also provide and event history of api calls in MConsole and CLI:
	Setup CloudTrail trail in S3 using cli and pass --is-multi-region-trail and --include-global-service-event parameter.
	With KMS encryption MFA and bucket policy.
Not CloudWatch use CloudTrails.


CloudTrails record all activity of and account by MConsole, SDK,CLI and other AWS Services by user,role and services.
ClousTrails trails all region by default when create trail using MConsole, but in CLI need to pass parameter  --is-multi-region-trail.

By Default CloudTrails cover the activities of regional services(EC2,S3,RDS etc) not for global services.
For Global services (IAM CloudFront,WAF, Route53) in CLI mode add parameter --include-global-service-event parameter.







Aurora Custome endpoint:
	A Custome endpoint For different purpose (Read Only or read-write ) you can map each connect to a specific instance or a 
	Group of Instance.Base on usecase, of your requirment.

Aurora Cluster endpoint (also call writer endpoint) made from primary DB instance what is best for product traffic not for Repoting.
Use Custome endpoint for Repoting.

Create a custome endpoint in Aurora base on the specified criteria for product traffic and another custome end point for repoting.
Aurora involved a cluster of DB Instance not single instance. Each conn is handled by specific DB Instance.





Availabel in case of Oracle Database failure in future: 
	Create Oracle database in RDS with Multi-AZ deployment.

Oracle RMAN and RAC are not supported in RDS.






Linux and Windows EC2 monitor for memory and disk Utilization metrics:
	Install CloudWatch agent to all EC2, View the custome metrics in CloudWatch console.
	
Enhanced Monitoring is a feature of RDS and By Default stored metrics for 30 days in CloudWatch logs.
And 
Detailed Monitoring for EC2. Detailed monitoring delivers metrics in 1-minute intervals, rather than 5-minute intervals.	







Handel Unpredictable transactional workload and autoscales capacity and peak load scales DB:
	Lunch and Autora Serverless DB cluster then set the minumum and maximum capacity for the cluster.
	
Aurora Serverless is and on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Aurora.
Non-Serverless DB cluster of Autora called provisioned DB Cluster.

Both Provision DB and Serverless carry same of feature like: scale, permormance dustributed all two are same.

But Provisioning DB cluster for where you can predicatable workload and you cand adjust the capacity manually base on workload.
Where Serverless for un-predicatable workload.

	
	
	
	

Both historical record and frequently data are store on on-permises storage system what is going low capacity 
	Need to move Historical data:
	Use AWS DataSync to move historical data to AWS, choose S3Glacier Deep Archive to destination.

Storage Gateway mainly prividing low-latency access to data by caching frequently acc data on-premises and Archive data on Cloud Storage.
Storage Gateway optimizes data transfer to AWS by sending only change data and compressing data.





What needs outside of VPC for site-to-site VPN Conn:
	An Inter-routeable IP(Public IP/Static) of the customer gateway external interface for on-permises network.
	
Required For communication with own network using VPN:
	Attach a VPG virtual private gateway to VPC
	Create a custom route table
	Update SecurityGroup
	A public IP on-permises side
	A Customer Gateway on on-permise side(physical or software)

	
IPv6 not support by EC2 classic.

Fault tolerance for DirectConnectConnection to VPC:
	Establish a hardware VPN over Internet bwtween VPC and on-permises.
	Establish another DirectConnectConnection and Private Virtual Interface in same AWS region as VPC1.
	
CustomerNetwork=>DirectConnectConnection=>VIF=>DirectConnectGateway=>VGW=>VPC.

A virtual interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, either public or private. 
	A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3. 
	A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC.
	
	
	





A large portion of traffice from Philipnd and Indai will be route to resourde ap-northest-1 region:
	Use Reoute53 Geoproximity Routing.
	
Route53 Routing:
	Latency Routing:      Provide lowest latenct for resources, not guarantee user and resource will be same location.
	Geoproximity Routing: Route traffic using user and resource GeoLocation also with a Bias value for more/less traffic to a resource.
	Geolocation Routing:  GeoLocation of user base routing. Serve resource from the DNS queres origin from.
	Weighted Routing:     Multi resource associat with single domain name and set how much traffic to go each resource by percentage %.
	
	

Publish events when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted:
	Create a SNS topic and SQS. add and S3 Event notification confg on bucket to publish S3:ObjectCreated:* and 
	S3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event type to SQS and SNS.
	
s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event for send nofification for version/non version permanently deleted.
ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated: a new version created.

S3 can publish notifications for the following events:
	1. New object created events
	2. Object removal events
	3. Restore object events
	4. Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost events
	5. Replication events

S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:
	1. SNS topic
	2. SQS queue
	3. Lambda
S3 does support Amazon MQ as a destination to publish events.

To avoid loging loop, use two buckets, or configure the trigger to only apply to a prefix used for incoming objects.




S3 protecting data at rest:
	Server-Side Encryption – You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and 
	decrypt it when you download the objects.
		Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
		Use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
		Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
		
	Client-Side Encryption – You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. 
	In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.
		Use Client-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Customer Master Key (CMK)
		Use Client-Side Encryption Using a Client-Side Master Key

SSE-S3 is S3 managed key is fully managed by AWS and also rotates the key automatically and 
Customer master key (CMK) in AWS KMS that you can manage, rotate, and audit or alternatively, use a client-side master key 
that you manually maintain.








Concerned about the over-provisioning of the resources by ASG:
	Use target tracking scaling.
	
With a target tracking scaling policy, you can increase or decrease the current capacity of the group based on a 
target value for a specific metric. This policy will help resolve the over-provisioning of your resources.
	

Simple scaling: 
	Need to wait for the cooldown period to complete before initiating additional scaling activities. 
	
Target tracking or step scaling policies can trigger a scaling activity immediately without waiting for the 
cooldown period to expire.

Scheduled scalingis: 
	Mainly used for predictable traffic patterns. You need to use the target tracking scaling policy to optimize the 
	cost of your infrastructure without affecting the performance.






For Role-based access control. Currently, the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory:
	 AWS Directory Service AD Connector
	 IAM Roles

Take note that you can assign an IAM Role to the users or groups from your Active Directory once it is integrated with your 
VPC via the AWS Directory Service AD Connector.







AWS Fargate to run a batch job whenever an object is uploaded to S3:
	 Set up EventBridge rule to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to the ECS cluster to run a new ECS task.

EventBridge rule for detect all services level event.
It uses data from your own applications, integrated SaaS applications, and AWS services. 

EventBridge rule can runs an Amazon ECS task against a event, ECS tasks directly as targets for the CloudWatch Event rule.





 
Application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours:
	Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to perform a scaling action at specified times.
To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new 
minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. 

At the specified time, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates the group with the values for minimum, maximum, and desired size 
specified by the scaling action. 
 




Notify the development and operations team about the created or deleted S3 objects:
	Create an Amazon SNS topic and configure two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. 
	Grant Amazon S3 permission to send notifications to Amazon SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic.	

Take note that Amazon S3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once and to one destination only. 
You cannot attach two or more SNS topics or SQS queues for S3 event notification. 
Therefore, you must send the event notification to Amazon SNS.






Amazon storage services should Hot and Cold storage:
	Use Amazon FSx For Lustre and Amazon S3 for hot and cold storage respectively.

Although EFS supports concurrent access to data, it does not have the high-performance ability that is required for 
machine learning workloads.
FSx For Windows File Server does not have a parallel file system, unlike Lustre.

Hot storage refers to the storage that keeps frequently accessed data (hot data). 
Warm storage refers to the storage that keeps less frequently accessed data (warm data). 
Cold storage refers to the storage that keeps rarely accessed data (cold data). 
	
Amazon FSx For Lustre is a high-performance file system for fast processing of workloads. Lustre is a popular open-source 
parallel file system which stores data across multiple network file servers to maximize performance and reduce bottlenecks.

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed Microsoft Windows file system with full support for the SMB protocol, 
Windows NTFS, Microsoft Active Directory (AD) Integration.

Amazon Elastic File System is a fully-managed file storage service that makes it easy to set up and scale file storage in 
the Amazon Cloud. 

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.







Improve DynamoDB performance by distributing the workload evenly and using the provisioned throughput efficiently:
	 Use partition keys with high-cardinality attributes, which have a large number of distinct values for each item.

Remember that the more distinct partition key values your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the 
partitioned space. 

Conversely, the less distinct partition key values, the less evenly spread it would be across the partitioned space, 
which effectively slows the performance

A composite primary key will provide more partition for the table and in turn, improves the performance.
	 
	 
	 

	 
There are three main parts in a distributed messaging system:
	1. The components of your distributed system (EC2 instances)
	2. Your queue (distributed on Amazon SQS servers)
	3. Messages in the queue.	 







EBS:
	Although an EBS Volume can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, Instance and EBS must be in same AZ. 
	What we need is high-available storage that can span multiple availability zones.

EFS:
	Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, allowing Amazon EFS to provide a common 
	data source for workloads and applications running on more than one Amazon EC2 instance.

EFS only supports Linux workloads.
Amazon EFS provides two modes of throughput: Provisioned and Bursting. 

Amazon EFS offers four storage classes: 
	two regional storage classes, Amazon EFS Standard, and Amazon EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA), and 
	two One Zone storage classes, Amazon EFS One Zone, and Amazon EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA). 


EFS file systems can be accessed by Amazon EC2 Linux instances, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate, 
and AWS Lambda functions via a file system interface such as NFS protocol.
Mult-AZ

FSx for Lustre: 
	For machine learning model, Which scales to hundreds of gigabytes every second and sub-millisecond latencies.
	FSx for Lustre is designed to support any Linux workload and is POSIX-compliant.
FSx for Lustre automatically encrypts your information in-transit and at-rest, and is ISO, SOC, and PCI-DSS compliant.

Amazon FSx for Lustre also integrates with Amazon S3.
FSx for Lustre can only be used by Linux-based instances.
Mult-AZ

FSx for NetApp ONTAP:
	FSx for ONTAP delivers NFS, SMB and iSCSI storage powered by NetApp’s advanced data management system.
	Multiprotocol file and block storage support.
	High availability across multi-AZs.
Mult-AZ








DynamoDB event notified via email:
	 Enable DynamoDB Stream and create an AWS Lambda trigger, as well as the IAM role which contains all of the permissions that 
	 the Lambda function will need at runtime. The data from the stream record will be processed by the Lambda 
	 function which will then publish a message to SNS Topic that will notify the subscribers via email.

Remember that the DynamoDB Stream feature is not enabled by default. 
	 
	 





Wants a high-performing solution to migrate this workload to the AWS cloud to take advantage of the cloud’s high availability:
	 Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle in a Multi-AZ deployment by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).
	 Rehost the on-premises .NET application to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Multi-AZ environment which runs in multiple Availability Zones.

DMS:
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it easy to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, 
NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. 
You can use AWS DMS to migrate your data into the AWS Cloud or between combinations of cloud and on-premises setups.

With AWS DMS, you can perform one-time migrations, and you can replicate ongoing changes to keep sources and targets in sync.
Migrate to a different database engine use Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT).


AWS ElasticBeanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. 
	You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, 
	load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.
	Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.


AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) to migrate the on-premises Oracle database server to a new Amazon EC2 instance.
Amazon RDS supports standard Oracle databases so it would be better to use AWS DMS for the database migration, not AWS MGN.







Users take a lot of time to log into their website and HTTP 504 errors:
	Customize the content that the CloudFront web distribution delivers to your users using Lambda@Edge, which allows your 
	Lambda functions to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users.
	
	Set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins. Specify one as the primary origin and the other 
	as the second origin which CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code 
	failure responses.
	 
	 



Query data that resides in multiple AWS accounts from a central data lake:
	 Use AWS Lake Formation to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account.
A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics.

AWS Lake Formation is integrated with AWS Glue which you can use to create a data catalog that describes available datasets and 
their appropriate business applications.
Cross-account sharing which is free with AWS Lake Formation.





AWS resources centrally manage and share with multiple account:
	Use the AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) service to easily and securely share your resources with your AWS accounts. 
	Consolidate all of the company's accounts using AWS Organizations.

AWS Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you 
create and centrally manage.

AWS Control Tower simply offers the easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment. 
This is not the most suitable service to use to securely share your resources across AWS accounts or within your Organization. 
You have to use AWS Resources Access Manager (RAM) instead.





Aurora data-modifying info forwarded to a distributed processing system:
	Create a native function or a stored procedure that invokes a Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send event 
	notifications to an Amazon SQS queue for the processing system to consume.


RDS events only provide operational events such as DB instance events, DB parameter group events, DB security group events, and 
DB snapshot events. 
What we need  data-modifying events (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) which can be achieved thru native functions or stored procedures.






Use VPC endpoints to route all access to S3 and DynamoDB via private endpoints.

Transit Gateway simply connects your VPC and on-premises networks through a central hub. 
It acts as a cloud router that allows you to integrate multiple networks.





RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone.
RDS Read Replica provides an asynchronous replication.

DynamoDB do not have a Read Replica approach.
Global tables replicate your DynamoDB tables automatically across  Regions.





Monitor how the different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU, including the percentage of the 
CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each proces:
	Enable Enhanced Monitoring in RDS.

By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs for 30 days. To modify the amount of time the 
metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs, change the retention for the RDSOSMetrics log group in the CloudWatch console.

Differences between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring Metrics:  
	CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance, and 
	Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance. 

To get the specific percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database processes:
	Use Enhanced Monitoring metrics.
 
 
 
 
 
Move the files that are older than 2 years to a more cost-effective and scalable solution:
	The requirement is to move the files that are older than 2 years or 730 days, use  S3 Glacier after 2 years or S3 Standard-IA.
	
Maximum days for the EFS lifecycle policy is only 90 days. 





You can also sell your unused instance for Standard RIs but not Convertible RIs on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
You can reserve capacity to a specific AWS Region (regional Reserved Instance) or specific 
Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instance) only. 
You cannot reserve capacity to multiple AWS Regions in a single RI purchase.





Need a DB with unpredictable transactional workloads throughout:
	Launch an Amazon Aurora Serverless DB cluster then set the minimum and maximum capacity for the cluster.

Aurora without Aurora Serverless (provisioned DB clusters) works well when the database workload is predictable, 
because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload.




Mitigate multi-region failure lessthen 1m for RTO and RPO:
	Amazon Aurora Global Database.
	
Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database 
to span multiple AWS regions. It replicates your data with no impact on database performance, 
enables fast local reads with low latency in each region, and provides disaster recovery from region-wide outages.

RDS Multi-AZ deployment is only applicable inside a single region and not in a multi-region setup.





Launch a new file gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. 
Upload the documents to the file gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for data archival.

File gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points. With a file gateway, you can do the following:
	- You can store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.
	- You can store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.
	- You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.
	- You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. 

You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3.

AWS Storage Gateway supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA and Amazon Glacier storage classes.

AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.





RDS database can only be accessed using the profile credentials specific to your EC2 instances via an authentication token:
	Enable the IAM DB Authentication.
	
IAM database authentication provides the following benefits:
	Network traffic to and from the database is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
	You can use IAM to centrally manage access to your database resources, instead of managing access individually on each DB instance.
	For applications running on Amazon EC2, you can use profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database

Although STS is used to send temporary tokens for authentication, this is not a compatible use case for RDS.


	 
 
Client-side encryption is the act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3 are two way:
- Use an AWS KMS-managed customer master key.
- Use a client-side master key.

When using an AWS KMS-managed customer master key to enable client-side data encryption, you provide an 
AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. 

When you use client-side master key for client-side data encryption, your client-side master keys and your unencrypted data 
are never sent to AWS. 





Enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration in the bucket.
	Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact 
	with resources in a different domain.




Secure the session data in the portal by requiring them to enter a password before they are granted permission to execute Redis commands:
	 Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the 
	 --transit-encryption-enabled and 
	 --auth-token parameters enabled.
	 
	 
	 
	 

Database hostname-credentials, API credentials that prevent other developers access DEV, SIT, UAT, and PROD environments:
	Create a new KMS key and use it to enable encryption helpers that leverage on AWS Key Management Service to store and 
	encrypt the sensitive information.
	
Although Lambda encrypts the environment variables in your function by default, the sensitive information would still be 
visible to other users who have access to the Lambda console. This is because Lambda uses a default KMS key to encrypt 
the variables, which is usually accessible by other users. 

The best option in this scenario is to use encryption helpers to secure your environment variables.





Use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to keep the database credentials and then encrypt using AWS KMS. 
	Create an IAM Role for your Amazon ECS task execution role (taskRoleArn) and reference it with your task definition, 
	which allows access to both KMS and the Parameter Store. 

Within your container definition, specify secrets with the name of the environment variable to set in the container 
and the full ARN of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter containing the sensitive data to present to the container.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is just a feature of Amazon ECS that enables you to easily run and manage 
container workloads on customer-managed infrastructure.




A report of all compliance-related documents for their account:
	Use AWS Artifact to view the security reports as well as other AWS compliance-related information.
 

AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. 
It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. 

Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports,
Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and the Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).

	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
Even though AWS WAF can help you block common attack patterns to your VPC such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, this is 
still not enough to withstand DDoS attacks. It is better to use AWS Shield.

Create a rate-based rule in AWS WAF and associate the web ACL to an Application Load Balancer.
a regular rule only matches the statement defined in the rule. If you need to add a rate limit to your rule, you should create a 
rate-based rule.

AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that is primarily used to deploy essential network protections for all of your VPCs 
and not particularly to your Application Load Balancers.






Storage solution to a specific Amazon VPC only:
	Configure an Amazon S3 Access Point for the S3 bucket to restrict data access to a particular Amazon VPC only.
	Create a new Amazon S3 bucket with the S3 Object Lock feature enabled. Store the documents in the bucket and set the 
	Legal Hold option for object retention.
Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets.	 
S3 Multi-Region Access Points to provide a global endpoint that applications.	 

Before you lock any objects, you have to enable a bucket to use S3 Object Lock. 
When you create a bucket with Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for that bucket.
 
Object Versioning feature must also be enabled too in order for this to work. 
In fact, you cannot manually disable the Object Versioning feature if you have already selected the Object Lock option.





 
Amazon Macie generates two categories of findings: policy findings and sensitive data findings. 
	A policy finding is a detailed report of a potential policy violation or issue with the security or privacy of an  S3 bucket.
	A sensitive data finding is a detailed report of sensitive data in an S3 object.

Amazon Macie is an ML-powered security service that helps you prevent data loss by automatically discovering, classifying, 
and protecting sensitive data stored in Amazon S3. Amazon Macie uses machine learning to recognize sensitive data such as 
personally identifiable information (PII)

If you require external signals (deciders) to intervene in your processes, or you would like to launch child processes that 
return a result to a parent, then you should consider Amazon SWF.
Need to manager underline infrastructure.








A report that summarizes the total billing accrued by each department:
	Tag resources with the department name and enable cost allocation tags.

After you or AWS applies tags to your AWS resources (such as  EC2  or  S3 buckets) and you activate the 
tags in the Billing and Cost Management console, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file) 
with your usage and costs grouped by your active tags.

AWS Budgets only allows you to be alerted and run custom actions if your budget thresholds are exceeded.

Cost and Usage Report (CUR) provid cost by AWS services.






Architect has decided to move the historical records to AWS :
	Use AWS DataSync to move the historical records from on-premises to AWS. Choose Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to be the 
	destination for the data.

Getting started with DataSync is easy: deploy the DataSync agent, connect it to your file system, select your AWS storage resources, 
and start moving data between them. You pay only for the data you move(online).
You can use DataSync to migrate active data sets or archives to AWS.

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring and alerting service. 
This service makes it easy for you to monitor containerized applications and infrastructure at scale but not stream live feeds.

Create an Amazon EMR cluster and store the processed data in Amazon RedShift.
	Amazon EMR (previously known as Amazon Elastic MapReduce) is an Amazon Web Services big data tool for processing and analysis.

	Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on 
	AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. 

	Amazon Redshift is the most widely used cloud data warehouse. 
	It makes it fast, simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing 
	Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

To leverage big data processing frameworks, you need to use Amazon EMR. The cluster will perform data transformations (ETL) 
and load the processed data into Amazon Redshift for analytic and business intelligence applications.
 
Glue is just a serverless ETL service that crawls your data, builds a data catalog, performs data preparation, data transformation, 
and data ingestion. 
It won't allow you to utilize different big data frameworks effectively, unlike Amazon EMR.
  






MySQL database that needs to be replicated in Amazon S3 as CSV file:
	Create a full load and change data capture (CDC) replication task using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). 
	Add a new Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and create an AWS DMS endpoint with SSL.




Compliance requirements in these two locations, you want the Japanese users to connect to the servers in the 
ap-northeast-1 Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region, while the Swedish users should be connected to the servers in the eu-west-1 EU (Ireland).
	Use Route 53 Geolocation Routing policy.

Route 53 Weighted Routing policy:
		It just lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) or 
		subdomain name (forums.tutorialsdojo.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. 
		
		
		

On-premises web service clients can only access trusted IP addresses whitelisted on their firewalls:

	Create a DynamoDB gateway endpoint. Associate the endpoint to the appropriate route table. Use AWS Backup to automatically 
	copy the on-demand DynamoDB backups to another AWS account for disaster recovery.

DynamoDB on-demand backups cannot be copied to a different account or Region.
	
To create backup copies across AWS accounts and Regions and for other advanced features, you should use AWS Backup.	
Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) feature is not capable of restoring a DynamoDB table to a particular point in time in a different 
AWS account.





Simple Email Service- SES is a cloud-based email sending service designed to send notifications and transactional emails.
Use SNS instead of SES  when you want to monitor your EC2 instances.	
	
	


Here are the prerequisites for routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket:
- An S3 bucket that is configured to host a static website. The bucket must have the same name as your domain or subdomain. 
- A registered domain name. You can use Route 53 as your domain registrar, or you can use a different registrar.
- Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain. 





Use Amazon Rekognition to detect images with graphic nudity or violence in Amazon S3. 
Create an Interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Rekognition with the necessary policies to prevent any traffic from traversing the 
public Internet.

To connect your VPC to Amazon Rekognition, you define an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Rekognition. An interface 
endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported 
AWS service.

Amazon GuardDuty is primarily used as an intelligent threat detection solution and not a networking service.

Amazon Detective is commonly used to analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of potential security issues in your 
AWS workloads, as well as for detecting suspicious activities.

Increase network availability by allowing the traffic flow to resume in another instance if the primary instance is terminated:
	Create a secondary elastic network interface and point its private IPv4 address to the application’s domain name. 
	Attach the new network interface to the primary instance. If the instance goes down, move the secondary network interface to 
	another instance.
	
	



Using an Elastic Load Balancer is an ideal solution for adding elasticity to your application. Alternatively, you can also 
create a policy in Route 53, such as a Weighted routing policy, to evenly distribute the traffic to 2 or more EC2 instances.





EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated within that region only, and not on a separate AWS region, 
to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.

EBS volumes can only be attached to an EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone.
EBS Volume snapshots are actually sent to Amazon S3.





In Route 53, which record types will you use to point the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer?
Alias with a type "AAAA" record set and Alias with a type "A" record set.





In Auto Scaling, the following statements are correct regarding the cooldown period:
	It ensures that the Auto Scaling group does not launch or terminate additional EC2 instances before the 
	previous scaling activity takes effect.
	Its default value is 300 seconds - 5m.
	It is a configurable setting for your Auto Scaling group.





Monitor the available swap space of each EC2:
	Install the CloudWatch agent on each instance and monitor the SwapUtilization metric.





CloudWatch Alam is primarily used for monitoring CloudWatch metrics.
CloudWatch Events service is commonly used to deliver a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in some 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.





Data access from S3 with their strict compliance standards, unauthorized access or suspicious access patterns in S3:
	Use Amazon GuardDuty to monitor malicious activity on S3.





Generate an endpoint policy for trusted S3 buckets.
When you create a Gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy that controls access to the service to which you are connecting.





AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
Config dashboard shows the compliance status of your rules and resources. You can verify if your resources 
comply with your desired configurations and learn which specific resources are noncompliant.

AWS Trusted Advisor only provides best practice recommendations. It cannot define rules for your AWS resources.

CloudTrail can track changes and store a history of what happened to your resources, this service still cannot enforce rules 
to comply with your organization's policies.






Each organization unit (OU) must be able to launch new accounts with preapproved configurations from the security team:
	Set up an AWS Control Tower Landing Zone. Enable pre-packaged guardrails to enforce policies or detect violations.

AWS Control Tower provides a single location to easily set up your new well-architected multi-account environment and 
govern your AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and internal compliance. 
you can select and apply pre-packaged policies enterprise-wide or to specific groups of accounts.






Application takes several minutes to become fully operational:
	Migrate the application to an EC2 instance with hibernation enabled.

While the instance is in hibernation, you pay only for the EBS volumes and Elastic IP Addresses attached to it; there are 
no other hourly charges (just like any other stopped instance).

CloudEndure Migration is just a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, 
and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS. 






The company require consistent and dedicated access to these network:
	Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. 
	Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.
	
AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks. 
You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN and Direct Connect connections) to a single Transit Gateway 
consolidating and controlling your organization's.

By attaching a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway using a transit virtual interface, you can manage a single connection 
for multiple VPCs or VPNs that are in the same AWS Region.







What service must be used to easily capture, transform, and load streaming data into S3, ElasticSearch, and Splunk?
	Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into  S3,  Redshift,  Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you are already using today.

Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is primarily used to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools.
SQS can't capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3,

AWS Data Exchange is  is just a data marketplace service.






To save costs, From Reserved instances as soon as possible:
	Go to the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace and sell the Reserved instances.
	Terminate the Reserved instances as soon as possible to avoid getting billed at the on-demand price when it expires.
	 
Stopping the Reserved instances as soon as possible if false because It is also possible that there are associated 
Elastic IP addresses, which will incur charges. You have to terminate.





S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. 
Transfer Acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed AWS Edge Locations. 
As data arrives at an AWS Edge Location, data is routed to your  S3 bucket over an optimized network path.






AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both ECS and EKS.

Amazon EKS is more suitable to run the Kubernetes management infrastructure and not Docker. 
It not remove the need to provision and manage servers nor let you specify and pay for resources per application, unlike Fargate EKS.






Collect logs and then easily perform log analysis:
	 S3 for storing ELB log files and EMR for analyzing the log files.
	 
Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data tools managed Hadoop framework and solution for petabyte-scale data 
processing, interactive analytics, and machine learning using open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto.







Launch a real-time analytics service:
	Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream.

Although Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose captures and loads data in near real-time, AWS Lambda can't be set as its destination.





You can create read replicas within a Region or between Regions for your 
RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database instances encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).





S3 is composed of buckets, object keys, object metadata, object tags, and many other components as shown below:
	S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts.
	S3 object key refers to the key name, which uniquely identifies the object in the bucket.
	S3 object metadata is a name-value pair that provides information about the object.
	S3 object tag is a key-pair value used for object tagging to categorize storage.
	 
 
 


Ensure that the required components are properly running before the CloudFormation stack creation proceeds:
	Configure a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. 
	Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper script.
	
In CloudFormation template Use the CreationPolicy attribute when you want to wait on resource configuration actions 
before stack creation proceeds. 

In such cases, you can add a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance and then send a success signal to the instance 
after the applications are installed and configured.





Docker It is compulsory that the application has access to 5 GB of ephemeral storage:
	Deploy the application to an Amazon ECS cluster that uses Fargate tasks.
By default, Fargate tasks are given a minimum of 20 GiB of free ephemeral storage. 
	
	 



A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. 
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as they are in the same network. 

You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs,  another AWS account, or different Region.





Amazon Aurora DB cluster to Autora serverless:
	Changing the Aurora instance class from Provisioned to Serverless is not possible.
	Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate to a new Aurora Serverless database.
AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate your databases to AWS with virtually no downtime. 
You can set up a DMS task for either one-time migration or ongoing replication. 

Take a snapshot involves a long period of downtime since you have to stop the application until the new cluster is created.

Add an Aurora Replica to the cluster and set its instance class to Serverless,While this method is valid, 
the database becomes unavailable for writing for a short period of time during failover.





You can launch an EBS-backed EC2 instance and attach several Instance Store volumes but remember that there are some 
EC2 Instance types that don't support this kind of setup.

ENI will stay attached even if you stopped your EC2 instance.
EIP will actually remain associated with your instance even after stopping it.


Since only EBS-backed instances can be stopped and restarted, it is implied that the instance is EBS-backed. 
Remember that an instance store-backed instance can only be rebooted or terminated, and its data will be erased if the 
EC2 instance is either stopped or terminated.

If you stopped an EBS-backed EC2 instance, the volume is preserved, but the data in any attached instance store volume will be erased. 
Keep in mind that an EC2 instance has an underlying physical host computer. 
If the instance is stopped, AWS usually moves the instance to a new host computer. 
Your instance may stay on the same host computer if there are no problems with the host computer.
 
In addition, its Elastic IP address is remove from the instance if it is an EC2-Classic instance. 
Otherwise, if it is an EC2-VPC instance, the Elastic IP address remains associated.






MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS is running out of disk storage:
	Modify the DB instance settings to enable autoscaling.





Aurora as the Amazon RDS database need 90-day backup retention:
	Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily snapshots with a retention period of 90 days.

Aurora maximum backup retention period for automated backup is only 35 days.

AWS Backup makes protecting your AWS storage volumes, databases, and file systems simple by providing a central place where you 
can configure and audit the AWS resources you want to backup, automate backup scheduling, set retention policies, 
and monitor all recent backup and restore activity.


Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager DLM for EBS Snapshots can schedule the back up Amazon EBS volumes into EBS Snapshots.
AWS Backup to manage backups of Amazon Aurora DB clusters.



You are limited to provision a maximum of 20 instances per region or 
On-Demand Instances per your vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit, 
20 Reserved Instances, and requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit per region. 

New AWS accounts may start with limits that are lower than the limits described here.

vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit is set per region and not per Availability Zone. 






The company’s solutions architect must implement a solution that checks for untagged AWS resources.
	Use an AWS Config rule to detect non-compliant tags.
	
	
	
	
Developers are unable to remove or modify any rules in AWS Config.
	 Add the developers' AWS account to an Organization Unit (OU). Attach a service control policy (SCP) to the OU that 
	 restricts access to AWS Config.
	 
SCPs alone is not sufficient to grant permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. 
An SCP defines a guardrail or sets limits on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles 
in the affected accounts.

In the scenario, even if a developer has admin privileges, he/she will be unable to modify Config rules if an SCP does not permit it.

Configure an AWS Config rule, This solution just monitors changes on AWS Config rules; 
it does not restrict permissions, which is what's needed in the scenario. 

The AWS Control Tower service is commonly used to set up and govern a secure multi-account AWS environment. 
This service is not used to restrict access from invoking an action to a specific resource, such as AWS Config.







Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) :
	with a master key that it regularly rotates. 
	S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption.

	 
Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS):
	use envelope encryption,SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. 
	Additionally, you can create and manage customer-managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are unique to you, your service, 
	and your Region.

Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C):
	You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption when you access 
	your objects.

SSE-S3 and SSE-C do not provide  audit trail that shows when your Key was used and by whom,unlike SSE-KMS.
	 
	 
	 



Unified CloudWatch agent, and an older CloudWatch Logs agen:
	Collect both logs and advanced metrics with the installation and configuration of just one agent.
	
Unified agent collect metrics and logs from  EC2, hybrid, and on-premises servers running both Linux and Windows
Unified agent also enables the collection of additional system metrics, for in-guest visibility.
	
CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in CloudWatch Logs.	
	 
	 
	 


Duplicating resources in another region:
	AWS CloudFormation
You can create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like  EC2 or RDS ), 
AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you with VPC.

AWS ElasticBeanstalk is incorrect. 
	Elastic Beanstalk is a high-level service that simplifies the creation of application resources such as an 
	EC2 with preconfigured proxy servers (Nginx or Apache), a load balancer, an auto-scaling group, and so on. 
	Elastic Beanstalk environments have limited resources; for example, Elastic Beanstalk does not create a VPC for you.




 
Auto Scaling group need new AMI instance:
	 Create a new Launch Configuration with the new instance type and update the Auto Scaling Group.
	 You can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it.
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
EBS provides three volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads: 
	General Purpose (SSD)   for cost-effective storage option for a wide variety of workloads.  gp2
	Provisioned IOPS (SSD)  for very intensive I/O workloads that require very high throughput. io1 
	Magnetic                for Low-cost HDD volume designed for throughput-intensive/infrequently accessed data workloads. st1/sc1




	 
Increase read-throughput on the MySQL database:
	Enable Amazon RDS Read Replicas
	 
Read replicas are available in Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL as well as Amazon Aurora.	 
	 
	 




VM workloads to the AWS cloud, “lift-and-shift” strategy: 
		Install the AWS Replication Agent on each of the on-premises VMs to continuously replicate the servers to AWS. 
		Use AWS Migration Service (AWS MGN) to launch test instances and perform cutover once testing is completed.
		
AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS.	 
AWS MGN enables organizations to move applications to AWS without having to make any changes to the applications, 
their architecture, or the migrated servers.

AWS MGN automatically converting your source servers from physical, virtual machines, and cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS.
Implementation begins by installing the AWS Replication Agent on your source servers.
	 
	 
AWS Application Discovery Service is primarily used to track the migration status not capable of doing the actual migration.


	 
	 
	 

Requirement if I/O throughput is the highest priority:
		Use Storage optimized instances with Instance Store Volume.
	 
EC2 Instance types can be broadly classified into five:
	General Purpose         =  Provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources.
	Compute-Optimized       =  These types of instances have a higher CPU to memory ratio.
	Memory-Optimized        =  Optimized to execute memory-intensive operations like in-memory databases or processing real-time data.
	Storage-Optimized       =  Storage optimized EC2 instances are used to support high I/O workloads such as parallel processing.
	Accelerated Computing   =  It provides compute capacity for very high performant machine learning and scientific workloads( With GPU).

Development of its GraphQL APIs, custom domain feature and https:
	Develop the application using the AWS AppSync service and use its built-in custom domain feature. 
	Associate an SSL certificate to the AWS AppSync API using the ACM service to enable HTTPS communication.

With AppSync, you can use custom domain names to configure a single, memorable domain that works for both your GraphQL and real-time APIs.
	
	
	
	
	 
	 
Multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN,slow connectivity issues:
	Associate the VPCs to an Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMR)-enabled Transit Gateway and attach additional VPN tunnels.
	 
AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale the IPsec VPN throughput with equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over 
multiple VPN tunnels. 
A single VPN tunnel still has a maximum throughput of 1.25 Gbps. 
If you establish multiple VPN tunnels to an ECMP-enabled Transit Gateway, it can scale beyond the default limit of 1.25 Gbps.

	 
	 
	 
	 
For provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies: 
	Enable Enhanced Networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on the Windows EC2 Instances. 
	 
With RDS Enhanced Monitoring, you can monitor the operating system of your DB instance in real time.
With EC2 enable Detailed Monitoring, EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1-minute period for the instance.

	 
	 
	 
	 
In SQS the number of messages is constantly growing:	 
		Create an AMI of the backend application's EC2 instance. Use the image to set up an Auto Scaling group and configure a 
		target tracking scaling policy based on the ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric.
		
The ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric is useful when applications have time-sensitive messages and you need to ensure that 
messages are processed within a specific time period.






On Receives a burst of traffic then instance takes 1 minute to boot up before it can respond to user requests:
		Create a step scaling policy and configure an instance warm-up time condition.
	 
	 
	 
	 

Telecommunication carriers' 5G networks:	 
		Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create node groups in 
		Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster via the AWS Wavelength service. 
		Apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (aws-auth ConfigMap) to your cluster.
		
AWS Wavelength combines the high bandwidth and ultralow latency of 5G networks with AWS compute and storage services so that 
developers can innovate and build a new class of applications.
	
	



The Volume Gateway is a cloud-based iSCSI block storage volume for your on-premises applications.

There are two options for Volume Gateway:
	Cached Volumes - you store volume data in AWS, with a small portion of recently accessed data in the cache on-premises.
	Stored Volumes - you store the entire set of volume data on-premises and store periodic point-in-time backups (snapshots) in AWS.

Network Firewall is a stateful, supports both stateless and stateful rules. 
Network ACLs are stateless.
 
 
 


IAM roles are global services that are available to all regions hence, 
all you have to do is assign the existing IAM role to the instance in the new region.





Multi-Region VPC transfer data between the instances without traversing the public internet:
	Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs.
	Re-configure the route table’s target and destination of the instances’ subnet.

VPC endpoints are region-specific only and do not support inter-region communication.
VPC endpoint enables users to privately connect their VPC to supported AWS services. 




Generated log files should be encrypted to avoid any security issues:
	Use CloudTrail with its default settings.
	
By default, CloudTrail event log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE). 
You can also choose to encrypt your log files with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. 





In EBS encryption, what service does AWS use to secure the volume's data at rest? 
	By using your own keys       	in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
	By using Amazon-managed keys 	in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).






Enable the security team to inspect traffic entering and exiting their VPC:
	Create a firewall using the AWS Network Firewall service at the VPC level then add custom rule groups for inspecting ingress 
	and egress traffic. Update the necessary VPC route tables.

Traffic Mirroring is simply an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface. 
Traffic mirror filters can't inspect the actual packet of the incoming and outgoing traffic.






Processing should not be delayed or interrupted:
	Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.

On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone 
for any duration






Performance Issue of the Kinesis Data Streams:
	Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the UpdateShardCount command.	




Highly scalable, yet still cost-effective:
	Launch an Auto-Scaling group of EC2 instances to host your application services and an SQS queue. 
	Include an Auto Scaling trigger to watch the SQS queue size which will either scale in or scale out the number of 
	EC2 instances based on the queue.
	
	
	
	
Extracting and visualizing sentiments from the transcribed files:
	Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. 
	Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.
	
	


Lambda execution The default timeout is 3 seconds, and minumum 1 second up to a maximum value of 15 minutes.




Set up the multi-account AWS environment for your company:
	Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies to control services on each account.

AWS Organizations offers policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. 
With Organizations, you can create groups of accounts, automate account creation, apply and manage policies for those groups.

Organizations enable you to centrally manage policies across multiple accounts without requiring custom scripts and manual processes. 
It allows you to create Service Control Policies (SCPs) that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.












@@@@
10 applications with an on-premises 70TB data for each application, two weeks to migration:
	Order 10 Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer.
	Setup Site-to-Site VPN to establish on-going connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud.

Snowball Edge:
	It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity.
 
Site-to-Site VPN:
	VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest 
	bandwidth requirements with internat base connectivity.

Snowmobile capacity of up to 100 Petabytes. 
To migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single location, you should use Snowmobile.
For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball. 




When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version.
S3 stores the Retain Until Date setting in the object version's metadata and protects the object version until the retention period expires.

In Default setting you S3, specify a duration, in either days or years, for every object version placed in the bucket.





Intermediary query results are kept only for 24 hours:
	Store the intermediary query results in S3 Standard class.

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval:
	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same throughput and milliseconds access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes.
It is designed for rarely accessed data that still needs immediate access in performance-sensitive 
use cases like image hosting, online file-sharing.

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval to reduce storage costs  58% for petabytes of infrequently-accessed,minimum storage duration of 90 days.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive has a minimum storage duration of 180 days. S3 Standard-IA,S3 One Zone-IA and Intelligence tear min 30 day.

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval provides three retrieval options:
Expedited retrievals  = 1–5 minutes.
Standard retrievals   = 3–5 hours
Bulk retrievals       = 5–12 hours




Native Windows workloads should continue to AWS:
	Use FSx File Gateway to provide low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in  FSx for Windows File Server.
	The applications deployed on AWS can access this data directly from Amazon FSx in AWS.
	SMB clients with native Windows SMB environment)

Amazon Storage Gateway’s File Gateway: 
	When you need to access S3 using a file system protocol, you should use File Gateway with SMB or NFS. 
	File Gateway does not support file shares for native Windows workloads, for that use Amazon FSx File Gateway.

Different types of gateways:
	Tape Gateway, 
	S3 File Gateway,
	FSx File Gateway,
	Volume Gateway.




Integrate data files from application with AWS Cloud via an NFS interface:
	AWS Storage Gateway - File Gateway.
	
AWS Storage Gateway's file interface, or file gateway,In order to store application data files and backup images as durable objects on Amazon S3 cloud storage. 

File gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching. 
As the company wants to integrate data files from its analytical instruments into AWS via an NFS interface, 
therefore AWS Storage Gateway - File Gateway is the correct answer.

Volume Gateway to present iSCSI block storage volumes, Volume Gateway does not support NFS interface.
Tape Gateway does not support NFS interface.
You cannot use AWS Site-to-Site VPN to integrate data files via the NFS interface.




1 EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in region B:
	When the new AMI is copied from region A into region B, it automatically creates a snapshot in region B because AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots.
	



GuardDuty service. All the existing findings have to be deleted:
	Disable the service in the general settings - Disabling the service will delete all remaining data, including your 
	findings and configurations before relinquishing the service permissions and resetting the service.

Suspend the service in the general settings:
	This will immediately stop the service from analyzing data, but does not delete your existing findings or configurations.
	
No De-register option on GuardDuty, only Disable and Suspend.


	


ALB Routing:
	Host-based Routing:
	You can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing you to route to multiple 
	domains from the same load balancer.

	Path-based Routing:
	You can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header.

	HTTP header-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header.

	HTTP method-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on any standard or custom HTTP method.

	Query string parameter-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on the query string or query parameters.

	Source IP address CIDR-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates.

The path pattern is applied only to the path of the URL, not to its query parameters.





Requires exactly 10 instances to be available during the peak hour:
	Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off at the right hour on the last day of the month. 
	Set the desired capacity of instances to 10. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour.

A scheduled action sets the minimum, maximum, and desired sizes to what is specified by the scheduled action at the time 
specified by the scheduled action. For the given use case, the correct solution is to set the desired capacity to 10. 
When we want to specify a range of instances, then we must use min and max values.

Target tracking and simple tracking policy cannot be used to effect a scaling action at a certain target hour.




AWS services would you recommend as a caching layer:
	DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB.
	ElastiCache - Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is an ideal front-end for data stores like Amazon RDS or Amazon DynamoDB.

Use Instance Store based EC2 instances for high random I/O performance at low cost,and the resilient architecture 
	can adjust for the loss of any instance.

Use EBS based EC2 instances - 
	EBS based volumes would need to use Provisioned IOPS (io1) as the storage type and that would 
	incur additional costs. As we are looking for the most cost-optimal solution, this option is ruled out.

Use EC2 instances with EFS mount points - 
	Using EFS implies that extra resources would have to be provisioned. 
	As we are looking for the most resource-efficient solution, this option is also ruled out.




Configure AWS WAF on the Application Load Balancer in a VPC:
	WAF with ALB to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web access control list (web ACL). 
	Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF allows you to use AWS WAF to restrict application access based on the 
	geographic location of your viewers. 
With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.
	
Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a VPC :
	CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the user's geographic location. 
	But, CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC, this is Incorrect.





Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Firehose and use an intermediary Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream 
before the output is dumped on S3.

	Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
	It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, 
	and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards.

	Kinesis Data Analytics cannot directly ingest data from the source, it ingests data either from 
	Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose, so this option is ruled out.

	Kinesis Data Streams cannot directly write the output to S3. Unlike Firehose, KDS does not offer a ready-made integration via an 
	intermediary Lambda function to reliably dump data into S3. 

	EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. 
	Using an EMR cluster would imply managing the underlying infrastructure so it’s ruled out.
	 
	 
 

Make More resilient to spikes in request rates:
	You can use Aurora replicas and CloudFront distribution.

Aurora Replicas have two main purposes. 
	You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application.
	Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, 
Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.

Use AWS Global Accelerator - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your 
applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application 
endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions.
Since CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic, so this option is ruled out.




Since the data is accessed only twice in a financial year but needs rapid access when required, the most cost-effective 
storage class for this use-case is S3 Standard-IA. 

Standard-IA has the same availability as that of S3 Intelligent-Tiering. So, it's cost-efficient to use 
S3 Standard-IA instead of S3 Intelligent-Tiering.




Maintenance patching to instance, MOST time/resource efficient steps:
	Put the instance into the Standby state and then update the instance by applying the maintenance patch. 
	Once the instance is ready, you can exit the Standby state and then return the instance to service
You can put an instance that is in the InService state into the Standby state, update some software or troubleshoot the instance.	
Instances that are on standby are still part of the Auto Scaling group, but they do not actively handle application traffic.	

Suspend the ReplaceUnhealthy process for the Auto Scaling group and apply the maintenance patch to the instance. 
Once the instance is ready, you can manually set the instance's health status back to healthy and activate the 
ReplaceUnhealthy process type again.

Taking the snapshot of the existing instance to create a new AMI and then creating a new instance not time/resource optimal.




Peak rate of about 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS:
	Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate(4*300=1200).
	
Maximum batch 10 messages per operation , FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 messages per second. 
Maximum batch size for a standard Amazon SQS queue is 10,000 records. 	



24*7 in the production environment and 8 hour for dev:
	Use reserved EC2 instances for the production application and on-demand instances for the dev application.

Spot blocks can only be used for a span of up to 6 hours, so this option does not meet the requirements,
also note that AWS has stopped offering Spot blocks to new customers.



There are no S3 data transfer charges when data is transferred in from the internet. 
Also with S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated.
Does not need to pay any transfer charges for the upload because S3TA did not result in an accelerated transfer.



Default ASG Scaling- IN: Select the AZ with most instance and then:
	First priority is given to any allocation strategy for On-Demand vs Spot instances. 
	The next priority is to consider any instance with the oldest launch template unless there is an instance 
	that uses a launch configuration. So this rules out Instance A. 
	Next, you need to consider any instance which has the oldest launch configuration. 
	then which is closest to the next billing hour.
	
	


Wants to manage the workload using a mix of on-demand and spot instances across multiple instance types:
	You can only use a launch template to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both 
	On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances to achieve the desired scale, performance, and cost.
	
You cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both 
On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances.




ASG is not terminating an unhealthy EC2 instance:
	The health check grace period for the instance has not expired.(with until the health check grace period expires, def 5m, with CLI 0)
	The instance maybe in Impaired status.(waits a few minutes for the instance to recover.)
	The instance has failed the ELB health check status. (By default, ASG doesn't use the results of ELB health )
	
	Checks to determine an instance's health status when the group's health check configuration is set to EC2. As a result, 
	Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't terminate instances that fail ELB health checks)
	
ASG terminates Spot instances when capacity is no longer available or the Spot price exceeds your maximum price.
ASG needs more number of instances, ASG will launch new, healthy instances and does not keep unhealthy ones alive.
ASG terminates the unhealthy instance also if A custom health check might have failed.




Kinesis Agent cannot write to a Kinesis Firehose for which the delivery stream source is already set as Kinesis Data Streams.

Kinesis Agent is a stand-alone Java software application that offers an easy way to collect and send data to 
Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Firehose.




AWS Organizations and you would like to ensure all EC2 instances in all these accounts can communicate privately:
	Create a VPC in an account and share one or more of its subnets with the other accounts using Resource Access Manager(RAM).
AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises.
	
AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any 
AWS account or within your AWS Organization. You can share Transit Gateways, Subnets,Reoute53, DNS Resolver etc.
	
AWS RAM is a Regional service. When you share a resource with principals in other AWS accounts, 
they must access each resource from the same AWS Region that it was created in.




Run their applications on single-tenant hardware and MOST cost-effective way of isolating EC2 instances to a single tenant:
	Dedicated Instances. (IF NO NEED BYOL)

A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use. (WITH BYOL)
With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server.
This option is costlier than the Dedicated Instance and hence is not the right choice for the current requirement.





Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the raw zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day of object creation.
Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using a compressed file format.

It is cost-optimal to write the data in the refined zone using a compressed format instead of CSV format.

By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it. 
So the S3 bucket owner will not implicitly have access to the objects written by Redshift cluster.




AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green environment and 
vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers(mobile phones which are to DNS caching).

Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments not working because
DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Route 53 is not a good option.

ALB with weighted target groups feature for blue/green deployments not working because ALB not Global servies it Regional.




All the log files (consisting of system logs, application logs, database logs, etc) that can be processed in a serverless fashion: Kinesis Data Firehose.
	
 
 
 

"Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
	"StringEquals": {
	  "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
	}
	
aws:RequestedRegion represents the target of the API call. 
So we can only launch EC2 instances in eu-west-1, and we can do this API call from anywhere.



Prevent team of developers in your company, make self admin:
	For each developer, define an IAM permission boundary that will restrict the managed policies they can attach to themselves.
AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or roles) not IAM Group.

SCP not work here because, SCPs working with your AWSOrganization accounts.





Notifies the security team 30 days before the certificate expiration:
	Leverage AWS Config managed rule to check if any third-party SSL/TLS certificates imported into ACM are marked for expiration 
	within 30 days. 
	Configure the rule to trigger an SNS notification to the security team if any certificate expires within 30 days.

You can leverage an AWS Config managed rule to check if any ACM certificates in your account are marked for 
expiration within the specified number of days what is imported.

Any SSL/TLS certificates created by ACM do not need any monitoring/intervention for expiration. 
ACM automatically renews such certificates. 

It is possible to use the days to expiry CloudWatch metric to build a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the imported ACM certificates. 
But this option needs more configuration effort than directly using the AWS Config managed rule.




Notified via an email whenever the CPU utilization high:
	SNS and Amazon CloudWatch.
You can use CloudWatch Alarms to send an email via SNS whenever any of the EC2 instances breaches a certain threshold.
	
	
	

Decouple the user authentication process for the application:
	Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your Application Load Balancer.
Application Load Balancer can be used to securely authenticate users for accessing your applications.

You cannot directly integrate Cognito User Pools with CloudFront distribution as you need to create a separate Lambda@Edge 
This involves additional development effort.




Replicate the newly created on-premises video files to the EFS file system:
	Configure an AWS DataSync agent on the on-premises server that has access to the NFS file system. 
	Transfer data over the Direct Connect connection to an AWS PrivateLink interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EFS by using a private VIF. 
	Set up a DataSync scheduled task to send the video files to the EFS file system every 24 hours.
	



PostgreSQL port = 5432 HTTP port = 80 HTTPS port = 443
	The security group of RDS should have an inbound rule from the security group of the EC2 instances in the ASG on port 5432
	The security group of the EC2 instances should have an inbound rule from the security group of the ALB on port 80
	The security group of the ALB should have an inbound rule from anywhere on port 443




DNS queries for any resources in the on-premises network from the AWS VPC and visvisa:
	Create an inbound endpoint on Route53 Resolver and then DNS Resolvers on the on-premises network can forward DNS queries 
	to Route 53 Resolver via this endpoint.

	Create an outbound endpoint on Route 53 Resolver and then Route 53 Resolver can conditionally forward queries to resolvers 
	on the on-premises network via this endpoint.




Company wants to run directory-aware workloads on AWS :
	AWS Managed Microsoft AD

AD Connector - Use AD Connector if you only need to allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services 
with their Active Directory credentials. 
You cannot use it to run directory-aware workloads on AWS, hence this option is not correct.

Simple AD is a standalone managed directory that is powered by a Samba 4 Active Directory Compatible Server. 
Simple AD does not support features such as trust relationships with other domains and many more.

Amazon Cloud Directory - Amazon Cloud Directory is a cloud-native directory that can store hundreds of millions of 
application-specific objects with multiple relationships and schemas. 
Use Amazon Cloud Directory if you need a highly scalable directory store for your application’s hierarchical data. 
You cannot use it to establish trust relationships with other domains on the on-premises infrastructure. 

AWS Managed Microsoft AD is your best choice if you have more than 5,000 users and need a trust relationship set up between an 
AWS hosted directory and your on-premises directories. 

Simple AD is the least expensive option and your best choice 
if you have 5,000 or fewer users and don’t need the more advanced Microsoft Active Directory features such as trust 
relationships with other domains.



Spot instances:	
	If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted
	Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted
	When you cancel an active spot request, it does not terminate the associated instance



Service control policies (SCPs):
Restract the user permission, SCPs affect all users and roles in attached accounts, including the root user

SCPs do not affect service-linked role
	A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service. 
	Service-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call 
	other AWS services on your behalf.




Live sports results via UDP:
	Use Global Accelerator to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results.
Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP. 

CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests not UDP, therefore this option is incorrect.
ALB or ASG cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the source.




Each EC2 instance that you launch into a VPC has a tenancy attribute(default, dedicated, host):
	You can only change the tenancy of an instance from dedicated to host and host to dedicated after you've launched it.



If either Launch Configuration Tenancy or VPC Tenancy is set to dedicated, then the instance tenancy is also dedicated.
	When you create a launch configuration, the default value for the instance placement tenancy is null and the 
	instance tenancy is controlled by the tenancy attribute of the VPC. 

	If you set the Launch Configuration Tenancy to default and the VPC Tenancy is set to dedicated, 
	then the instances have dedicated tenancy. 
	If you set the Launch Configuration Tenancy to dedicated and the VPC Tenancy is set to default, 
	then again the instances have dedicated tenancy.




Multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN:
	If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can using the AWS VPN CloudHub. 

The corporate headquarters has an AWS Direct Connect connection to the VPC and the branch offices have 
Site-to-Site VPN connections to the VPC.
Therefore using the AWS VPN CloudHub, branch offices can send and receive data with each other as well as with their 
corporate headquarters.

VPC Endpoint - A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services 
powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

VPC peering facilitates a connection between two VPCs within the same AWS network, therefore this option cannot be used to 
send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.

Software VPN just handles connectivity between the remote network and Amazon VPC, therefore it cannot be used to send and 
receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.

VPC Peering not support Hybrid(on-promis to cloud) conn | Transit gateway support.
VPC Peering has securityGroup 							| TGW has reoute table.
Low cost since 											| High cost.


ECS container instances running behind an ALB website slows down when the traffic spikes:
	Configure AWS Auto Scaling to scale out the ECS cluster when the ECS service's CPU utilization rises above a threshold.
	


Address Translation for the EC2 instance:
	Internet Gateway, Address Translation is done by Internet Gateway.
Additionally, an Internet Gateway supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you must do the following:
	Attach an Internet gateway to your VPC.
	Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).
	Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance.
	
	




Pre-defined configurations for all deployment across accounts and regions, such as using a specific type EC2, specific IAM roles:
	Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy the same template across AWS accounts and regions.
A StackSets lets you create stacks for different AWS accounts across regions by using a single AWS CloudFormation template.
Using an administrator account of an "AWS Organization".

CloudFormation templates cannot be used to deploy the same template across AWS accounts and regions.	
	




Purchased the domain covid19survey.com using Route 53:
	Create an alias record for covid19survey.com that routes traffic to www.covid19survey.com

You cannot create a CNAME record for the top node of the DNS namespace, so this option is incorrect.

Additionally, an alias record can only redirect queries to selected AWS resources such as S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, 
and another record in the same Route 53 hosted zone; however a CNAME record can redirect DNS queries to any DNS record. 
So, you can create a CNAME record that redirects queries from app.covid19survey.com to app.covid19survey.net.




Your application is hosted by a provider on yourapp.provider.com. 
You would like to have your users access your application using www.your-domain.com ?
	Create a CNAME record
A CNAME record maps DNS queries for the name of the current record, such as acme.example.com, to another domain 
(example.com or example.net) or subdomain (acme.example.com or zenith.example.org).
		
CNAME records can be used to map one domain name to another. 
Although you should keep in mind that the DNS protocol does not allow you to create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace, 
also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com. 
You cannot create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create CNAME records for www.example.com, newproduct.example.com, and so on.




What does this CloudFormation snippet do? (Select three)

SecurityGroupIngress:
     - IpProtocol: tcp
       FromPort: 80
       ToPort: 80
       CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
     - IpProtocol: tcp
       FromPort: 22
       ToPort: 22
       CidrIp: 192.168.1.1/32
	   
It allows any IP to pass through on the HTTP port.
It configures a security group's inbound rules.
It lets traffic flow from one IP on port 22.

	   


Authenticate to your DB instance:
	Use IAM authentication from Lambda to RDS PostgreSQL
	Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to AWS Lambda

Authenticate to your DB instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. 
IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
With this authentication method, you don't need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance. 
Instead, you use an authentication token.		   




Route 53 simple record to point "myapp.mydomain.com" from the old Load Balancer to the new one:
	The TTL is still in effect - TTL (time to live), is the amount of time, in seconds, 
	that you want DNS recursive resolvers to cache information about a record.
	
	


DB failover facilitate with a short Recovery Time Objective (RTO):
	Provision Amazon Aurora Global Database.
Aurora Global Database is good for applications that need to support cross-Region reads with low latency updates and the ability to 
quickly failover between regions. 

DynamoDB global tables provide cross-region active-active capabilities with high performance, but you lose some of the data access 
flexibility that comes with SQL-based databases. 
Due to the active-active configuration of DynamoDB global tables, there is no concept of failover because the 
application writes to the table in its region, and then the data is replicated to keep the other regions' table in sync. 
DynamoDB global tables is a much costlier solution than Aurora Global Database for the given requirement.



Concerned about the VPC-bound components accessing SQS over the public internet:
	Use VPC endpoint to access Amazon SQS
without using public IPs, and without needing to traverse the public internet.	



Set up a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3. Attach an endpoint policy to the endpoint. 
Update the route table to direct the S3-bound traffic to the VPC endpoint.


VPC in four different ways with the wizard:
	VPC with a public subnet  only
	VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access

	VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)
	VPC with public and private subnets and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access



Fully managed NoSQL persistent database with in-memory caching:
	DynamoDB
It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, 
backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications with DAX.	

ElastiCache high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores such as Redis and Memcached. 
ElastiCache is used as a caching layer. It's not a fully managed NoSQL database.



 
{
 "Sid": "IPAllow",

 }
}
It authorizes an entire CIDR except one IP address to access the S3 bucket.
	
	


S3 data cannot be deleted until the regulatory time period has expired:
	Use S3 Object Lock
S3 Object Lock is an Amazon S3 feature that allows you to store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model.	
	
Use S3 Glacier Vault Lock:
	A vault is a container for storing archives on Glacier. 
	Since Vault Lock is only for Glacier and not for S3, so it cannot be used for the given use-case.



	
Batch job via a shell script:	
	Amazon EC2 is the right choice as it can accommodate batch processing and run customized scripts.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams/Lambda/Glue those cannot run custom shell scripts.
	
	
	
Stream the existing data files as well as any ongoing file updates from S3 to Kinesis Data Streams:
		Leverage AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) as a bridge between Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
	
Using Lambda functions would require significant custom development to write the data into Kinesis Data Streams,
so this option is not the right fit.

S3 cannot directly write data into SNS, although it can certainly use S3 event notifications to send an event to SNS. 
Also, SNS cannot directly send messages to Kinesis Data Streams.


	

Data loss of a few minutes without jeopardizing the forecasting models:
		Pilot Light - The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal 
		version of an environment is always running in the cloud.
		
Backup and Restore method is cheaper, it has an RPO in 1 hours, so this option is not the right fit.	
	
Warm Standby -  a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud.	
Multi-Site - A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure in an active-active configuration. 
Those 2 are option is more costly compared to Pilot Light.	
	
	
	
	
Need to scale and be highly available:	
	Set ASG minimum capacity to 2
	Use Reserved Instances for the minimum capacity
	
When we specify 2 as the minimum capacity, the ASG would create these 2 instances in separate AZs.	
Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. 	
	
	
	
	
Incurring costs that seem too high for their business requirements:	
		Use AWS Cost Explorer Resource Optimization to get a report of EC2 instances that are either 
		idle or have low utilization and use AWS Compute Optimizer to look at instance type recommendations.

AWS Cost Explorer helps you identify under-utilized EC2 instances.		
Compute Optimizer helps you choose the optimal Amazon EC2 instance types, including those that are part of an Amazon 
	EC2 Auto Scaling group, based on your utilization data. It does not recommend instance purchase options.



	
Asynchronously decouple the event-driven architecture:	
	Use Amazon EventBridge to decouple the system architecture - Both Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SNS can be used to develop 
	event-driven applications, but for this use case, EventBridge is the right fit for SaaS.

SQS is a message queuing service from amazon and works well for decoupling applications. 
It does not directly integrate with third-party SaaS services.and not for event-driven architecture.




Which is the only resource-based policy that the IAM service supports?
	Trust policy - Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role.
	
The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.
 
ACLs are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can access a resource. 
ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account.

	



Traffic will often be unpredictable:
	Set up a DynamoDB table in the on-demand capacity mode.
Amazon DynamoDB has two read/write capacity modes for processing reads and writes on your tables:

On-demand
Provisioned (default, free-tier eligible)

On-demand mode:
	You create new tables with unknown workloads.
	You have unpredictable application traffic.
	You prefer the ease of paying for only what you use.
	
Provisioned mode:
	You have predictable application traffic.
	You run applications whose traffic is consistent or ramps gradually.
	You can forecast capacity requirements to control costs.






Copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions:
	Copy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync command.
	Set up S3 batch replication to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console.
	
The aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between S3 buckets.

S3 Batch Replication provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication configuration was in place, 
objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed replication. 

S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over 
long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 
You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console.



Create a Lifecycle Policy to transition objects to S3 Standard IA using a prefix after 45 days.



Serverless with Lambad:
	Since Lambda functions can scale extremely quickly, its a good idea to deploy a CloudWatch Alarm that notifies your team 
	when function metrics such as ConcurrentExecutions or Invocations exceeds the expected threshold.

By default, Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC and hence have access to any public internet address or public AWS APIs. 
Once a Lambda function is VPC-enabled, it will need a route through a NAT gateway in a public subnet to access public resources.

If you intend to reuse code in more than one Lambda function, you should consider creating a Lambda Layer for the reusable code:
Layers let you keep your deployment package small, which makes development easier. A function can use up to 5 layers at a time. 
You can now package and deploy Lambda functions as container images.




Rest api Aurora database have been very high:
	Enable API Gateway Caching
	
You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. 
With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API. 
When you enable caching for a stage, 
API Gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds.

The default TTL value for API caching is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is 3600 seconds(1h). TTL=0 means caching is disabled.
 
Adding Aurora Read Replicas would greatly increase the cost, therefore this option is ruled out.
 

	

ALB removes an instance from its pool of healthy instances whenever it is detected as unhealthy but 
the Auto Scaling group fails to kick-in and provision the replacement instance:
	The Auto Scaling group is using EC2 based health check and the Application Load Balancer is using ALB based health check.
	
	
	
 
Migration of hundreds of terabytes of files from their on-premises data center to AmazonS3:
	Use AWS DataSync to migrate existing data to Amazon S3 and then use File Gateway to retain access to the migrated data 
	for ongoing updates from the on-premises applications
	
File Gateway can be used to move on-premises data to AWS Cloud, but it not an optimal solution for high volumes. 
Migration services such as DataSync are best suited for this purpose. 
S3 Transfer Acceleration cannot facilitate ongoing updates to the migrated files from the on-premises applications.



 
Remove sensitive details from the transactions before storing the cleansed transactions in a document database for low-latency retrieval:
	Feed the streaming transactions into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. 
	Leverage Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the cleansed transactions in DynamoDB. 
    The internal applications can consume the raw transactions off the Kinesis Data Stream.
	
The use case requires a near-real-time solution for cleansing, processing and storing the transactions, 
so using a batch process would be incorrect.

You cannot set up multiple consumers for Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams as it can dump data in a single data repository at a time,
so this option is incorrect.



Spread placement group:
	A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. 
	You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group. 
	Therefore, to deploy 15 EC2 instances in a single Spread placement group, the company needs to use 3 AZs.


Use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio files to text and Amazon Athena to understand the underlying customer sentiments.

	
	
Performance lag for the data delivery speed between producers and consumers of the data streams:
	Use Enhanced Fanout feature of Kinesis Data Streams.
You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel. 

Kinesis Data Firehose can only write to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch or Splunk. 
You can't have applications consuming data streams from Kinesis Data Firehose, that's the job of Kinesis Data Streams.

As multiple app consuming the same stream concurrently, both SQS Standard and SQS FIFO are not the right fit for the given use-case.
 
 
 
 
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException exception:
	Use batch messages
To reduce overhead and increase throughput, the application must batch records and implement parallel HTTP requests. 
This will increase the efficiency overall and ensure you are optimally using the shards.
	
Increasing shards could be a short term fix but will substantially increase the cost, so this option is ruled out.

	

RDS instance resilient from a disaster recovery perspective:
	Use cross-Region Read Replicas
	Enable the automated backup feature of Amazon RDS in a multi-AZ deployment that creates backups across multiple Regions.
	
Amazon RDS supports Cross-Region Automated Backups. Manual snapshots and Read Replicas are also supported across multiple Regions.

	
	
	
DNS alias record to point to the secondary ALB in another Region in case of failure of the primary ALB:	
	Enable an Amazon Route 53 health check.



Created a static website and then deployed it on Amazon S3 url:
	http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com
	http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com



Huge traffic spike during the upcoming Thanksgiving sale:
	Auto Scaling group scheduled action.
	
	
	
SQS queue got event whenever a new object is uploaded on S3:
	Only Standard SQS queue is allowed as an Amazon S3 event notification destination, whereas FIFO SQS queue is not allowed.
	
	
	
	
Save development time and deployment costs high-throughput request-response message pattern:
	SQS temporary queues
Amazon SQS temporary queues - Temporary queues help you save development time and deployment costs when using 
common message patterns such as request-response. You can use the Temporary Queue Client to create high-throughput, 
cost-effective, application-managed temporary queues.



Only the permitted EC2 instances can read from the EFS file system:
	Use VPC security groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system
	Use an IAM policy to control access for clients who can mount your file system with the required permissions
GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to 
protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. 
It cannot be used for access control to the EFS file system.



Instance StoreVolumes:
	You can't detach an instance store volume from one instance and attach it to a different instance.
	If you create an AMI from an instance, the data on its instance store volumes isn't preserved.
If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), data in the instance store persists.	
When you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, every block of storage in the instance store is reset. 




Runing with 'DeleteOnTermination' attribute set to True for its root EBS volume:
	Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to False using the command line - If the instance is already running, 
It is not possible to update this attribute of a running instance from the AWS console.




These three not supported by AWS Firewall Manage:
	Amazon Inspector
	Amazon GuardDuty 
	NACLs-Network Access Control Lists 
	
Using AWS Firewall Manager, you can centrally configure AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced protection, 
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups, AWS Network Firewalls, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver 
DNS Firewall rules across accounts and resources in your organization. It does not support Network ACLs as of today.





Automatically recover from the failure of an AZ:
	Create an auto-scaling group that spans across 2 AZ, which min=1, max=1, desired=1.
	So we have an ASG with desired=1, across two AZ, so that if an instance goes down, it is automatically recreated in another AZ.
	
	Create an Elastic IP and use the EC2 user-data script to attach it
	With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance 
	in your account.
	Instead ALB, to minimize costs, we must use an Elastic IP. Assign an EC2 Instance Role to perform the necessary API calls.
	
	
	

Unauthorized behavior in the future:
	Amazon GuardDuty - Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect your AWS resources, 
	including your AWS accounts and access keys. 
	GuardDuty identifies any unusual or unauthorized activity, like cryptocurrency mining or infrastructure 
	deployments in a region that has never been used. 
	
	
	
AWS Direct Connect connections with speeds greater than 1 Gbps:
	Opt for two separate Direct Connect connections terminating on separate devices in more than one Direct Connect location.
	
It is important to understand that AWS Managed VPN supports up to 1.25 Gbps throughput per VPN tunnel and does not support 
Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) for egress data path in the case of multiple AWS Managed VPN tunnels terminating on the same VGW. 
Thus, AWS does not recommend customers use AWS Managed VPN as a backup for Direct Connect connections with speeds greater than 1 Gbps.

 
 
 
S3 storage classes supports encryption by default for both data at rest as well as in-transit?
	Amazon S3 Glacier
S3 Glacier automatically encrypts data at rest using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit symmetric keys and supports 
secure transfer of your data over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

 

	
Necessary to read the first 250 bytes of each object in S3:
	Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, issue a Byte Range Fetch for the first 250 bytes, 
	and store that information in RDS.
A byte-range request is a perfect way to get the beginning of a file and ensuring we remain efficient during our scan of our S3 bucket. 

	
	
	
RDS needs to use a caching service that supports multi-threading:	
	Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached 

Choose Memcached if the following apply to you:
	You need the simplest model possible.
	You need to run large nodes with multiple cores or threads (support for multi-threading).
	You need the ability to scale out and in, adding and removing nodes as demand on your system increases and decreases.
	You need to cache objects.

ElastiCache-Redis does not support multi-threading.	
DAX does not support relational databases.

Amazon ElastiCache for Redis - Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, 
in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.

Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is an open-source, distributed, 
in-memory key-value store that can retrieve data in milliseconds.



The big data analysis job needs to read the data from Amazon S3 and output it back to S3:
	Amazon EMR 
	AWS Glue 



EBS volumes. The database is heavily I/O bound:
		Use RAID 0 when I/O performance is more important than fault tolerance.
RAID 1 when fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance.		
		
		
		
Near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss:		
	Capture data in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. Use Amazon Redshift to query the data.
						
Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to capture, transform, and load streaming data into Redshift for near real-time analytics. 
It is also an auto-scaling solution as there is no need to provision any shards like Kinesis Data Streams.

			
		
		
RDS multi-AZ during the maintenance window:		
	Any database engine level upgrade for an RDS DB instance with Multi-AZ deployment triggers both the primary and 
	standby DB instances to be upgraded at the same time. This causes downtime until the upgrade is complete.
Upgrades to the database engine level require downtime.
	

 
Custom scripts only once during the launch of the Amazon EC2:		
		Run the custom scripts as user data scripts on the Amazon EC2 instances
		
You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you 
restart your instance. By default, the scripts are run, only once during the boot process while first launching the instance.


		
		
		
As the Availability Zones got unbalanced, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will compensate by rebalancing the Availability Zones. 
When rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, 
so that rebalancing does not compromise the performance or availability of your application.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates a new scaling activity for terminating the unhealthy instance and then terminates it. 
Later, another scaling activity launches a new instance to replace the terminated instance.




Cost-optimal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) and the company does not want to manage the encryption keys:
	SSE-S3
There are no additional fees for using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).

SSE-KMS
SSE-KMS provides an option where AWS manages the encryption key on your behalf, however, this entails a usage fee for the KMS key.

Client-Side Encryption - You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. 
In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

SSE-C - You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to 
disks and decryption when you access your objects.



Wants to use the private hosted zones feature of Route 53:
	enableDnsHostnames
	enableDnsSupport

For each VPC that you want to associate with the Route 53 hosted zone, change the following VPC settings to true:
	enableDnsHostnames
	enableDnsSupport



@@@
Users from other countries denied access to these live-streamed:
Route 53 based geolocation routing policy:
		Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, 
		meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.
		
CloudFront web distribution:		
		You can use georestriction, also known as geo-blocking, to prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing 
		content that you're distributing through a CloudFront web distribution.(whitelist /blacklist)
		
		


UDP protocol and needs to support fast regional failover:
	Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for 
	HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.

Route53 is ruled out as the company wants to continue using its own custom DNS service.
ELB Regional, if user Global then AWS Global Accelerator, if user in same region use ALB or NLB.


		
	
It needs the games table to be accessible globally but needs the users and games_played tables to be regional only:		
	For the given use-case, need to have two Aurora clusters, one for the global table (games table) 
	and the other one for the local tables (users and games_played tables).


		
Need to process hot data and clod data:		
	FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as well as easily 
	store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3.



NFS interface=AWS Storage Gateway - File Gateway
Lambda integrates natively with Kinesis Data Streams.

		

AWS KMS enforces a waiting period for delete kms key:
	You can set the waiting period from a minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 30 days. The default waiting period is 30 days.



ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. 
ECS with Fargate launch type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests.



Dynamic website is hosted using on-premises servers, and its slow:
	Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.
You can use different origins for different types of content on a single site – e.g. 
Amazon S3 for static objects, Amazon EC2 for dynamic content, and custom origins for third-party content.




GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as 
	AWS CloudTrail events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.



NLB is unable to detect HTTP errors for the application:
	Replace the Network Load Balancer (NLB) with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configure HTTP health checks on the 
	ALB by pointing to the URL of the application. Leverage the Auto Scaling group to replace unhealthy instances.

Network Load Balancers use active and passive health checks to determine whether a target is available to handle requests. 
With active health checks, the load balancer periodically sends a request to each registered target to check its status.




S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files. 
But, it costs more than S3 One Zone-IA because of the redundant storage across availability zones. 
As the data is re-creatable, so you don't need to incur this additional cost.



Cost of S3 Standard < Cost of  EFS file< Cost of  EBS.



AWS Shield Advanced across multiple AWS accounts too much bill:
	Consolidated billing has not been enabled. All the AWS accounts should fall under a single consolidated billing for 
	the monthly fee to be charged only once.



S3 Versioning:
	Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. 
	Versioning can only be suspended once it has been enabled.



Hybrid cloud environment and run data-intensive analytics workloads that support DFS:
	Amazon FSx for Windows File Server:
	Amazon FSx supports the use of Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS) to organize shares into a single folder 
	structure up to hundreds of PB in size. 
 
FSx for Lustre does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS).
AWS Managed Microsoft AD does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS).
 


ElastiCache - Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is an ideal front-end for data stores like Amazon RDS or Amazon DynamoDB, 
providing a high-performance middle tier for applications with extremely high request rates and/or low latency requirements.



Wants to delegate access to a set of users from another AWS account:
	Create a new IAM role with the required permissions to access the resources in the production environment. 
	The users can then assume this IAM role while accessing the resources from the production environment.



Can be used as a boot volume:
	General Purpose SSD (gp2)
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
	Instance Store
	
	
	



Does not want to provide its own encryption keys but still wants to maintain an audit trail and key use by whom:
	Use SSE-KMS to encrypt the user data on S3.
	



API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that enable stateless client-server communication and API Gateway also creates WebSocket APIs 
that adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server.



Resilient architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance, then you should use Instance Store based EC2.



Block access from two countries and allow access only from the home country:
	Configure AWS WAF on the Application Load Balancer in a VPC.
	
 
 
RDS:
	Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. 
	Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.
	


Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis:
	API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request.
	Amazon SQS offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency.
	Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed, scalable service that can ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real-time.
	
	
	
	
	
	
Spreadsheet is saved on an EFS file system created in us-east-1 region:
	The spreadsheet on the EFS file system can be accessed in other AWS regions by using an inter-region VPC peering connection.
 
You can connect to Amazon EFS file systems from EC2 instances in other AWS regions using an inter-region VPC peering connection, 
and from on-premises servers using an AWS VPN connection. 



Regular request 100, spike touches about 5000 requests per second:
	Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda have crossed the account concurrency quota for Lambda, so the team needs to contact 
	AWS support to raise the account limit.
	
AWS Lambda currently supports 1000 concurrent executions per AWS account per region.
For more You need to contact AWS support to raise the account limit.


	

In Order 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS:
	Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate.
	
By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second).
4 messages per operation so that the FIFO queue can support up to 1200, max 10 for FIFO.


		
Enable storage auto-scaling for RDS MySQL
	If your workload is unpredictable, you can enable storage autoscaling for an Amazon RDS DB instance.



Lambda function in AWS account A that accesses an Amazon S3 bucket in AWS account B:
	Create an IAM role for the Lambda function that grants access to the S3 bucket. 
	Set the IAM role as the Lambda function's execution role. 
	Make sure that the bucket policy also grants access to the Lambda function's execution role.
	
Bucket are in different accounts, then you need to grant Amazon S3 permissions on both the IAM role and the bucket policy.

Encryption key usage must be logged for auditing purposes
Encryption Keys must be rotated every year
The data must be encrypted at rest:
	Server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) with automatic key rotation.
	
	

EC2 instances need to access  S3 and DynamoDB:
	Attach the appropriate IAM role to the EC2 instance profile so that the instance can access S3 and DynamoDB.
	
	
	

Static website  scalable serverless solution:
	Build the website as a static website hosted on Amazon S3. Create a CloudFront distribution with Amazon S3 as the origin. 
	Use Amazon Route 53 to create an alias record that points to your CloudFront distribution.
	
You can't host a website on Lambda. Also, you can't have CloudFront in front of Lambda. 	
	



Failover environment on AWS in case the on-premises data center fails:
	Set up a Route 53 failover record. 
	Run application servers on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer in an Auto Scaling group. 
	Set up AWS Storage Gateway with stored volumes to back up data to S3.
	
Storage Gateway also integrates natively with Amazon S3 cloud storage which makes your data available for in-cloud processing.


	
	
Leverage Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas and create the dev database by restoring from the 
automated backups of Amazon Aurora.
No performance impact or interruption of database service occurs as backup data is being written.



Improve the performance of its big data processing workflows running on Amazon EFS:
	Max I/O
Max I/O performance mode is used to scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second. 
Highly parallelized applications and workloads, big data analysis, media processing, and genomic analysis
 
 
Provisioned Throughput
Bursting Throughput
This two are Throughput mode of EFS and not the performance mode.





Multiple AWS accounts VPCs have been provisioned across these AWS accounts(hub-and-spoke styl):
	Build a shared services VPC
	
Sharing resources from a central location better instead of building them in each VPC, also reduce administrative overhead and cost.	
	
	


Hadoop cluster deployed in the on-premises data center highly available with about 50 EC2 instances per Availability Zone:
	Partition placement group
This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. 

Cluster placement group
low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications. 
This is not suited for distributed and replicated workloads such as Hadoop.

Spread placement group
Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. 
This is not suited for distributed and replicated workloads such as Hadoop.





Needs 80 instances 80% of the time and spike need 300 ec2:
	Purchase 80 reserved instances. 
	Provision additional on-demand and spot instances per the workload demand (Use Auto Scaling Group with launch template 
	to provision the mix of on-demand and spot instances)



User level as well as account-level access permissions for the data stored in S3 buckets:
	Use S3 Bucket Policies.	
Bucket policies can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a single bucket. 

	
	
Minimize the application boostrap time whenever the system needs to be stopped and then started:
	Use EC2 Instance Hibernate
Creating an AMI may help with all the system dependencies, but it won't help us with speeding up the application start time.




S3 Data encrypted and decrypted using the same key in both AWS regions:
	Create a new S3 bucket in the us-east-1 region with replication enabled from this new bucket into another bucket in us-west-1 region. 
	Enable SSE-KMS encryption on the new bucket in us-east-1 region by using an AWS KMS multi-region key. 
	Copy the existing data from the current S3 bucket in us-east-1 region into this new S3 bucket in us-east-1 region.
	

You can use CloudWatch Alarms to send an email via SNS whenever any of the EC2 instances breaches a certain threshold.



RDS read replicas data transfer charge:
	There are no data transfer charges for replicating data within the same Availability Zone
	There are no data transfer charges for replicating data within the same AWS Region
	There are an data transfer charges for replicating data across AWS Regions



Less frequently accessed files on AWS that can be concurrently accessed by hundreds of EC2 instances:
	Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) Standard–IA storage 
The EFS Standard storage class is used for frequently accessed files.
	


2 Hour The solution for the workload should be able to withstand server failures:
	Run the workload on a Spot Fleet
Only spot fleets can maintain target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated, 
so spot instances, by themselves, are not the right fit for this use-case.

The Spot Fleet attempts to launch the number of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances to meet the target capacity that you specified in the Spot Fleet request.



App slow down for loading on another region(eu-west-1):
	Setup another fleet of EC2 instances for the web tier in the eu-west-1 region. Enable latency routing policy in Route 53. 
	Create Amazon Aurora read replicas in the eu-west-1 region 
	
	

The auditor has its own AWS account and needs its own copy of the RDS:
	Create an encrypted snapshot of the database, share the snapshot, and allow access to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) 
	encryption key.
You can share AWS KMS CMKs with another AWS account by adding the other account to the AWS KMS key policy.



Configure an AWS DataSync agent on the on-premises server that has access to the NFS file system. 
Transfer data over the Direct Connect connection to an AWS PrivateLink interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EFS by using a private VIF. 
Set up a DataSync scheduled task to send the video files to the EFS file system every 24 hours.




DNS queries for the private hosted zone remain unresolved:
	Enable DNS hostnames and DNS resolution for private hosted zones.
	
DNS hostnames: For non-default virtual private clouds that aren't created using the Amazon VPC wizard, this option is disabled by default. 	
DNS resolution: Private hosted zones accept DNS queries only from a VPC DNS server.	



Linux Files will be stored and accessed frequently at first, and then infrequently:
	EFS IA
EFS IA for the file that not accessed every day, with storage prices up to 92% lower compared to Amazon EFS Standard.




Aurora multi-master DB cluster:
	For applications where you can't afford even brief downtime for database write operations, a multi-master cluster can help to 
	avoid an outage when a writer instance becomes unavailable.

	
	

EBS change this default behavior to ensure that the volume persists even after the instance terminates:
Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to false




Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) - 
	When you use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. 
	As key regularly rotates.
	
Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)-	
	For the given use-case, the company wants to manage the encryption keys via its custom application and let S3 manage the encryption, 
	therefore you must use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)

Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) -
	Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3. 
	SSE-KMS provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. 
	Additionally, you can create and manage customer-managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are unique to you, your service, 
	and your Region.
	
Client-Side Encryption with data encryption is done on the client-side before sending it to Amazon S3 - 
	You can encrypt the data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, 
	the encryption keys, and related tools.




CORRECT for AMIs:
	You can copy an AMI across AWS Regions.
	You can share an AMI with another AWS account.
	Copying an AMI backed by an encrypted snapshot cannot result in an unencrypted target snapshot.(encrypted-to-unencrypted = NO)



For AWS Managed IPSec VPN Connection between:
	Create a Virtual Private Gateway on the AWS side of the VPN and a Customer Gateway on the on-premises side of the VPN.
	
	
	
AWS DataSync fully automates and accelerates moving large active datasets to AWS, up to 10 times faster than command-line tools. 
It is natively integrated with Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail.
	
The AWS Transfer Family provides fully managed support for file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS. 
Therefore, it cannot support migration into the other AWS storage services mentioned in the given use-case 
(Amazon FSx for Windows File Server).



RDS read replicas should lag no more than 1 second behind the primary instance:
	Set up database migration from RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL. Swap out the MySQL read replicas with Aurora Replicas. 
	Configure Aurora Auto Scaling.

Auror The replica lag times are in the 10s of milliseconds.




For multiple High Performance Computing (HPC) workflows:
	Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate 
High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications.

Elastic Network Interface - An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a logical networking component in a 
VPC that represents a virtual network card,insufficient for HPC workflows.

Elastic Network Adapter - Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices support enhanced networking via single root I/O virtualization 
(SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities for Windows server.
Still EFA is a better fit for the given use-case because the EFA device provides all the functionality of an ENA device, plus OS bypass.




Instances in a public subnet and IDs as the targets for the NLB:
	Traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance.
So elastic IP address or public IP address cannot be used to route the traffic to the instance.





VPC peering facilitates a connection between two VPCs within the AWS network, therefore this option cannot be used to 
send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.
Use VPN CloudHub for connect multiple remote office branch.




Three AZ with public and private subnet:
	Set up three NAT gateways, one in each public subnet in each AZ. Create a custom route table for each AZ that 
	forwards non-local traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
	
	


Real-time processing with manage service:
	Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data, process it using AWS Lambda or run analytics using Kinesis Data Analytics.





The database rollover will archive:
	Schedule a weekly EventBridge event cron expression to invoke a Lambda function that runs the database rollover job.
	
	
	

NAT instance supports port forwarding.
NAT instance can be used as a bastion server.
Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance.





DynamoDB table. As soon as the issue is detected, the team needs to remove the corrupted:
	Use DynamoDB point in time recovery to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data was written.
	
	

Complex with too many ALBs in multiple AWS Regions, firewall need to reduce IP:
	Launch AWS Global Accelerator and create endpoints for all the Regions. 
	Register the ALBs of each Region to the corresponding endpoints.
	
	
	
	
EBS:
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
	50 IOPS/GB to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS and provide up to 1,000 MB/s of throughput per volume.

	General Purpose SSD (gp2) -
	It supports max IOPS/Volume of 16,000.

	Cold HDD (sc1) IOPS/Volume of 250.

	Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) It supports max IOPS/Volume of 500.




Amazon FSx for Windows File Server - Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed, highly reliable file storage 
that is accessible over the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

Storage Gateway provides 4 types of storage interfaces: File, Volume, and Tape and FSx For Windows
The File Gateway enables you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using file protocols NFS and SMB.




Wants a solution that can handle complex database configurations such as secondary indexes, foreign keys, and stored procedures:
	AWS Schema Conversion Tool
	AWS Database Migration Service




Use Amazon GuardDuty to monitor any malicious/unauthorized activity on data stored in S3. 
Use Amazon Macie to identify any sensitive data stored on S3.





Use AZ ID to uniquely identify the Availability Zones across the two AWS Accounts:
If you share a subnet in the Availability Zone with the AZ ID usw2-az2 with another account, this subnet is available to 
that account in the Availability Zone whose AZ ID is also usw2-az2.




Application will be accessed by users from different geographic regions of the world, latency for a great user experience:
	Use Amazon S3 for hosting the web application and use S3 Transfer Acceleration to reduce the latency that geographically 
	dispersed users might face.





Single AWS Acc multiple VPC need to connect:
	VPc Peering.
You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. 
The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection). 
VPC Peering helps connect two VPC.




Kinesis will be great for event streaming from the IoT devices, for sending notifications SNS.




CloudFront:
	CloudFront can route to multiple origins based on the content type
	Use an origin group with primary and secondary origins to configure CloudFront for high availability and failover.
	Use field level encryption in CloudFront to protect sensitive data for specific content.
	
	
	
	
You can host multiple TLS secured applications, each with its own TLS certificate, behind a single load balancer. 
Use SSL certificates with SNI	
	
	
	

Maximum possible availability for the database layer while minimizing operational and management overhead:	
Migrate the data to Amazon RDS for SQL Server database in a Multi-AZ deployment
Amazon RDS supports Multi-AZ deployments for Microsoft SQL Server by using either SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or 
Always On Availability Groups (AGs). 
	
	
	
	
For dister recovery currently takes over 45 minutes to install on a Linux system:
		Create an AMI after installing the software and copy the AMI across all Regions. 
		Use this Region-specific AMI to run the recovery process in the respective Regions.
		
AWS does not copy launch permissions, user-defined tags, or Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI. 
After the copy operation is complete, you can apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and Amazon S3 bucket
permissions to the new AMI.




Check S3 buckets settings being changed regularly:
	Use CloudTrail to analyze API calls
	
	
	
	
Improve the VPN throughpu:
	Create a transit gateway with equal cost multipath routing and add additional VPN tunnels.
 
 
		
RDS specific best practices are incorporated into a reusable infrastructure template to be used by all your AWS users:
	Use CloudFormation to manage RDS databases.
	
AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, 
in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. 

 
	
Highly available cost-effect:
	Set the minimum capacity to 2
	Use Reserved Instances for the minimum capacity
	
	
	
Leverage Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to capture the data from the website and feed it into Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics 
which can query the data in real time. 
Lastly, the analyzed feed is output into Kinesis Data Firehose to persist the data on Amazon S3.



EC2 instance and the EBS volume are under-utilized:	
		Convert the Amazon EC2 instance EBS volume to gp2.

Therefore, gp2 is the right choice as it is more cost-effective than io1, and it also allows a burst in performance when needed.


	
The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role Trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.




Dynamically alter the size of a geographic area from which traffic is routed to a specific server resource:	
	Geoproximity routing - Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location 
	of your users and your resources. 
	You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias.
	
	
	
	
EC2 take huse time to run, make it lessthen 2 miute:
	Create a Golden AMI with the static installation components already setup.
	Use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time.


	
Opt for Multi-AZ configuration with automatic failover functionality to help mitigate failure - Multi-AZ is the best option when 
data retention, minimal downtime, and application performance are a priority.
Data-loss potential - Low. Multi-AZ provides fault tolerance for every scenario, including hardware-related issues.



VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub:	
	Use AWS Transit Gateway to connect the Amazon VPCs to the on-premises networks.
	
	
	

ELB in a Region malfunctioned:
	Set up AWS Global Accelerator and add endpoints to cater to users in different geographic locations.
	


HIPAA compliant in-memory database that supports SQL query:
	ElastiCache for Redis/Memcached
Both ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached are HIPAA Eligible.	
	
	
	
	
No IAM user with AdministratorAccess:
	Some of the AWS tasks that only a root account user can do are as follows: change account name or 
	root password or root email address, change AWS support plan, close AWS account, enable MFA on S3 bucket delete, 
	create Cloudfront key pair, register for GovCloud. 


	
RDS primary instance of the Multi-AZ configuration goes down:	
		When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, 
		which is in turn promoted to become the new primary. 
	
Amazon RDS uses several different technologies to provide failover support. 
Multi-AZ deployments for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances use Amazon's failover technology. 
SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs).


	
	
Then,the instance has to be manually restarted, for auto:
		Setup a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the health status of the instance. In case of an Instance Health Check failure, 
		an EC2 Reboot CloudWatch Alarm Action can be used to reboot the instance.
		
Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances. 		
		
		
		
Historical data (any data older than a year) into S3, as the daily analytical reports:	
		Use Redshift Spectrum to create Redshift cluster tables pointing to the underlying historical data in S3. 
		The analytics team can then query this historical data to cross-reference with the daily reports from Redshift.
		
		
		
Test databases that must be re-created from production Aurora data.		
		Use database cloning to create multiple clones of the production DB and use each clone as a test DB.
		
		
		
High IOPS. The team wants to install the database on an EC2 instance with the optimal storage type:		
Amazon EC2 with EBS volume of Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) type.



S3 low transfrer speed offices in remote location:
	Use Amazon CloudFront distribution with origin as the S3 bucket. 
	This would speed up uploads as well as downloads for the video files.
	Enable Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration for the S3 bucket. This would speed up uploads as well as downloads for the video files.
	
	
A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. 
Amazon S3 always returns the latest version of the object.




Directed to a static error page, configured as a backup, in case of unavailability of the primary website:
Set up a Route 53 active-passive type of failover routing policy. 
If Route 53 health check determines the ALB endpoint as unhealthy, the traffic will be diverted to a static error page.



Metadata, which can be included with the object, is not encrypted while being stored on Amazon S3. 
Therefore, AWS recommends that customers not place sensitive information in Amazon S3 metadata.




Wants to continue using their existing encryption key generation mechanism:
	SSE-C - With Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys and Amazon 
	S3 manages the encryption.
	
	


Distributed in-memory cache-based session management solution:
	ElastiCache can be used as a distributed in-memory cache for session management. 
	
	
	
High-performance IOPS when doing file processing in a temporary storag:
	Use EC2 instances with Instance Store as the storage type
	
	
	
Show Best practices on cost optimization, performance, and security for their system:	
	AWS Trusted Advisor
	
	
VPCs in a hub and spoke model:	
		Use a Transit gateway to interconnect the VPCs.
		
		
DynamoDB encryption details are nowhere in CloudTrails:
	By default, all DynamoDB tables are encrypted under an AWS owned customer master key (CMK), 
	which do not write to CloudTrail logs.
All DynamoDB tables are encrypted. There is no option to enable or disable encryption for new or existing tables.
	
	
	
Flexible nightly process which runs for 1 hour using Python:
	Run on a Spot Instance with Spot Block

Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are designed not to be interrupted and will run continuously 
for the duration you select. This makes them ideal for jobs that take a finite time to complete, 
such as batch processing, encoding and rendering, modeling and analysis, and continuous integration.



ELB cannot distribute incoming traffic for targets deployed in different regions. 


Create an S3 Event Notification that sends a message to an SQS queue. Make the EC2 instances read from the SQS queue.

 
		
EFs access control such that only the permitted EC2:	
	Use VPC security groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system
	Use an IAM policy to control access for clients who can mount your file system with the required permissions
You control which EC2 instances can access your EFS file system by using VPC security group rules and AWS Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) policies. 
Use VPC security groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system. 



Set up an on-premises file gateway. Configure data sources to write the .json files to the file gateway. 
Point the legacy analytics application to the file gateway. The file gateway should replicate the .json files to Amazon S3.




Automatically recover from the failure of an AZ:
	Create an auto-scaling group that spans across 2 AZ, which min=1, max=1, desired=1
	Assign an EC2 Instance Role to perform the necessary API calls
	Create an Elastic IP and use the EC2 user-data script to attach it.	
	
So we have an ASG with desired=1, across two AZ, so that if an instance goes down, it is automatically recreated in another AZ.



Dynamic port mapping with an Application Load Balancer makes it easier to run multiple tasks on the same 
	Amazon ECS service on an Amazon ECS cluster.


Encrypted using the company's proprietary algorithm:
	Client Side Encryption



Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volumes - Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) 
volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone. 

General-purpose SSD-based EBS volumes not supported for Multi-Attach functionality.




ElastiCache for Redis supports replication and archival snapshots right out of the box. 
ElastiCache for Memcached does not support replication and archival snapshots, so this option is ruled out.	
	
	
	
Not able to modify AWS CloudTrail configuration:	
		Set up a service control policy (SCP) that prohibits changes to CloudTrail, and attach it to the developer accounts.
		
		
IOPS on the EBS volume is maxing out. The disk size of the database must not change because of a licensing issue:		
		Convert the gp2 volume to an io1
The only solution is to convert the volume into an io1 volume. 
This will allow us to keep the same disk size while independently increasing the IOPS for that volume.
		
		
		
	
	
Using SQS as a middleware will help us sustain the write throughput scale infinitely.	
Kinesis Data Streams cannot scale infinitely and we may have the same throughput issues. 	
	
	

High levels of inter-node communications and HPC:
	Deploy EC2 instances with Elastic Fabric Adapter
	Deploy EC2 instances in a cluster placement group
	
	


Create a separate gateway endpoint for S3 and DynamoDB each. 
Add two new target entries for these two gateway endpoints in the route table of the custom VPC.



Create two SQS standard queues: one for pro and one for lite. 
Set up EC2 instances to prioritize polling for the pro queue over the lite queue.



Aurora Serverless is the perfect way to create a database that can scale down to 0 servers, 
and scale up to many servers, as an OLTP database.





	
Archive the on-premises data into a POSIX and accessed for just about a week in a year.:
	EFS Infrequent Access
S3 not POSIX compliant file storage solution. 	
	



Leverage horizontal scaling for the web and application tiers by using ASG and ALB.
	
	
	

EC2 instance needs to access a DynamoDB table in the same AWS account:
	Set up an IAM service role with the appropriate permissions to allow access to the DynamoDB table. 
	Configure an instance profile to assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
	
	
	
High-frequency reading and writing:
	Use Amazon EFS with Provisioned Throughput mode
	
	
	

A Big Data company wants to optimize its daily Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process serverless:
	AWS Glue - AWS Glue provides a managed ETL service that runs on a serverless Apache Spark environment.
	
	
Customizations to the underlying Oracle database as well as its host operating system (OS):
	Leverage multi-AZ of RDS Custom for Oracle that allows the database administrators to access and customize with OS.
	



Collaborate on this spreadsheet:
	The spreadsheet on the EFS file system can be accessed in other AWS regions by using an inter-region VPC peering connection.
	
Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, regions, and VPCs, while on-premises servers can access 
using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.
You can connect to Amazon EFS file systems from EC2 instances in other AWS regions using an inter-region VPC peering connection, 
and from on-premises servers using an AWS VPN connection.




Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using ElastiCache Redis as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements.
Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) as it meets the in-memory, 
high availability, low latency requirements.




100 requests per second. During the peak football season, the rate touches about 5000 requests per second:
	Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda have crossed the account concurrency quota for Lambda, 
	so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit
		
AWS Lambda default currently supports 1000  executions per AWS account per region. 






NewErr
@@@


Files that are older than 2 years must be stored in a different storage class:
	Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier after 2 years.
	
Not Amazon EFS-IA after 2 years, the maximum days for the EFS lifecycle policy is only 90 days as retaion priod number. 
The requirement is to move the files that are older than 2 years or 730 days.


Although CloudFront delivers content faster to your users using edge locations, you still cannot integrate DynamoDB table with CloudFront as these two are incompatible.



Amazon AppFlow is integration service for transferring data securely between SaaS applications and AWS service.
like Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, ServiceNow.




EFS lifecycle management doesn’t delete objects. It can only transition files in and out of the “Infrequent Access” tier.




The application has an embedded NoSQL database. As the application receives more traffic, the application becomes overloaded mainly due to database requests. The management wants to ensure that the database is eventually consistent and highly available.

Configure the Auto Scaling group to spread the Amazon EC2 instances across three Availability Zones. Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with a replication server and an ongoing replication task to migrate the embedded NoSQL database to Amazon DynamoDB.





Although an active/standby Amazon MQ setup provides better availability than a single-instance deployment, it still takes a short time to take the inactive instance out of service and replace it with the standby instance. 
In Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ, a cluster broker deployment setup is recommended to ensure high availability. 
The active/standby architecture is commonly used for Amazon MQ for the ActiveMQ variant.




EBS volume is a storage area network (SAN) storage and not a POSIX-compliant shared file system. You have to use EFS instead.
EBS Volume snapshots are actually sent to Amazon S3.

hTTP AND hTTPS FOR ALB
A TCP,UDP health check is only offered in Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers.
 
 
On-premises credentials, which is stored in Active Directory. 
	Set up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS).

Setting up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Web Identity Federation is incorrect because this is primarily used to let users sign in via a well-known external identity provider (IdP), such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google. It does not utilize Active Directory.




1200 employees would be granted access to use Amazon S3:
	Configure an IAM role and an IAM Policy to access the bucket.
	Set up a Federation proxy or an Identity provider, and use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary tokens.



Amazon Cognito is used for single sign-on in mobile and web applications. 
You don’t have to use it if you already have an existing Directory Service to be used for authentication.



Integrate CloudFront with Lambda@Edge in order to process the data in close geographical proximity to users and respond to user requests at low latencies. 
Process real-time streaming data using Kinesis and durably store the results to an Amazon S3 bucket.



Instance store volumes have greater I/O performance than EBS volumes.
S3 Transfer Acceleration is mainly used to speed up the transfer of gigabytes or terabytes of data between clients and an S3 bucket.


Backlog per instance: To determine your backlog per instance, start with the Amazon SQS metric ApproximateNumberOfMessages.



You cannot set up an Active-Active Failover with One Primary and One Secondary Resource. 
Remember that an Active-Active Failover uses all available resources all the time without a primary nor a secondary resource.


UDP is not supported in Application Load Balancer. 
UDP is a Layer 4 traffic. Therefore, you should use a Network Load Balancer.
You can’t assign an Elastic IP address to an Application Load Balancer.



EC2 detailed monitoring does not provide metrics for memory usage, detailed monitoring just provides a higher frequency of metrics (1-minute frequency). 
CloudWatch does not monitor memory usage.
Install the CloudWatch unified agent to the EC2 instances. Set up a custom parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with the CloudWatch agent configuration to create an aggregated metric on memory usage percentage. 
Scale the Auto Scaling group based on the aggregated metri.





Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account.
Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account

You can use an IAM role to delegate access to resources that are in different AWS accounts that you own,
Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

It does not assist in maintaining governance over your AWS accounts. Additionally, the AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor simply allows you to add, edit, and delete tags to multiple AWS resources at once for easier identification and monitoring.





Attach the kms:decrypt permission to the Lambda function’s execution role. Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s execution role the kms:decrypt permission.

Like the other incorrect option, the decrypt permission must be added to the function’s execution role and not on its resource policy.



Take note that FTP uses TCP and not UDP.
Public Data Set is incorrect due to the fact that Amazon stores the data sets at no charge to the community.


Using Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to store the data is incorrect. Although this provides the most cost-effective storage solution, it is not the appropriate service to use if the files being stored are frequently accessed every week.


Configure a VPC peering connection between AWS accounts and associate it with Direct Connect gateway is incorrect because VPC peering is not supported in a Direct Connect connection. VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships.



1200 employees would be granted access to use Amazon S3:
– Setup a Federation proxy or an Identity provider
– Setup an AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary tokens 
– Configure an IAM role and an IAM Policy to access the bucket. 




Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 second and a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 1 minute:
	Amazon Aurora Global Database



Use AWS LakeFormation to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account.



Uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The minimum ECS task count is initially set to 1:
Set up an Amazon EventBridge rule to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to the ECS cluster to run a new ECS task.

You can use Amazon EventBridge to run Amazon ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur. 
you can’t directly set CloudWatch Alarms to update the ECS task count.




Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the --transit-encryption-enabled and --auth-token parameters enabled.


Ability to immediately remove the key material from AWS KMS. The solution should also be able to audit the key usage:
	Use AWS Key Management Service to create a CMK in a custom key store and store the non-extractable key material in AWS CloudHSM.
	
To immediately remove the key material from AWS KMS, you can use a custom key store.

requires you to have full control over the encryption of the created key. AWS-owned CMKs and AWS-managed CMKs are managed by AWS. Moreover, these options do not allow you to audit the key usage independently of AWS CloudTrail.




AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS Organization. 
You can share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License Manager configurations, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules resources with RAM.



CloudTrail and CloudWatch Alarm can’t directly set update the ECS task count.
EventBridge can directly target an ECS task on the Targets section when you create a new rule.


AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect because this service is more suitable for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses and fast regional failover. 
Moreover, there is no direct way that you can integrate AWS Global Accelerator with Amazon S3. 
It’s more suitable to use Amazon CloudFront instead in this scenario.



Systems Manager Parameter Store doesn’t rotate its parameters.
Secrets Manager enables, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to the schedule that you specify day. 



The S3 Object Lock feature allows you to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. In the scenario, changes to objects are allowed, but their previous versions should be preserved and remain retrievable. If you enable the S3 Object Lock feature, you won’t be able to upload new versions of an object. This feature is only helpful when you want to prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.


Amazon AppStream 2.0 offers secure, reliable, and scalable access to non-persistent desktops and applications from any location.



ELB is regional services, ELB is designed to only run in one region and not across multiple regions.


The company has new AWS accounts that will also require consistent and dedicated access:
	Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.


Create CloudWatch alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions.

Take note that FTP uses TCP and not UDP.
UDP is not supported in Application Load Balancer. Remember that UDP is a Layer 4 traffic. Therefore, you should use a Network Load Balancer.



Use an AWS DataSync agent to rapidly move the data over a service endpoint.
There is no AWS config “managed rule” that checks for service quotas.



Trusted Advisor APIs:
	This API returns information about all available AWS Trusted Advisor checks, so it will be difficult to extract only “service limits” information from this API call. 
Moreover, the Trusted Advisor APIs (AWS Support APIs) are only available for Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plans.
Not in Developer support plan.




EC2 instances inside two custom VPCs transfer data:
	– Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs.
	– Re-configure the route table’s target and destination of the instances’ subnet.


The EBS volume can be used while the snapshot is in progress.



EC2 instance takes 1 minute to boot up before it can respond to user requests:
	Create a step scaling policy and configure an instance warm-up time condition.



Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies.Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).
Amazon EC2 provides enhanced networking capabilities through the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA).

RDS: Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU and OS.


Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the --transit-encryption-enabled and --auth-token parameters enabled.


Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard




Read replication latency of less than 1 second:
	Migrate the existing MySQ database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region read replica.
MySQL replicas won’t provide you a read replication latency of less than 1 second. RDS Read Replicas can only provide asynchronous replication in seconds and not in milliseconds. 




EFS service can be used for HPC applications and POSIX, it doesn’t natively work with Amazon S3. 
Amazon FSx for Lustre also POSIX complate/interface working with S3.



S3 improve the query performance while ensuring data security:
	Transform the JSON data into Apache Parque format. Ensure that the user has an lakeformation:GetDataAccess IAM permission for underlying data access control.
	
	

ALB target group’s CPU utilization is too high is incorrect. 
AWS Auto Scaling does not support this metric for ALB. You cannot track nor view the CPU utilization of an ALB.




Key points are “ingest and analyze the data in real-time” and “millisecond response times db”:
	Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Amazon Redshift only delivers sub-second response times. 





Notified  before 30 days the expiration of the SSL certificates:
	Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule and schedule it to run every day to identify the expiring ACM certificates. Configure to rule to check the DaysToExpiry metric of all ACM certificates in Amazon CloudWatch. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.
	
	Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check AWS Health or ACM expiration events related to ACM certificates. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.





AWS Backup only works for AWS resources, not with on-permise.


ElasticBeanstalk:
can automatically handle all the tasks such as balancing load, auto-scaling, monitoring, and placing your containers across your cluster:
	While you can deploy the infrastructure for your application thru CloudFormation templates, you will be the one responsible for connecting the AWS resources needed to build your application environment. With ElasticBeanstalk, all you have to do is upload your code; ElasticBeanstalk will automatically set up the environment for your application.




RDS synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) that is in the same region and not in a different one.



CloudTrail identify whether a log file has been tampered with:
	Enable the CloudTrail Log File Validation feature on all trails.

To determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered it, you can use CloudTrail log file integrity validation.




Prometheus is used to collect container metrics. Grafana uses Prometheus for its data queries to generate visualizations of the collected metrics.


Enable AWS Compute Optimizer to see recommendations on optimal sizing of compute-related resources. 


Track the migration of each application to the cloud:
	Use AWS Application Discovery Service and deploy the discovery connector to the on-premises data center to create an inventory of virtual machines to be migrated. Use the AWS Migration Hub console to track the migration of each application.




You cannot set a priority to individual items in the SQS queue.
	Create an SQS queue for free members and another one for premium members. Configure your EC2 instances to consume messages from the premium queue first and if it is empty, poll from the free members' SQS queue.



Unable to remove or modify any rules in AWS Config:
	This solution just monitors changes on AWS Config rules; it does not restrict permissions,  use SCP.
	
SCP can only be attached to the organization root, to an organizational unit (OU), or directly to an account, but not directly in the IAM User. 
Take note that the scenario explicitly mentioned that the company is using a single AWS account and not multiple AWS Accounts under a single AWS Organization.



DynamoDB Auto Scaling uses the AWS Application Auto Scaling service to dynamically adjust provisioned throughput capacity on your behalf.



Elastic Beanstalk,  not for  VPC, RDS, and IAM.


Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.


Reduce the number of IP addresses:
	Use AWS Global Accelerator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer from each region to the corresponding endpoint group.




RDS Read Replicas can only provide asynchronous replication in seconds and not in milliseconds. 
You have to use Amazon Aurora replicas for less then a second.



S3 Glacier Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5 – 12 hours. S3 Glacier Deep Archive 48 Hour.


Developers won’t be able to launch new instances once the licenses are exhausted:
	Define licensing rules on AWS License Manager to track and control license usage. Enable the option to “Enforce license limit” to prevent going over the number of allocated licenses. Add an Amazon SNS topic to send notifications and alerts.

AWS License Manager is a service that makes it easier for you to manage your software licenses from software vendors (for example, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM) centrally across AWS and your on-premises environments. This provides control and visibility into the usage of your licenses, enabling you to limit licensing overages and reduce the risk of non-compliance and misreporting.


The AWS Organizations service neither has the capability to build a landing zone nor a built-in dashboard for continuous detection of policy non-conformance and non-compliant resources across the enterprise. Use AWS Control Tower.



Faster Regional Failover:
	Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.

Route 53 is ruled out as the company wants to continue using its own custom DNS service.




Use an Amazon Aurora Global Database for the games table and use Amazon Aurora for the users and games_played tables
Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions. 


Aurora Global Database:
	Global Database allows a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions, enabling high performance of globally distributed applications.
	
	Aurora is RDS, Multi region, single master, primary +cross region read replica.
	Active-Passive, Replica can promoted to primary wihtin 1 munute.
	 
DynamoDB global table:
	When you create a DynamoDB global table, it consists of multiple replica tables (one per AWS Region) that DynamoDB treats as a single unit. Every replica has the same table name and the same primary key schema. When an application writes data to a replica table in one Region, DynamoDB propagates the write to the other replica tables in the other AWS Regions automatically.
    
	NoSQL, Mult-region, .Mult-master.
	Active-Active, High availability, sub-millisecond.
	
	


GuardDuty service:
	Disable the service in the general settings, to delete all data.
	Suspend the service in the general settings stop emediat services.




Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Firehose and use an intermediary Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream before the output is dumped on S3.
	Kinesis Data Streams cannot directly write the output to S3. Unlike Firehose.
	Kinesis Data Analytics cannot directly ingest data from the source as it ingests data either from Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose.
Firehose cannot directly write into a DynamoDB table, so this option is incorrect.




EC2 with ALB and CloudFront decouple the user authentication process:
	Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your Application Load Balancer.
	
Application-specific user authentication can be provided via Cognito User Pools. 
Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token.

You cannot directly integrate Cognito User Pools with CloudFront distribution as you have to create a separate Lambda@Edge function to accomplish the authentication via Cognito User Pools. This involves additional development effort.

You cannot use Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication, so this option is not correct.




Workload, running for about 2 hours,  should be able to withstand server failures:
Only spot fleets can maintain target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated, so spot instances, by themselves, are not the right fit for this use-case.


Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

Notify 30 days before the certificate expiration (least amount of scripting and maintenance effort):
	Leverage AWS Config managed rule to check if any third-party SSL/TLS certificates imported into ACM are marked for expiration within 30 days. Configure the rule to trigger an SNS notification to the security team if any certificate expires within 30 days

AWS Config managed rule can check if any ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within the specified number of days.

CloudWatch metrics and EventBridge events are enabled for all certificates that are managed by ACM.
EventBridge expiry event is published for any certificate that is at least 45 days away from expiry by default. 

It is certainly possible to use the days to expiry CloudWatch metric to build a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the imported ACM certificates. The alarm will, in turn, trigger a notification to the security team. But this option needs more configuration effort than directly using the AWS Config managed rule that is available off-the-shelf.

SSL/TLS certificates created via ACM do not need any monitoring/intervention for expiration. ACM automatically renews such certificates. 




Write a one time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to S3 and then modify the application to use Amazon S3 standard for storing the videos.
Mount EFS on all EC2 instances. Write a one time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to EFS. Modify the application to use EFS for storing the videos.




DB cannot afford any downtime:
	Set up an Aurora multi-master DB cluster.
For applications where you can't afford even brief downtime for database write operations, a multi-master cluster can help to avoid an outage when a writer instance becomes unavailable. The multi-master cluster doesn't use the failover mechanism, because it doesn't need to promote another DB instance to have read/write capability.	
	

Aurora serverless DB cluster
Aurora provisioned DB cluster
Aurora Global Database cluster
These three options represent Aurora single-master clusters, there is a brief downtime during this failover.




Log processed in a serverless fashion and then durably stored:
	Kinesis Data Firehose

Using an EMR cluster would imply managing the underlying infrastructure so it’s ruled out.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, As it requires manual administration of shards.




Multiple account in a single region all EC2 instances in all these accounts can communicate privately:
	Create a VPC in an account and share one or more of its subnets with the other accounts using Resource Access Manager.
	
You can share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License Manager configurations, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules resources with RAM. RAM eliminates the need to create duplicate resources in multiple accounts.

With Multple Account VPC peering connections will work, but won't efficiently scale if you add more accounts (you'll have to create many connections).
Transit Gateway is a service that enables customers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single gateway. A Transit Gateway will work but will be an expensive solution.




SCP:
	If a user or role has an IAM permission policy that grants access to an action that is either not allowed or explicitly denied by the applicable SCPs, the user or role can't perform that action.

	SCPs affect all users and roles in attached accounts, including the root user.

	SCPs do not affect service-linked role.

SCP can restrictions even override the administrators of member accounts and all user and role in the organization.

	app.covid19survey.com to app.covid19survey.net
	
ALIES: 
	covid19survey.com to www.covid19survey.com
	
	
	
DNS queries for any resources in the on-premises network from the AWS VPC:
	Create an inbound endpoint on Route 53 Resolver and then DNS resolvers on the on-premises network can forward DNS queries to Route 53 Resolver via this endpoint.

	Create an outbound endpoint on Route 53 Resolver and then Route 53 Resolver can conditionally forward queries to resolvers on the on-premises network via this endpoint.
	
	

Continuously replicate this data to ReadShift without Manage Infrastructure:
	Use AWS Database Migration Service to replicate the data from different databases into Amazon Redshift.

	AWS Glue involves significant development efforts.	
	Using EMR involves significant infrastructure management efforts.	




WAF can apply to protect http and https req for:
	Application Load Balancer
	Amazon CloudFront distribution
	Amazon API Gateway REST API
	AWS AppSync GraphQL API
	Amazon Cognito user pool

Security Group cannot be associated with a CloudFront distribution, use AWS WAF ACL and use an IP match condition.




Less RTO Aurora Global Database:
	RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL For a failover, read replicas have to be manually promoted to a standalone database instance since the process is not automatic. Hence, the RTO will be quite high

	DynamoDB global tables provide cross-region active-active capabilities with high performance no failover concept.
	DynamoDB global tables is a much costlier solution than Aurora Global Database.
Global Database allows a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions, enabling high performance of globally distributed applications.


Database rollovers for a MySQL database server using a serverless cron job:
Weekly database rollovers for a MySQL database, Python script take 5mm:
	Schedule a weekly EventBridge event cron expression to invoke a Lambda function that runs the database rollover job.
	



Use VPC sharing to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations.

VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them.
AWS owner account cannot share the VPC itself with another AWS account.




Storage Gateway provides 4 types of storage interfaces for on-premises applications: 
	File,FSx File Gateway(Windows), Volume, and Tape. 
The File Gateway enables you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).

EBS does not support SMB protocol.
S3 does not support SMB protocol.
EFS uses the Network File System protocol and POSIX-compliant. EFS does not support SMB protocol.
FSx for Luster is HPC POSIX-compliant, directly working on S3.





Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are designed not to be interrupted 
duration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours.




Capture the clickstream events from the source and then provide a concurrent feed of the data stream to the downstream applications:
	AWS Kinesis Data Streams
	
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is recommended when you need the ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. 

Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores, therefore this option is incorrect.
Kinesis Data Analytics is used to build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications, therefore this option is incorrect.
SQS, you cannot have the same message being consumed by multiple consumers at the same time.



AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying large amounts of data to and from AWS storage services over the internet or AWS Direct Connect.
(natively integrated with Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail)
as well as detailed monitoring of the transfer.

AWS Transfer Family provides fully managed support for file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS only. 



Users from different geographic regions upload large file more then 1GB:
	Use Amazon S3 for hosting the web application and use S3 Transfer Acceleration to reduce the latency that geographically dispersed users.
	
If you have objects that are smaller than 1GB or if the data set is less than 1GB in size, you should consider using Amazon CloudFront's PUT/POST commands for optimal performance. 
The given use case has data larger than 1GB and hence S3 Transfer Acceleration is a better option.



A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata.

If your instance has a public IPv4 address, it retains the public IPv4 address after recovery.and same palacement group.

During instance recovery, the instance is migrated during an instance reboot, and any data that is in-memory is lost.




Tape Gateway stores your virtual tapes in S3 buckets managed by the AWS Storage Gateway service, so you don’t have to manage your own Amazon S3 storage.

DataSync supports only NFS and SMB file types and hence is not woking with Tap backup, use Tape Gatewa.



RDS PostgreSQL DB uses AWS KMS for encrypting data at rest required, transit secure:
IAM authentication is just another way to authenticate the user's credentials while accessing the database. It would not significantly enhance the security in a way that enabling SSL does by facilitating the in-transit encryption for the database.
	Configure RDS to use SSL for data in transit.
	
For MySQL, you launch the MySQL client using the --ssl_ca parameter to reference the public key to encrypt connections.
Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and your PostgreSQL DB instances. 
You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL.




Network Load Balancers expose a fixed IP to the public web, therefore allowing your application to be predictably reached using these IPs, while allowing you to scale your application behind the Network Load Balancer using an ASG.

Network Load Balancers don't support security groups.
Application and Classic Load Balancers expose a fixed DNS (=URL) rather than the IP address.
Network Load Balancers expose a fixed IP to the public web.



Requst unpredictable during day hours and traffic spikes occur:
	Set up a DynamoDB table in the on-demand capacity mode.
DynamoDB on-demand is a flexible billing option capable of serving thousands of requests per second without capacity planning.
If you choose provisioned mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you require for your application. 	
	



CloudFront can route to multiple origins based on the content type.
Use an origin group with primary and secondary origins to configure CloudFront for high availability and failover.
Use field level encryption in CloudFront to protect sensitive data for specific content.


Installation and contains both static as well as dynamic files:
	Create a Golden AMI with the static installation components already setup 
	se EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time


Trust policy:
	IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role Trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.



Maximize the VPN throughput:
	Create a transit gateway with equal cost multipath routing and add additional VPN tunnels.
	
Transfer Acceleration is an Amazon S3 bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket,It not relevant to AWS VPN connections.

A virtual private gateway does not support equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing, so this option is incorrect.



Snow Family offers clustering feature:
Both AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized and AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized offer the storage clustering feature.



Copy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync command
Set up S3 batch replication to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console

You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console.



AWS Secrets Manager enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. 
	SSM Parameter Store cannot be used to automatically rotate the database credentials.
	Systems Manager cannot be used to store your secrets securely and automatically rotate the database credentials.


AMIs are Region-specific and need to be copied to all Regions they are intended to be used in.




EC2  manually restarted via the AWS management console:
	Setup a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the health status of the instance. In case of an Instance Health Check failure, an EC2 Reboot CloudWatch Alarm Action can be used to reboot the instance.
EventBridge event for ECS task count update.


Traffic spike during the upcoming Thanksgiving sale:
	Auto Scaling group scheduled action.
On Sheduled scaling, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. 
	
Both the target tracking as well as Step scaling policies depend on a Target value or threshold wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. 	



The Auto Scaling group is using EC2 based health check and the ALB is using ALB based (in-built)health check.
ALB cannot use EC2 based health checks.
It is recommended to use ALB based health checks for both ASG and ALB. then you will be able to avoid the scenario.




Create a replica Aurora instance in another Availability Zone to improve the availability as the replica can serve as a failover target.
There are no standby instances in Aurora. 
Aurora performs an automatic failover to a read replica when a problem is detected.

You can also make an existing Aurora cluster into a Multi-AZ cluster by adding a new reader instance and specifying a different Availability Zone.



All DynamoDB tables are encrypted. There is no option to enable or disable encryption for new or existing tables. By default, all tables are encrypted under an AWS owned customer master key (CMK) in the DynamoDB service account. However, you can select an option to encrypt some or all of your tables under a customer-managed CMK or the AWS managed CMK for DynamoDB in your account.


Use S3 Glacier vault to store the sensitive archived data and then use a vault lock policy to enforce compliance controls.
Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. 
It cannot be used to enforce compliance controls. User S3 Glacier Volt Lick. 



Using Route 53 DNS Failover, you can run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world and failover across regions.



EBS Encryption:
	Data at rest inside the volume is encrypted
	Any snapshot created from the volume is encrypted
	Data moving between the volume and the instance is encrypted





RDS for the PostgreSQL DB digister recovery:
	Use cross-Region Read Replicas
	Enable the automated backup feature of Amazon RDS in a multi-AZ deployment that creates backups across multiple Regions.
	
	
Automated backups can be created across AWS Regions not same region.
Database cloning is only available for Aurora and not for RDS.






Use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio files to text and Amazon Athena to understand the underlying customer sentiments using SQL.

Amazon Quicksight is for the visual representation of data through Dashboards, graphs and various other modes. It has a rich feature set that helps analyze data and the complex relationships that exist between different data features. 
However, it is not an SQL query based analysis tool like Amazon Athena.




Performance lag for the data delivery speed between producers and consumers:
Use Enhanced Fanout feature of Kinesis Data Streams


As multiple applications are consuming the same stream concurrently, both SQS Standard and SQS FIFO are not the right fit for the given use-case.User Kisinsis Datat Stream.

Currently, the Standard SQS queue is only allowed as an Amazon S3 event notification destination, whereas the FIFO SQS queue is not allowed.




Company has its proprietary encryption algorithm, you have to leverage client-side encryption.	
	Use a customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
	Use a master key you store within your application.
Customer has the complate algorithm not only Key so It will be client side encription.

SSE-KMS: SSE-KMS provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom.	
SSE-C:  Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption.
SSE-S3: S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key.



RDS MySQ analytics reporting process slow:
	Create a read-replica with the same compute capacity and the same storage capacity as the primary. Point the reporting queries to run against the read replica.

You can create up to five RDS read replicas from one DB instance. 
For replication to operate effectively, each read replica should have the same amount of compute and storage resources as the source DB instance. If you scale the source DB instance, also scale the read replicas.

Multi-AZ deployments are not a read scaling solution, so you cannot use a standby to serve read traffic. The standby is there just for failover. 



Rebalancing:
	Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that rebalancing does not compromise the performance or availability of your application

Unhealthy instanc: 
	Auto Scaling creates a new scaling activity for terminating the unhealthy instance and then terminates it. 
	Later, another scaling activity launches a new instance to replace the terminated instance.




Big Data analysis job, read from  S3 and output to S3:

EMR is industry-leading cloud big data platform. Hadoop, an open-source framework/tools, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

Glue Big Data analysis jobs, extract data, transform it, and load the resulting data back to S3, data stores in a VPC, or on-premises JDBC data stores as a target.

Redshift - Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse
Redshift cluster consists of nodes. Not a Big data analysis tools.




Monolith application  automatically recover from the failure of an AZ:
	Assign an EC2 Instance Role to perform the necessary API calls
	Create an Elastic IP and use the EC2 user-data script to attach it
	Create an auto-scaling group that spans across 2 AZ, which min=1, max=1, desired=1

With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

Now, between the ALB and the Elastic IP. If we use an ALB, things will still work, but we will have to pay for the provisioned ALB which sends traffic to only one EC2 instance. Instead, to minimize costs, we must use an Elastic IP.



Private hosted zones feature of Route 53:
	enableDnsHostnames
	enableDnsSupport


RDS Multi AZ:
	RDS applies OS updates by performing maintenance on the standby, then promoting the standby to primary, and finally performing maintenance on the old primary, which becomes the new standby.
In this case, the database engine for the entire Multi-AZ deployment is shut down during the upgrade.




Characteristics of the Instance Store:
	You can't detach an instance store volume from one instance and attach it to a different instance .
	If you create an AMI from an instance, the data on its instance store volumes isn't preserved 
    and isn't present on the instance store volumes of the instances that you launch from the AMI.
	
When you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, every block of storage in the instance store is reset. 
Only Reboot can preserved data.
You can specify instance store volumes for an instance only when you launch it not on Restart.



Near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss:
	Capture data in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. Use Amazon Redshift to query the data.
It can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, generic HTTP endpoints, and service providers like Datadog, New Relic, MongoDB, and Splunk.
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to capture, transform, and load streaming data into Redshift for near real-time analytics.

Kinesis Data Streams, you have to manually allocate the shards for scaling the data ingestion process. Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) and Kinesis Data Analytics are for real-time processing of data and cannot provide long-term storage of data unlike a database or a data warehouse.




Highly available architecture for a bastion host solution:
	Create a public Network Load Balancer that links to EC2 instances that are bastion hosts managed by an ASG.
You need to remember that Bastion Hosts are using the SSH protocol, which is a TCP based protocol on port 22. They must be publicly accessible.	
	
Elastic IP can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time, so it won't provide you a highly available setup on its own. 
An ALB only supports HTTP traffic, which is layer 7, while the SSH protocol is based on TCP and is layer 4. So, the Application Load Balancer doesn't work.



AWS Firewall Manager not support this three reosurce:
	Amazon GuardDuty 
	Amazon Inspector for EC2.
	Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) = optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.

Amazon GuardDuty:
	Amazon GuardDuty offers threat detection that enables you to continuously monitor and protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. GuardDuty analyzes continuous streams of meta-data generated from your account and network activity found in AWS CloudTrail Events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs.


When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region.

Enabling Multi-AZ helps make our database highly-available, but the standby database is not accessible and cannot be used for reads or write.Until primary instance failed, Its for failover.



Cluster placement groups:
	 A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone.
	 A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region.
	 
Partition placement group:
	A partition placement group can multiple AZ in the same Region. 
	A partition placement group can have a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone. 
	The number of instances that can be launched into a partition placement group is limited only by the limits of your account.

Spread Placement Groups:
	Instances are located on different hardware racks in a single availability zone. Each rack is isolated from others.
	A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. 
	You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.




Permitted EC2 instances can read from the EFS:
	Use VPC security(Normal Security Group) groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system
	Use an IAM policy to control access for clients who can mount your file system with the required permissions


Amazon GuardDuty - Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect your AWS resources, including your AWS accounts and access keys. 
GuardDuty identifies any unusual or unauthorized activity, like cryptocurrency mining or infrastructure deployments in a region that has never been used. 
Powered by threat intelligence and machine learning, GuardDuty is continuously evolving to help you protect your AWS environment.






Relational Database use a caching service that supports multi-threading.:
	Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached 
You need to run large nodes with multiple cores or threads (support for multi-threading).
You need the ability to scale out and in, adding and removing nodes as demand on your system increases and decreases.

Redis does not support multi-threading, so this option is not the right fit for the given use case.



Spot blocks allow you to request Amazon EC2 Spot instances for 1 to 6 hours at a time to avoid being interrupted.
A Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances that are launched to meet your target capacity.



The NLB has to be accessible over the internet and hence has to be in a public subnet and will act as a single point-of-contact for all incoming traffic. 
NLB will forward the incoming traffic to the EC2 instances managed by the ASG in the private subnet.

ALB/NLB also supports TLS offloading.
Classic Load Balancer supports SSL offloading.


AWS Shield Advanced will give you DDoS protection overall, and you cannot set up rate-based rules in Shield, use WAF.





A) Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet
B) Define a custom route table with a route to the NAT gateway for internet traffic and associate it with the
   private subnets for the application tier.

C) Run the applications on EC2 instances enabled for hibernation. Hibernate the instances before the 2-week company shutdown.

C) Attach a secondary elastic network interface to the EC2 instance configured with the private IP address.
Move the network interface to the standby EC2 instance if the primary EC2 instance becomes
unreachable. 

A) Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on the S3 bucket.

C) Use server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).
D) Use client-side encryption to provide at-rest encryption.

A) Deploy On-Demand Instances during periods of high demand.

C) Configure the front-end application to send votes to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)queue. 
   Provision worker instances to read the SQS queue and write the vote information to the database.

B) Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer spanning multiple AZs for the
   web application instances.
E) Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Create an Amazon RDS
   Multi-AZ DB instance in the private subnets. Migrate the old database contents to the new DB instance.

C) Configure an Auto Scaling step scaling policy with an EC2 instance warmup condition.

C) Create an Aurora replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoints.




The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version.
	If your request to set an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and period, those settings override all bucket default settings for that object version.



VPC Peeringn vs VPN CloudHub:
	VPNCloudHub:
		Useful when you have multiple Brach Offices.
		Hub&Spoke topology
	VPCPeering:
		There is no single point of failure for communication or bandwidth bottleneck
		Use AWS backbone. Traffic is not encrypted.
		Cross Account
		Both VPC must be in the same Network
		Avoid VPC CIDR overlapping
		Transit VPC peering is not allowed.
		Inter-Region VPC Peering Availability
	TransitGateway:
		A transit gateway is a transit hub that can be used to interconnect VPCs and on-premises networks.



DataSync vs DMS vs StorageGateway:
	DataSync vs StorageGateway:
		DataSync connects to existing storage systems protocols (NFS, SMB), or using the Amazon S3 API. 
		Storage Gateway provides protocols such as iSCSI, SMB, and NFS.
	DMS:
		On-premises and EC2 databases to Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora.
		Homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle.
		Heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.


CloudFormation vs ElasticBeanstalk:
	Beanstalk: The starting point is the code. I have a NodeJs code I want to upload & run it; please provision Platform for me. (PaaS) Platform as a Service.
	Gives the developer the ability to manage only code and not systems.

	CloudFormation: The starting point is the infrastructure. Please create an EC2 instance, with one LoadBalancer, Security Group etc so that I can uploaded my NodeJs code to it. Infrastructure as Code (IaC).



"Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
	"StringEquals": {
	  "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
	}
So we can only launch EC2 instances in api call from eu-west-1.



On the function’s resource-based policy, add a permission that includes the lambda:InvokeFunction as action and arn:aws:iam::[DEV AWSAccount Number]:root as principal.
	AWS Lambda supports resource-based permissions policies for Lambda functions and layers. 
	You also use a resource-based policy to allow an AWS service to invoke your function on your behalf.



Run analysis on sales records stored in AmazonS3 and visualize the results of queries:
	Use AWS Glue crawler to build tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog. 
	Run queries using Amazon Athena. Use Amazon QuickSight for visualization.
	
You can use AWS Glue crawlers to automatically infer database and table schema from your data in Amazon S3 and store the associated metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
Athena uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog to store and retrieve table metadata for the Amazon S3 data in your AWS account. 
Finally, you can then visualize your Athena SQL queries in Amazon QuickSight.


S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes:
	-Governance mode
		In governance mode, users can’t overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions. but you can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the object if necessary. 
	-Compliance mode
		In compliance mode, a protected object version can’t be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. 

Legal Hold vs. Retention Period modes.
	With Object Lock, you can also place a legal hold on an object version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. 
	However, a legal hold doesn’t have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed. 
	Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission.
Legal holds are independent from retention periods.


Rehosting all on-premises applications, data, and operating systems to AWS:
	Create a replication task using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN).
	
	
	

EFS has a higher throughput than EBS.

AWS recommends that you should use AWS DataSync to migrate existing data to Amazon S3, and subsequently use the File Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway to retain access.


EFS uses the Network File System protocol NFS. EFS does not support SMB protocol.


Interconnect all VPCs together (AWS Transit Gateway):
AWS Transit Gateway that acts as a network transit hub, to interconnect your VPCs or connect your VPCs with on-premises networks.
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs .
Establishing VPC peering between all VPCs is an inelegant and clumsy way.	



Using Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve structured and semistructured data from files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables.
Loading S3 historical data into Redshift via COPY command or Glue ETL job would cost heavy for a one-time ad-hoc process. 
The same result can be achieved more cost-efficiently by using Redshift Spectrum.



AWS Lambda can be combined with DynamoDB to process and capture the key-value data from the IoT sources.
You cannot use Redshift to capture data in key-value pairs from the IoT.



Configure an AWS DataSync agent on the on-premises server that has access to the NFS file system. Transfer data over the Direct Connect connection to an AWS PrivateLink interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EFS by using a private VIF. 
Set up a DataSync scheduled task to send the video files to the EFS file system every 24 hours.
S3 access from VPC user GatewatyEndpoint/ not VPC EndPiint.



Create a VPC in an account and share one or more of its subnets with the other accounts using Resource Access Manager.
	VPC Peering in this case complax.
	Transit Gateway will be Expensive, as the solution need cost optimize.







Athena cannot be used to analyze data in real-time.
Kinesis Data Analytics is real-time analytic tools.

Both ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached are HIPAA Eligible.
DynamoDB is not an in-memory database, so this option is incorrect.

		"Resource":"*",
		"Condition":{
			"IpAddress":{
				"aws:SourceIp":"10.200.200.0/24"
			}
		}
	}
]
Users belonging to the IAM group can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-west-1 region when the user's source IP is 10.200.200.200


"Statement": [
{
  "Sid": "Mystery Policy",
  "Action": [

  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
	"StringEquals": {
	  "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
	}
  }
}
]	
It allows running EC2 instances only in the eu-west-1 region, and the API call can be made from anywhere in the world

##Cloud Computing    
-------------------------------------------------
Cloud computing is a computing service made available over the internet.
Cloud computing is a pay-as-you-go model for delivering IT resources.

Throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests an authorized program can submit to a given operation in a given amount 
of time.



2
##AWS BasicInfo
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon web service is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions.
AWS has Regions all around the world.

Every AWS service is publicly exposed (public URL)

AWS:
-Security: AWS provides a secure and durable platform that provides end-to-end security and storage.
-Flexibility: It allows users to select the operating systems, language, database, and other services as per their requirements.
-Easy to use: AWS lets you host your applications quickly and securely, regardless of whether 
 it’s an existing or new application.
-Scalable: The applications you use can be scaled up or down, depending on your requirements.
-Cost savings: You only pay for the compute power, storage, and other resources that you use, without any long-term commitments.
-Scheduling: This enables you to start and stop AWS services at predetermined times
-Reliability: AWS takes multiple backups at servers at multiple physical locations.


AWS Use cases:
• Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics
• Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps
• Gaming




3
##Region        
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Region is a separate geographic area.
A region is a cluster of data centers, Most AWS services are region-scoped.

How to choose  and AWS Region?
• Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
• Proximity to customers: reduced latency
• Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
• Pricing: pricing varies region to region.
 
 
 
 
 
4
##Availabiulity Zones |  AZ | az      
-------------------------------------------------
Availability zones (AZs) are isolated data centers located within specific regions.
AZ is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region.

Each region hase many availabuility zone.
Usually 3, Min 2 and Max 6;

They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters.
Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.





5
##Edge Locations
-------------------------------------------------
Edge locations are AWS data centers designed to deliver services with the lowest latency possible.
Edge location is a physical location where AWS has its servers that are used to stores cdn caching.

CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

An edge location is the nearest point to the consumer(user) who is consuming the AWS service. 
In these locations, the server is not present but a small setup is there. 
They are located in major cities around the world.


Uses:
	CloudFront: It makes use of edge locations to cache versions of the data it provides, 
	            allowing the content to be delivered to users more quickly.
	Route 53: It delivers DNS responses from edge locations, allowing DNS queries to be resolved more quickly.
	AWS Shield and Web Application Firewall: It screens traffic in edge locations to prevent undesired traffic.


AWS has Global Services:
• Identity and Access Management (IAM)
• Route 53 (DNS service)
• CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
• WAF (Web Application Firewall)


Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
• Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
• Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
• Lambda (Function as a Service)
• Rekognition (Software as a Service)
RegionalServices:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/





==| IAM Section
6
##IAM
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 

IAM enables organizations with many employees to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account.

Three types of Principals — Root Users, IAM Users and Instance Principals
IAM deals with four Principle Entities: Users, Groups, Roles and Policies.

A principal is a person or application that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource.

IAM roles and IAM users are separate IAM entities and should not be mixed. 
Only IAM roles can be used to access cross-account resources.
 
IAM Policies Structure:
• Version: policy language version, always include “2012-10-17”
• Id: an identifier for the policy (optional) 
• Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
• Statements consists of:
	• Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional) 
	• Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access(Allow, Deny)
	• Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to 
	• Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies 
	• Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to 
	• Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

Custom inline policy single uses for, only for one role. cant able to add multiple role.
When we create a custom policy:
	-Select a resource which for this policy 
	  like S3
	-We can create this policy for specific resource 
	  like we can set ARN of a spesific backet or all backer.

Multi Factor Authentication - MFA:
MFA = Password+Scurity device you own.
Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised.



How can access AWS, Three options:
	• AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
	• AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys
	• AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys
	
	
• Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don’t share them
	• Access Key ID ~= username
	• Secret Access Key ~= password


IAM Roles for Services: Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
Common roles: 
	• EC2 Instance Roles 
	• Lambda Function Roles 
	• Roles for CloudFormation 
	
	

IAM Security Tools:
	IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
		• a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

	IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
	IAM access advisor helps you audit service access, remove unnecessary permissions, and set 
		zappropriate permissions providing the last timestamp when an 
		IAM entity (e.g., user, role, or a group) accessed an AWS service.
	• Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
	• You can use this information to revise your policies.

When you use the AWS Management Console to create a user, you must choose to include at least a 
console password or access keys. 
By default, a brand new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no credentials of any kind. 
You must create the type of credentials for an IAM user based on the needs of your user.


IAM: Permissions:
• Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
• These policies define the permissions of the users.


You can assign an IAM Role to the users or groups from your Active Directory once it is integrated 
with your VPC via the AWS Directory Service AD Connector.


Area:
=====
IAM are a Global service.
Users, Groups, Roles, Accounts – Global
	Same AWS accounts, users, groups and roles can be used in all regions
Key Pairs – Global or Regional
	Amazon EC2 created key pairs are specific to the region
	RSA key pair can be created and uploaded that can be used in all regions



UseCase:
========
-Shared access to your AWS account
-Granular permissions
-Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2
-Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
-Identity federation
-Identity information for assurance
-PCI DSS Compliance
-Integrated with many AWS services


BillCost:
=========
No additional charge for IAM and STS. 


Security:
=========
MFA + Password Policy.




7
##User
-------------------------------------------------
An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS. 
An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.

A user in AWS consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, 
and up to two access keys that can be used with the API or CLI. 





8
##Group
-------------------------------------------------
An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. 
You can use user groups to specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make those permissions 
easier to manage for those users. 


UseCase:
========
A user group is a way to attach policies to multiple users at one time. 
When you attach an identity-based policy to a user group, all of the users in the user group receive the 
permissions from the user group.




9
##Policy
-------------------------------------------------
A policy is an JSON document or object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions.

For Centralized management of permissions Policies can be attached to users, groups, or Amazon S3 buckets.
 

AWS supports six types of policies: 
	Identity-based policies, 
	resource-based policies, 
	permissions boundaries, 
	Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and 
	Session policies.

Identity-based policies: are attached to an IAM user, group, or role to specify what that identity 
         can do (its permissions).
		 Identity-based policies grant permissions to an identity.
		 
Resource-based policies: Attach inline policies to resources, you can specify who has access to the resource 
         and what actions they can perform on it.  

Permissions boundaries: Use a managed policy as the permissions boundary for an IAM entity (user or role). 
						
						
Organizations SCPs: Organizations service control policy (SCP) to define the maximum permissions 
		for account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). 
	    SCPs limit permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies grant to entities 
	    (users or roles) within the account, but do not grant permissions.
The effective permissions are the logical intersection between what is allowed by the 
SCP and what is allowed by the IAM and resource-based policies.


S3-ACL:
Access control lists (ACLs) – Use ACLs to control which principals in other accounts can access the 
    resource to which the ACL is attached.
	ACLs are cross-account permissions policies that grant permissions to the specified principal. 
	ACLs cannot grant permissions to entities within the same account.
	
With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your 
Amazon S3 resources(buckets or objects).


VPC-ACL:
A network access control list (ACL) allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level. 
You can use the default network ACL for your VPC, or you can create a custom network ACL for your VPC with rules that are 
similar to the rules for your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.




Session policies: 
    Pass advanced session policies when you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to assume a role or a federated user. 
	Session policies limit the permissions that the role or user's identity-based policies grant to the session. 
	Session policies limit permissions for a created session, but do not grant permissions.



Area:
=====
Global Service.


UseCase:
========
You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to 
AWS (IAM) principals (roles, users, or groups) or AWS resources. 

AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal makes a request, such as uploading an object.




10
##IAM Role
-------------------------------------------------
Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf. 
To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.


Common roles: 
• EC2 Instance Roles 
• Lambda Function Roles 
• Roles for CloudFormation 


Area:
=====
Global Service.



UseCase:
========
1)Giving permissions to non-humans, such as services/applications.
Ex. EC2 of  needs access to S3.

2)Giving permissions to federated/outside users & groups.
An IAM user can assume a role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.




11
#IAM Section – Summary:
-------------------------------------------------
• Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
• Groups: contains users only
• Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
• Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
• Security: MFA + Password Policy
• Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
• Audit: IAM Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor





12
##AWS CLI | SDK | AccessKeys | CloudShell
-------------------------------------------------
CLI: A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell.
Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.

AWS SDK: Language-specific APIs (set of libraries), Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically.
Embedded within your application.


AWS CloudShell:
	AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that makes it easy to securely manage, explore, and interact with your AWS resources. 
	CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials.
	Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required.


AccessKey:
	Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic 
	requests that you make to AWS. 


Programmatic access:
	You must provide your AWS access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS or to use the 
	AWS Command Line Interface or AWS Tools for PowerShell.








==| EC2 Basics
13
##EC2
-------------------------------------------------
EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service.
Its provides scalable computing capacity in the  Cloud. 

When Launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool:
	Don’t specify a security group, the instance is automatically 
	assigned to the default security group for the VPC.

Using the Amazon EC2 console, you have an option to create a new security group.


EC2 sizing & configuration options: 
• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
• How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
• How much random-access memory (RAM) 
• How much storage space: 
	• Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
	• hardware (EC2 Instance Store) 
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
• Firewall rules: security group 
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

AWS has a limit of 20 instances per region. You can request a limit increase.


m5.2xlarge-
m: instance class
5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
2xlarge: size within the instance class


TypeOfEC2:
	-General purpose
	-Compute optimized
	-Memory-optimized
	-Storage optimized
	-Accelerated Computing

Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets 
on local storage.

Memory Optimized Instances is  are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory, 
which is quite different from handling high read and write capacity on local storage.
These instances are well suited for the following: High-performance, relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) databases.


Compute Optimized Instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors, 
such as batch processing workloads and media transcoding.

General Purpose Instances are the most basic type of instances. 
They provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of workloads.


You can put an instance that is in the InService state into the Standby state, update some software or 
troubleshoot the instance, and then return the instance to service.

Instances that are on standby are still part of the Auto Scaling group, 
but they do not actively handle application traffic.
 
Security Groups:
	• Can be attached to multiple instances
	• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
	• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
	• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
	• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
	• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
	  error or it’s not launched
	• All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
	• All outbound traffic is authorised by default.






On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your 
Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.
 
This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently 
from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.


There is a vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit per region which is why subsequent requests failed. 
Just submit the limit increase form to AWS and retry the failed requests once approved.


By default, the vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit is set per region and not per Availability Zone. 
This can be increased after submitting a request form to AWS.
 
By default, AWS allows you to provision a maximum of 20 instances per region. 
Select a different region and retry the failed request is incorrect. 
There is no need to select a different region since this limit can be increased after 
submitting a request form to AWS.



A company needs to deploy at least 2 EC2 instances to support the normal workloads of its application and 
automatically scale up to 6 EC2 instances to handle the peak load. 
The architecture must be highly available and fault-tolerant as it is processing mission-critical workloads.

ANS:
Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the 
minimum capacity to 4 and the maximum capacity to 6. 
Deploy 2 instances in Availability Zone A and another 2 instances in Availability Zone B.



Area:
=====
Resource Identifiers – Regional
	Each resource identifier, such as an AMI ID, instance ID, EBS volume ID, or EBS snapshot ID, 
	is tied to its region and can be used only in the region where you created the resource.
Instances – Availability Zone
	An instance is tied to the Availability Zones in which you launched it. 
	However, note that its instance ID is tied to the region.
EBS Volumes – Availability Zone
	Amazon EBS volume is tied to its Availability Zone and can be attached only to instances in the same Availability Zone.
EBS Snapshot – Regional
	An EBS snapshot is tied to its region and can only be used to create volumes in the same region and has to 
    be copied from One region to other if needed.





UseCase:
========
Renting virtual machines (EC2)
Auto-scaling, Pay-as-you-go, Increased Reliability, Elasticity.
Run cloud-native and enterprise applications.
Scale for HPC applications, Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications.
Develop for Apple platforms.
Train and deploy ML applications



BillCost:
=========
EC2 in FreeTier, 750 hours per month for 12 months with the AWS Free Tier.
Stopped EC2 instances do not incur any charges. 


EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
• On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
• Reserved (1 & 3 years)
	• Reserved Instances – long workloads
	• Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
• Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
• Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
• Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
	Instances run on hardware that’s to you
	May share hardware with otherinstances in same account
	No control over instance placement(can move hardware after Stop / Start)\
• Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
• Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
  No need for 1 or 3-year commitment, The Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity (only one).



Reserved Instances:
-------------------------------------------------
Reserved Instances do not renew automatically.
Keep in mind that you can always refer to On-Demand Instances to suffice any additional resource requirements.

Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the 
use of On-Demand Instances in your account.

You can also sell your unused instance for Standard RIs but 
not Convertible RIs on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

You can reserve capacity to a specific AWS Region (regional Reserved Instance) or specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instance) 
only. You cannot reserve capacity to multiple AWS Regions in a single RI purchase.


Capacity Reservations:
On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your 
Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. 
This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently 
from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.

When you create a Capacity Reservation, you specify:
– The Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity
– The number of instances for which to reserve capacity
– The instance attributes, including the instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS

In addition, you can use Savings Plans and Regional Reserved Instances with your Capacity Reservations to benefit from billing discounts.




Security:
=========
Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you.
Managing the guest operating system and software deployed to the guest operating system, 
including updates and security patches.





##Amazon EC2 Instance Purchasing Options
-------------------------------------------------
https://enlear.academy/aws-ec2-purchasing-options-and-spot-instances-overview-44dd5fb0d8f7

1) On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing.
2) Reserved Instances: long workloads (≥ 1 year).
	Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances.
	Scheduled Reserved Instances: launch within time window you reserve.
3) Spot Instances: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances.
4) Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware.
5) Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement.




Spot Instances:
===============
Spot blocks can only be used for a span of up to 6 hours.
ASpot Price is the hourly rate for a Spot instance. 

 You can use Spot Instances for various stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications.
 Spot instances can be taken back by AWS with two minutes of notice, so spot instances cannot be 
 reliably used for running the dev application (which can be up and running for up to 8 hours).
 
 
Spot instances can be used for applications flexible in the timing when they can run and also able to 
handle interruption by storing the state externally for e.g. they are 
well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks

Spot instances differ from the On-Demand instances:
	they are not launched immediately
	they can be terminated anytime
	price varies as per the demand and supply of spot instances
	
Spot instances can also be launched with a required duration (max 6 hour) (also known as Spot blocks), 
which are not interrupted due to changes in the Spot price.

A Spot Instance request is either one-time or persistent.


There are two types of spot requests:
-A one-time spot request stays active until  EC2 runs the spot instance, you cancel the request, or it expires. 
	If the spot price goes above your bid or capacity is unavailable, 
	Amazon terminates the spot instance and closes the spot request.

-A persistent spot instance request stays active until you cancel it or until it expires—even if, 
	Amazon carried out the request. 
	If the spot price goes above your bid or capacity becomes unavailable, the spot instance is interrupted. 
	Amazon keeps the request open, and if conditions change and a spot instance does become available, it starts or 
	resumes the spot instance


What are Spot Instance Interruptions?	
	EC2 can interrupt the Spot instance when the Spot price rises above the bid price, 
	when the demand for Spot instances rises, or when the supply of Spot instances decreases.
	not available on the Zone.

EC2 Instance Rebalance Recommendation: is a signal that notifies when a Spot Instance is at elevated risk 
of interruption. The signal provides an opportunity to proactively manage the Spot Instance
in advance of the two-minute Spot Instance interruption notice.

		
When an instance is interrupted, you can select one of 
	Three possible actions:
		Terminating the spot instance (default), 
		Stopping the spot instance (making it possible to restart it with the same launch specifications), or 
		Hibernating the instance.


EC2 tries to maintain the target capacity, adding spot instances if available, 
based on the request details. 
When spot instances are terminated, 
Spot Fleet attempts to replace them using the lowest price option available.

Spot blocks:
Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are designed not to be interrupted and will run continuously 
for the duration you select. This makes them ideal for jobs that take a finite time to complete, 
such as batch processing, encoding and rendering, modeling and analysis, and continuous integration.


What is AWS Spot Fleet?
Spot Fleet is a collection of spot instances.


Spot Fleet requests type:
Request
	Spot Fleet places an asynchronous one-time request for the desired capacity.
	If capacity is diminished because of Spot interruptions, the fleet does not attempt
	to replenish Spot Instances, nor does it submit requests in alternative Spot capacity pools if 
	capacity is unavailable.
Maintain
	Spot Fleet places an asynchronous request for the desired capacity and maintains capacity 
	by automatically replenishing any interrupted Spot Instances.





 
13
##Security Group
-------------------------------------------------
Security groups are stateful,You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
An AWS security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
You can specify one or more security groups for each EC2 instance, with a maximum of five per network interface. 

All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
All outbound traffic is authorised by default.

Can be attached to multiple instances.




14
##EC2 Instance Role
-------------------------------------------------
When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance 
to securely access aws Resources.

Use an instance profile to pass an IAM role to EC2 instance.
An instance profile can contain only one IAM role, although a role can be included in multiple instance profiles. 
This limit of one role per instance profile cannot be increased.




15
##Elastic IP | PublicVsPrivate
-------------------------------------------------
PublicVsPrivate:
A private IPv4 address is an IP address that's not reachable over the Internet. 
You can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between instances in the same VPC.

A public IP address is an IPv4 address that's reachable from the Internet. 
You can use public addresses for communication between your instances and the Internet.

An Elastic IP address is a static (doesn't change) public IPv4 address associated with your AWS account. 
AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region.



Area:
=====
Elastic IP Address – Regional



UseCase:
========
You can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another 
instance in your account.
 
Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, 
so that your domain points to your instance.
 
 
 
BillCost:
=========
To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, aws impose a small hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is 
not associated with a running instance, or if it is associated with a stopped instance or 
an unattached network interface. 

While your instance is running, you are not charged for one Elastic IP address associated with the instance, 
but you are charged for any additional Elastic IP addresses associated with the instance.




16
##Placement Group
-------------------------------------------------
Placement Groups are logical groupings or clusters of instances in the selected AWS region. 
Specifically used for launching cluster compute instance types.

Placement type:
Cluster(Same Rack Same AZ ) – clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone.
	This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance.
	:If the rack fails, all instances fails at the same time.

Use case:
• Big Data job that needs to complete fast
• Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput.



Partition(Not Same Rack but Same AZ ) — spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on
	different sets of racks) within a single AZ.
	Do not share the same rack.  
	Can span across multiple AZs in the same region.
	
A partition placement group can have a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone. 
Since a partition placement group can have partitions in multiple Availability Zones in the same region, 
therefore instances will not have low-latency network performance. 

Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions.
:A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won’t affect other partitions.




Spread(Not Same Rack Not Same AZ ) – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct 
underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.
    For Each instance each different Rack or Hardware.
	It spread the instances across multiple AZ.
	It reduces the risk of failure of the network since other instances are active in other zones.
	:Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group

Use case:
• Application that needs to maximize high availability.
• Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other.







17
##ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Network Interface or Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) are virtual network cards attached to EC2 
instances that help facilitate network connectivity for instances. 
Having two or more of them connected to an instance permits it to communicate on two separate subnets.

Attaching a secondary network interface allows you to connect your EC2 instance to two networks at once.

Has the following attributes:
Description
Private IP Address
Elastic IP Address
MAC Address
Security Group(s)
Source/Destination Check Flag
Delete on Termination Flag



Area:
=====
Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)
Each ENI lives within a particular subnet of the VPC.



UseCase:
========
A common use case for ENIs is the creation of management networks. 
This allows you to have public-facing applications like web servers in a public subnet but lock down 
SSH access down to a private subnet on a secondary network interface.



BillCost:
=========
ENIs are entirely free to use, it has standard AWS data charges.



Security:
=========
ENIs have security groups, just like EC2 instances, which act as a built in firewall.







18
##EC2 Hibernate
-------------------------------------------------
Hibernation gives you the ability to launch EC2 instances, set them up as desired, hibernate them, 
and then quickly  bring them back to life when you need them. 

Hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon EBS root volume.
Root Volume – must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
An instance can NOT be hibernated more than 60 day


UseCase:
========
Long-running processing
Saving the RAM state
Services that take time to initialize



BillCost:
=========
While the instance is in hibernation, you pay only for the EBS storage and any 
Elastic IP addresses attached to the instance.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.






19
##EC2 Instance Storage Section
-------------------------------------------------
You can only use block-level storage with an EC2 instance where the OS runs.
There are two block-level storage options for EC2 instances.

Instance store:
An instance store volume is a disk that is physically attached to the host computer that runs the 
EC2 virtual machine (VM).

EBS volume:
EBS volume, which provides off-instance storage that will persist independently from the life of the instance. 


Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, 
	caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a 
	fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.

If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), data in the instance store persists.
When you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, every block of storage in the instance store is reset, data loss.




21
##EBS
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is Amazon’s block-level storage solution used with the 
EC2 cloud service to store persistent data. 
This means that the data is kept on the AWS EBS servers even when the EC2 instances are shutdown. 

EBS volume is a storage area network (SAN) storage and not a POSIX-compliant shared file system. 
You have to use EFS instead.

• An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
• It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
• They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
• They are bound to a specific availability zone


Amazon EBS volume types:
	Solid state drives (SSD)
	General Purpose SSD volumes
	Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes

Hard disk drives (HDD) 
Previous generation 




Area:
=====
EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone



UseCase:
========
Preserve root volume when instance is terminated
Run relational or NoSQL databases
Migrate mid-range, on-premises storage area network (SAN) workloads to the cloud.



BillCost:
=========
30 GB of storage for 12 months with the AWS Free Tier 
Volume storage for all EBS volume types is charged by the amount of GB you provision per month 
until you release the storage. 
Costs increase for EBS volumes that support additional input/output 
operations per second (IOPS) and throughput beyond baseline performance.



Security:
=========
Ensure EBS volumes are encrypted with KMS CMKs in order to have full control over data encryption and decryption.
Encrypted Volumes and snapshots  with CMK




22
++EBS Shapshort
-------------------------------------------------
• Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
• Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
• Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region


EBS Snapshots Features:
• EBS Snapshot Archive
	• Move a Snapshot to an ”archive tier” that is 75% cheaper
	• Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
• Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
	• Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
	• Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
• Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
	• Force full initialization of snapshots.





23
##AMI
-------------------------------------------------
• AMI = Amazon Machine Image
• AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
	• You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
	• Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
• AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
• You can launch EC2 instances from:
	• A Public AMI: AWS provided
	• Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
	• An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)


An AMI includes the following:
	One or more Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, 
	a template for the root volume of the instance 
		(for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
    Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
	A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.



AMI to EC2 Instance:
	• Start an EC2 instance and customize it
	• Stop the instance (for data integrity)
	• Build an AMI – this will also create EBS snapshots
	• Launch instances from other AMIs


During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other 
EBS volumes attached to your instance. 

You're charged for the snapshots until you deregister the AMI and delete the snapshots. 
If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on 
instances that support Amazon EBS encryption.


 
AMIs – Regional
AMI provides templates to launch EC2 instances

When the new AMI is copied from region A into region B, it also creates a snapshot in region 
B because AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots. 




 
24
##EC2 Instance Store
-------------------------------------------------
• EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
• If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
• Better I/O performance
• EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)
• Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
• Risk of data loss if hardware fails
• Backups and Replication are your responsibility





25
##EBS Volume Types | Use cases
-------------------------------------------------
Volume Types:
	General Purpose SSD volumes
	Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes
	Throughput Optimized HDD and Cold HDD volumes
	Previous generation Magnetic volumes

• Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes

General Purpose SSD: Maximum 10,000 IOPS/Volume
Provisioned IOPS SSD: Maximum 20,000 IOPS/Volume
Throughput Optimized HDD: Maximum throughput 500 MiB/s (Optimized for throughput rather than IOPS, good for large, contiguous reads)


EBS Volumes come in 6 types:
• gp2 / gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance 
  for a wide variety of workloads.
• io1 / io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or 
  high-throughput workloads
• st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput- intensive workloads
• sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)

General Purpose SSD:
• Cost effective storage, low-latency
• System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments


Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD:
• Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
• Or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
• Great for databases workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
  Supports EBS Multi-attach 

Hard Disk Drives (HDD):
• Cannot be a boot volume 
• 125 GiB to 16 TiB



EBS Multi-Attach – io1/io2 family:
• Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
• Each instance has full read & write permissions to the volume

• Use case:
	• Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (ex: Teradata)
	• Applications must manage concurrent write operations
	• Up to 16 EC2 Instances at a time (ExamTips)
	• Must use a file system that’s cluster-aware (not XFS, EX4, etc…) 


You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance. The volume and instance must be in the same Availability Zone. 
Depending on the volume and instance types, you can use Multi-Attach to mount a volume to multiple instances at the same time.

Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD ( io1 or io2 ) volume to multiple instances that 
are in the same Availability Zone.



EBS Encryption:When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
• Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
• All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
• All snapshots are encrypted
• All volumes created from the snapshot
• Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
• Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
• EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
• Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
• Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted


Encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume:
• Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
• Encrypt the EBS snapshot ( using copy )
• Create new ebs volume from the snapshot ( the volume will also be encrypted )
• Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance




Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM):
Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) is an automated procedure to back up the data stored on 
your Amazon EBS volumes. Use Amazon DLM to create lifecycle policies to automate snapshot management.

You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken 
to back up your Amazon EBS volumes. Automating snapshot management helps you to:

– Protect valuable data by enforcing a regular backup schedule.
– Retain backups as required by auditors or internal compliance.
– Reduce storage costs by deleting outdated backups.


Combined with the monitoring features of Amazon CloudWatch Events and AWS CloudTrail,
Amazon DLM provides a complete backup solution for EBS volumes at no additional cost.


There is no such thing as EBS-cycle policy in Amazon S3.


EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you 
can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.


EBS Volumes:
– When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated 
  within that zone to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.
– After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone
– Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volume to 
	multiple Nitro-based instances that are in the same Availability Zone. However, other 
	EBS types are not supported.
– An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance. 
  You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance creation.
– EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you 
  can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
– Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)
– EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.

##EFS
-------------------------------------------------
Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)
Amazon EFS only supports file locking. Object lock is a feature of Amazon S3 and not Amazon EFS.


Amazon EFS provides a simple, serverless, set-and-forget elastic file system. 
With Amazon EFS, you can create a file system, 
mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and from your file system.

• Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
• EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
• Highly available, automatically scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use 


Amazon EFS offers four storage classes: 
	Two standard storage classes(Multi-AZ):
		Amazon EFS Standard 
		Amazon EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA). 

	Two One Zone storage classes:
		Amazon EFS One Zone
		Amazon EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA).



Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region.



Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) 
for high availability and durability. 
Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, 
regions, and VPCs, while on-premises servers can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.


Use Amazon EFS and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to 
Amazon EFS-IA after 2 years is incorrect because the maximum days for the 
EFS lifecycle policy is only 90 days. The requirement is to move the files that are 
older than 2 years or 730 days.


Create an Amazon Elastic Filesystem (EFS) file system and enable encryption. 
Configure AWS Transfer for SFTP to securely upload files to the EFS file system. 

Apply an EFS lifecycle policy to delete files after 30 days is incorrect. 
This may be possible, however, the EFS lifecycle management doesn’t delete objects. 
It can only transition files in and out of the “Infrequent Access” tier.


Area:
=====
Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)

UseCase:
========
Content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress.

Share code and other files in a secure, organized way to increase DevOps agility and 
respond faster to customer feedback.
Persist and share data from your AWS containers and serverless applications with zero management required.


BillCost:
=========
AWS Free Tier
You pay only for the storage you use, for read and write access to data stored in 
Infrequent Access storage classes, and for any provisioned throughput.



Security:
=========
Uses security group to control access to EFS
Encryption at rest using KMS

When using Amazon EFS, you specify Amazon EC2 security groups for your EC2 instances and 
security groups for the EFS mount targets associated with the file system.

##Scalability & High Availability
-------------------------------------------------
• Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
• There are two kinds of scalability:
• Vertical Scalability
• Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
• Scalability is linked but different to High Availability


Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
• From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU
• To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs

Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
• Auto Scaling Group
• Load Balancer

High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
• Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
• Load Balancer multi AZ



Load Balancing:
Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream.


Why use a load balancer? 
• Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
• Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application 
• Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances 
• Do regular health checks to your instances 
• Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites 
• Enforce stickiness with cookies 
• High availability across zones 
• Separate public traffic from private traffic





28
##ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) 
-------------------------------------------------
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as 
EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.
 
It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. 

Elastic Load Balancing supports the following load balancers: 
	Application Load Balancers, 
	Network Load Balancers, 
	Gateway Load Balancers,
	Classic Load Balancers.



It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services:
• EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
• ACM, CloudWatch
• Route53, AWS WAF, GlobaAccelerator

Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs



Health Checks:
• They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
• The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
• If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy


Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests 
sent to your load balancer. Each log contains information such as the time the request was 
received, the client’s IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses. 
You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues.



Area:
=====
Elastic Load Balancer – Regional
Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across instances in multiple Availability Zones in the same region


UseCase:
========
Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.



BillCost:
=========
AWS Free Tier.

ELB pricing also follows an AWS rule: “You only pay for what you use with your setup.” 
To properly bill you for your ELB usage, AWS has introduced a component called the Load Balancer Capacity Unit (LCU), 
which is an integral part of your billing calculation, along with the region you host your infrastructure.



Security:
=========
Security Group of Load Balancer => Application Security Group, Allow traffic only from Load Balancer.

Ensure your ELBs do not use insecure or deprecated SSL ciphers.
Ensure that your AWS ELBs listeners are using a secure protocol (HTTPS or SSL).
Ensure there are valid security groups associated with your Elastic Load Balancer.
Ensure that your AWS Elastic Load Balancers use access logging to analyze traffic patterns and 
identify and troubleshoot security issues.






29
##CLB (Classic Load Balancer)
-------------------------------------------------
Load balancer routes traffic between clients and backend servers based on IP address and TCP port. 
For example, an ELB at a given IP address receives a request from a client on TCP port 80 (HTTP).

• Supports TCP (Layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS (Layer 7)
• Health checks are TCP or HTTP based
• Fixed hostname XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com


Area:
=====
Regional scope.



UseCase:
========
Support for EC2-Classic
Support for TCP and SSL listeners
Support for sticky sessions using application-generated cookies



BillCost:
=========
You are charged for each hour or partial hour that a 
Classic Load Balancer is running and for each GB of data transferred through your load balancer.



Security:
=========
Security is a shared responsibility.
Elastic Load Balancing provides a security group.






29
##ALB (Application Load Balancer)
-------------------------------------------------
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) only works at layer 7 (HTTP).
A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. 

ALBs can also route and load balance gRPC traffic between microservices or between 
gRPC-enabled clients and services, gRPC protocol is at Layer 7.
Network Load Balancers do not support gRPC.


Gateway Load Balancer operates as a Layer 3 Gateway and a Layer 4 Load Balancing service.

To connect to an ALB, a client needs to resolve its DNS name, No IP address.

So when you need static IP addresses for inbound traffic, the ALB is not an option. 
Luckily, that’s something the NLB comes with out-of-the-box.

• Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines(target groups)
• Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine(ex: containers)
• Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
• Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)

Routing tables to different target groups:
• Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
• Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
• Routing based on Query String, Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)



Target Groups:
• EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) – HTTP
• ECS tasks (managed by ECS itself) – HTTP
• Lambda functions – HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
• IP Addresses – must be private IPs
• ALB can route to multiple target groups.
• Health checks are at the target group leve.


• Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
• The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
	• The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
	• We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)



Routing different types:
	Host-based Routing:
	You can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing you to 
	route to multiple domains from the same load balancer.

	Path-based Routing:
	You can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header.

	HTTP header-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header.

	HTTP method-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on any standard or custom HTTP method.

	Query string parameter-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on the query string or query parameters.

	Source IP address CIDR-based routing:
	You can route a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates.


Host-based routing defines rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the 
hostname in the host header instead of the URL.

ALB only HTTP or HTTPS health check.
ICMP health check and FTP health check are incorrect as these are not supported.
A TCP health check is only offered in Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers.
 
 
Area:
=====
Regional scope.


UseCase:
========
IP address registration as targets
Path-based/host-based routing
Calling Lambda functions to serve HTTP(S) requests
AWS WAF load balancer
SNI
Enhanced containers via load balancing between multiple ports of a single instance


BillCost:
=========
You are charged for each hour or partial hour that an Application Load Balancer is running, 
and the number of Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCU) used per hour.


Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.
Elastic Load Balancing provides a security group.





30
##NLB (Network Load Balancer)
-------------------------------------------------
Network Load Balancer cannot facilitate content-based routing, ALB does it.

Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
	• Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
	• Handle millions of request per seconds
	• Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
	
• NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP(helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
• NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic

Provide IP address - Static, Elastic, not DNS name.
The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address before forwarding it to the target.

Network Load Balancer –Target Groups:
• EC2 instances
• IP Addresses – must be private IPs
• Application Load Balancer
• Health Checks support the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols


ExamTips: If you see UDP or TCP, its NLB;
          If your application(nlb) access with one,two or three ips then its NLB as option.
		  If see Extreme performance, UPD,TCP or static IP its NLB;
		  Back end application Health Checks support the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols only.
		  


The NLB uses HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP as possible protocols when performing health checks on targets. 
The default is the TCP protocol. If the target type is ALB, the supported health check protocols are 
HTTP and HTTPS. 


Area:
=====
Regional scope.



UseCase:
========
NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
This type of load balancer works at the transport layer(TCP/SSL) of the OSI model. 
It’s capable of handling millions of requests per second.  
It is mainly used for load balancing TCP traffic.



BillCost:
=========
No AWS free tier
You are charged for each hour or partial hour that a Network Load Balancer is running, and the number of 
Network Load Balancer Capacity Units (NLCU) used by Network Load Balancer per hour.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.
Network Load Balancers do not have security groups.





31
##GWLB (Gateway Load Balaner)
-------------------------------------------------
A Gateway Load Balancer operates at the 3 layer. 
It listens for all IP packets across all ports and forwards traffic to the target group that's 
specified in the listener rule, using the GENEVE protocol on port 6081.


Source and destination  are unaware the traffic is inspected and do somthing. 
(Vertual application like Friewall, IDP)
Operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model, the network layer.
Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081


Gateway Load Balancer –Target Groups:
• EC2 instances
• IP Addresses – must be private IPs

Gateway Load Balancer endpoint:
A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity between 
virtual appliances in the service provider VPC and application servers in the service consumer VPC. 

You deploy the Gateway Load Balancer in the same VPC as the virtual appliances.


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-gateway-load-balancer-easy-deployment-scalability-and-high-availability-for-partner-appliances/

Area:
=====
Runs within one AZ and is recommended to be deployed in multiple AZs for greater availability.



UseCase:
========
Deploy third-party virtual appliances faster.
Improve virtual appliance availability.
Centralize your third-party virtual appliances
Add third-party security appliances to your network
Integration with orchestration and deployment tools.
Gateway Load Balancers provides you the facility to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances like firewall. 
Gateway Load Balancers combines a transparent network gateway and then distributes the traffic.



BillCost:
=========
You are charged for each hour or partial hour that a Gateway Load Balancer is running, and the number of 
Gateway Load Balancer Capacity Units (GLCU) used by Gateway Load Balancer per hour. 
Gateway Load Balancer uses Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint (GWLBE),GWLBE is priced and billed separately.
You pay charges for inter-AZ data transfer if enabled.

Gateway Load Balancer + Gateway Load Balancer endpoints + virtual appliances + data processing charges.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.
Gateway Load Balancers do not have associated security groups. Therefore, the security groups for your
targets must use IP addresses to allow traffic from the load balancer






32
##Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
-------------------------------------------------
It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the 
  same instance behind a load balancer.
• This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers
• The “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
• Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances 

Use case: 
Make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data.


Sticky Sessions – Cookie:

• Application-based Cookies
	Custom cookie
		• Generated by the target
		• Can include any custom attributes required by the application
		• Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
		• Don’t use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
	Application cookie
		• Generated by the load balancer
		• Cookie name is AWSALBAPP

• Duration-based Cookies
	• Cookie generated by the load balancer
	• Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB



Cross-Zone Load Balancing:
	With Cross Zone Load Balancing  each load balancer instance distributes evenly
	across all registered instances in all AZ.(All Host==Host)

	Without Cross Zone Load Balancing: Requests are distributed in the instances of the
	node of the Elastic Load Balancer (All AZ == AZ)


Cross-Zone Load Balancing:
• Application Load Balancer 
	• Always on (can’t be disabled) 
	• No charges for inter AZ data 
• Network Load Balancer 
	• Disabled by default 
	• You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled 
• Classic Load Balancer 
	• Disabled by default 
	• No charges for inter AZ data if enabled



SSL/TLS - Basics:
• An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer
  to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
• SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections
• TLS refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version
• Nowadays, TLS certificates are mainly used, but people still refer as SSL
• Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
• Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc…
• SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed

You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
You can create upload your own certificates alternatively



Load Balancer - SSL Certificates:

Classic Load Balancer (v1)
• Support only one SSL certificate
• Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates

Application Load Balancer (v2)
• Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
• Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work

Network Load Balancer (v2)
• Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
• Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work


HTTPS listener-multiple SSL certificates:
• You must specify a default certificate
• You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
• Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
• Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL / TLS (legacy clients)


SSL-Server Name Indication (SNI):
• SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
• The server will then find the correct certificate, or return the default one
Note:
• Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generation), CloudFront
• Does not work for CLB (older gen)







Connection Draining:
Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is willing to de-registering.
Between 1 to 3600 seconds (1hr) (default: 300 seconds 5mm)


When Connection Draining is enabled and configured, the process of deregistering an instance from an 
Elastic Load Balancer gains an additional step. 

For the duration of the configured timeout, the load balancer will allow existing, in-flight requests 
made to an instance to complete, but it will not send any new requests to the instance.

AWS ELB connection draining prevents breaking open network connections while taking an instance out of service.



Feature naming (Call same feature different way ! ):
• Connection Draining – for CLB
• Deregistration Delay – for ALB & NLB





33
##ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity.

If exactly 10, then desired capacity to 10.
If Range of Instance then minMix.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to provision new resources takes minutes. Lambda within seconds.


The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
• Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
• Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
• Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of EC2 instances running
• Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
• Re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealthy)

Use predictive scaling:
You can also combine predictive scaling and dynamic scaling (proactive and reactive approaches, respectively) 
to scale your EC2 capacity faster.


Auto Scaling Group Attributes:
	• A Launch Template (older “Launch Configurations” are deprecated)
	• AMI + Instance Type
	• EC2 User Data
	• EBS Volumes
	• Security Groups
	• SSH Key Pair
	• IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances
	• Network + Subnets Information
	• Load Balancer Information
	• Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
	• Scaling Policies


It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric)


Dynamic Scaling Policies:
	Target Tracking Scaling:
	• Most simple and easy to set-up
	• Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%

	Simple / Step Scaling:
	• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
	• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1

	Scheduled Actions:
	• Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
	• Example: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays


Manual scaling:
	At any time, you can change the size of an existing Auto Scaling group manually.

Predictive scaling: 
	Continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead.


Cooldown period:
After a scaling activity happens, you are in the cooldown period (default 300 seconds = 5M).
During the cooldown period, the ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances 
(to allow for metrics to stabilize)
Advice: Use a ready-to-use AMI to reduce configuration time in order to be serving 
request fasters and reduce the cooldown period.

ASG tries the balance the number of instances across AZ by default.


ASG Lifecycle Hooks:
• You have the ability to perform extra steps before the instance goes in service (Pending state)
• You have the ability to perform some actions before the instance is terminated (Terminating state)


Launch Configuration (legacy,deprecated):
	• Must be re-created every time
Launch Template (newer):
	• Can have multiple versions
	• Create parameters subsets (partial configuration for re-use and inheritance)


Suspend the ReplaceUnhealthy process type for the Auto Scaling group and apply the maintenance 
patch to the instance. 

Once the instance is ready, you can manually set the instance's health status 
back to healthy and activate the ReplaceUnhealthy process type again.

Taking the snapshot of the existing instance to create a new AMI and then creating a new instance 
in order to apply the maintenance patch, is not time/resource optimal.


ASG cannot directly use a Cloudwatch alarm as the source for a scale-in or scale-out event. Based on the alarm:
	• We can create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances)
	• We can create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)

You can put an instance that is in the InService state into the Standby state, 
update some software or troubleshoot the instance, and then return the instance to service.

Instances that are on standby are still part of the Auto Scaling group, but they do not actively 
handle application traffic.



Step scaling policies increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target 
based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments.

The option that says: create a new target group and create a new target group and 
launch configuration are both incorrect because you only want to change the 
AMI being used by your instances, and not the instances themselves. 
Target groups are primarily used in ELBs and not in Auto Scaling. 
The scenario didn’t mention that the architecture has a load balancer. 
Therefore, you should be updating your launch configuration, not the target group.


Deploy eight EC2 instances with Auto Scaling in one Availability Zone behind an 
Amazon Elastic Load Balancer is incorrect because this architecture is not highly available. 
If that Availability Zone goes down then your web application will be unreachable.

T3 instances also have a Burstable Performance capability to burst or go beyond the 
current compute capacity of the instance to higher performance as required by your workload. 
So your 4 servers will be able to manage 110% compute capacity for a short period of time. 
This is the power of cloud computing versus our on-premises network architecture. 
It provides elasticity and unparalleled scalability.


Default termination policy:

1. If there are instances in multiple Availability Zones, choose the Availability Zone with the most instances and at least 
one instance that is not protected from scale in. If there is more than one Availability Zone with this number of instances, 
choose the Availability Zone with the instances that use the oldest launch configuration.

2. Determine which unprotected instances in the selected Availability Zone use the oldest launch configuration. 
If there is one such instance, terminate it.

3. If there are multiple instances to terminate based on the above criteria, determine which unprotected instances are 
closest to the next billing hour. (This helps you maximize the use of your EC2 instances and manage your Amazon EC2 usage costs.) 
If there is one such instance, terminate it.

4. If there is more than one unprotected instance closest to the next billing hour, choose one of these instances at random.


There are three main parts in a distributed messaging system: the components of your distributed 
system which can be hosted on EC2 instance; your queue (distributed on Amazon SQS servers); 
and the messages in the queue.
To improve the scalability of your distributed system, you can add Auto Scaling group to your EC2 instances.

==| RDS, Aurora & ElastiCache
34
##RDS 
-------------------------------------------------

RDS stands for Relational Database Service
• It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
• It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
• Postgres
• MySQL
• MariaDB
• Oracle
• Microsoft SQL Server
• Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Oracle RMAN and RAC are not supported in RDS.
 
 
RDS is a managed service:
• Automated provisioning, OS patching
• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
• Monitoring dashboards
• Read replicas for improved read performance
• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
• Maintenance windows for upgrades
• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
• BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)

Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. 
Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary 
DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different 
Availability Zone (AZ). Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region.


RDS – From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ, Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)


RDS Backups:
• Automated backups:
	• Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
	• Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
	• => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
	• 1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
• Manual DB Snapshots:
	• Manually triggered by the user
	• Retention of backup for as long as you want


ExamTrick: in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for storage. If you plan on
stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot & restore instead.



IAM database authentication provides the following benefits:
	Network traffic to and from the database is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
	You can use IAM to centrally manage access to your database resources, instead of managing access individually on each DB instance.
	For applications running on Amazon EC2, you can use profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database 
	instead of a password, for greater security.

Although STS is used to send temporary tokens for authentication, this is not a compatible use case for RDS.

RDS– Storage Auto Scaling:
• Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
• When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically


RDS Read Replicas for read scalability:
• Up to 5 Read Replicas
• Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
• Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
• Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
• Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
• Read replicas are used for SELECT =read only kind of statements(not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)


RDS Read Replicas – Network Cost:
• In AWS there’s a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
• For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don’t pay that fee.


RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery):
• SYNC replication
• One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
• Increase availability
• Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
• No manual intervention in apps
• Not used for scaling
• Multi-AZ replication is free
• Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)


++RDS Custom for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
-------------------------------------------------
• Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Database with OS and database customization
• RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of database in AWS
• Custom: access to the underlying database and OS so you can
	• Configure settings
	• Install patches
	• Enable native features
	• Access the underlying EC2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
• De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before

• RDS vs. RDS Custom
	• RDS: entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
	• RDS Custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the database


Failover support:
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. 
Amazon RDS uses several different technologies to provide failover support. 

Multi-AZ deployments for Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB DB instances use Amazon’s failover technology. 
SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM).
Multi-AZ deployments for Microsoft SQL Server by using either Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs). 


Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any of the following:
	Loss of availability in primary Availability Zone.
	Loss of network connectivity to primary.
	Compute unit failure on primary.
	Storage failure on primary.





RDS Security – Summary:
• Encryption at rest:
	• Is done only when you first create the DB instance
	• or: unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted => create DB from snapshot
• Your responsibility:
	• Check the ports /IP/ security group inbound rules in DB’s SG
	• In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM
	• Creating a database with or without public access
	• Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
• AWS responsibility:
	• No SSH access
	• No manual DB patching
	• No manual OS patching
	• No way to audit the underlying instance


Basic Schema Copy will not migrate secondary indexes, foreign keys or stored procedures. 

When you need to use a more customizable schema migration process (e.g. when you are migrating your 
production database and need to move your stored procedures and secondary database objects), 
you must use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool.


When you create or modify your DB instance to run as a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains 
a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. 
Updates to your DB Instance are synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to the standby in order to keep both in sync 
and protect your latest database updates against DB instance failure.



Encryption of Data in Transit:
-------------------------------------------------
Encrypt communications between your application and your DB Instance using SSL/TLS.

Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance 
when the instance is provisioned. 


For MySQL, you launch the mysql client using the --ssl_ca parameter 
to reference the public key in order to encrypt connections. 

For SQL Server, download the public key 
and import the certificate into your Windows operating system. 

RDS for Oracle uses Oracle native network encryption with a DB instance. 



IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
IAM authentication is just another way to authenticate the user's credentials while accessing 
the database.

It would not significantly enhance the security in a way that SSL does by   in-transit encryption for the database.

With this authentication method, you don’t need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance. 
Instead, you use an authentication token.


Primary database instance fails:
The canonical name record (CNAME) is switched from the primary to standby instance.


Read Replicas:
It elastically scales out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.
Provides asynchronous replication and improves the performance of the primary database by taking read-heavy database workloads from it.

You can also create read replicas within a Region or between Regions for your Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and 
Oracle database instances encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).


There are 2 ways to use SSL to connect to your SQL Server DB instance:
– Force SSL for all connections — this happens transparently to the client, and the client doesn’t have to do any work to use SSL.
– Encrypt specific connections — this sets up an SSL connection from a specific client computer, and you must do work on the 
  client to encrypt connections.


Enhanced Monitoring is a feature of Amazon RDS. 
By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the CloudWatch Logs.

Differences between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring Metrics:  
	CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance, and 
	Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance.

Why Enhanced Monitoring for RDS: 
You do not have direct access to the instances/servers of your RDS database instance, unlike with your 
EC2 instances where you can install a CloudWatch agent or a custom script to get 
CPU and memory utilization of your instance.




Amazon RDS supports change data capture (CDC) for your DB instances running Microsoft SQL Server. 
	CDC captures changes that are made to the data in your tables. 
	It stores metadata about each change, which you can access later.
	After CDC is enabled on the database, you can start tracking specific tables. 




IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don’t need to use a password 
when you connect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token Each token has a lifetime of 15 minutes.


RDS events only provide operational events such as DB instance events, DB parameter group events, 
DB security group events, and DB snapshot events. What we need in the scenario is to capture 
data-modifying events (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) which can be achieved thru native functions or stored procedures.



Area:
=====
Multi-AZ deployment, which replicates data synchronously across AZs.
By default, the Multi-AZ feature is not enabled for the RDS instance.

In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary database (DB) instance and 
synchronously  replicates the data to an instance in a different AZ.




UseCase:
========
Build web and mobile applications.
Move to managed databases.



BillCost:
=========
AWS Free Tier with Amazon RDS
When you use Amazon RDS, you can choose to use on-demand DB instances or reserved DB instances.

It is comprised of 3 parts:
DB instance hours (per hour) . You can choose from different types of hosting depending on your need
Storage (per GiB per month),I/O requests (per 1 million requests per month): Storage and Operations. 
Storage is billed per gigabyte per month, and I/O is billed per million-request.
Provisioned IOPS (per IOPS per month) 
Backup storage (per GiB per month) –

Data transfer (per GB) – Data transfer in and out of your DB instance from or to the internet and other Regions.

For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don’t pay that fee but cross - region must pay.



Security:
=========
Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database
Security group and IAM controls the access to a DB instance.

RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database
IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL






35
##Aurora
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. 
An Aurora cluster volume can grow to a maximum size of 128 tebibytes (TiB). 

5 times faster than standard MySQL
3 times faster than standard PostgreSQL

Amazon Aurora provides built-in security, continuous backups, serverless compute, 
up to 15 read replicas, automated multi-Region replication, and integrations with other AWS services.

Non-Serverless DB cluster for Aurora is called a provisioned DB cluster. 
Aurora Serverless clusters and provisioned clusters both have the same kind of 
high-capacity, distributed, and highly available storage volume.

When you work with Amazon Aurora without Aurora Serverless (provisioned DB clusters), you can choose your DB instance class 
size and create Aurora Replicas to increase read throughput. 
If your workload changes, you can modify the DB instance class size and change the number of Aurora Replicas. 
This model works well when the database workload is predictable, because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload.

With Aurora Serverless , you can create a database endpoint without specifying the DB instance class size. 
You set the minimum and maximum capacity. 



• Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient


Features of Aurora:
• Automatic fail-over
• Backup and Recovery
• Isolation and security
• Industry compliance
• Push-button scaling
• Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
• Advanced Monitoring
• Routine Maintenance
• Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups



Aurora Replicas - Auto Scaling


Aurora – Custom Endpoints:
• Define a subset of Aurora Instances as a Custom Endpoint
• Example: Run analytical queries on specific replicas
• The Reader Endpoint is generally not used after defining Custom Endpoints


Aurora Serverless:
• Automated database instantiation and auto - scaling based on actual usage
• Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
• No capacity planning needed
• Pay per second, can be more cost -effective


Amazon Aurora and Aurora Serverless are two distinct products from AWS.
Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, autoscaling configuration for Amazon Aurora.



Aurora Multi-Master:
• In case you want immediate failover for write node (HA) –
• Every node does R/W - vs promoting a RR as the new master

Multi-master Aurora limitations.
	Currently, you can have a maximum of four DB instances in a multi-master cluster.
	Currently, all DB instances in a multi-master cluster must be in the same AWS Region.
	You can't enable cross-Region replicas from multi-master clusters.
	Multi-master clusters are not available in all Regions.


Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, 
allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS Regions.


Global Aurora:
Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas:
	• Useful for disaster recovery
	• Simple to put in place
• Aurora Global Database (recommended):
	• 1 Primary Region (read / write)
	• Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
	• Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
	• Helps for decreasing latency
	• Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
	• Typical cross-region replication takes less than 1 second





Aurora Machine Learning:
• Enables you to add ML-based predictions to your applications via SQL
• Simple, optimized, and secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML services
• Supported services
	• Amazon SageMaker (use with any ML model)
	• Amazon Comprehend (for sentiment analysis) 
• Use cases: fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendations


Aurora Replicas have two main purposes:
	for read operations for your application. 
    Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many 
	Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. 

	Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. 
	If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically 
	promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer. 
	Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability 
	Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.

Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL allow you to add up to 15 read replicas to each DB Instance. 
Amazon RDS for Oracle and SQL Server allow you to add up to 5 read replicas to each DB Instance.
An Aurora DB cluster can contain up to 15 Aurora Replicas. The Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones 
that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.



Failover rules priority tier:
	Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that 
	auto-scales up to 128TB per database instance. 
	It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, 
	point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and 
	replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).

For Amazon Aurora, each Read Replica is associated with a priority tier (0-15). 
In the event of a failover, Amazon Aurora will promote the Read Replica that has the highest priority 
(the lowest numbered tier). If two or more Aurora Replicas share the same priority, then 
Amazon RDS promotes the replica that is largest in size.
 
If two or more  Aurora Replicas share the same priority and size, then 
Amazon Aurora promotes an ramdomly replica in the same promotion tier.


creating a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and 
another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries.


Area:
=====
Multiple AWS Regions. 
It replicates your data with no impact on database performance, 
enables fast local reads with low latency in each Region, and provides disaster recovery from Region-wide outages.


UseCase:
========
Automatic fail-over
Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas, Useful for disaster recovery.



BillCost:
=========
Prices vary according to the region.
With Amazon Aurora Global Database, you 
pay for replicated write I/Os between the primary Region and each secondary Region.



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.

• Encryption at rest using 
• Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
• Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres)
• Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS)
• You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups
• You can’t SSH



RDS/Aurora - Backup and Monitoring
-------------------------------------------------

RDS Backups:
	• Automated backups
	• Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
	• Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
	• => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
	• 1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
	• Manual DB Snapshots:
		• Manually triggered by the user
		• Retention of backup for as long as you want
	• Trick: in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for storage. 
	  If you plan on stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot & restore instead
	  

RDS & Aurora Restore options:
• Restoring a RDS / Aurora backup or a snapshot creates a new database
	• Restoring MySQL RDS database from S3
		• Create a backup of your on-premises database
		• Store it on Amazon S3 (object storage)
		• Restore the backup file onto a new RDS instance running MySQL
	• Restoring MySQL Aurora cluster from S3
		• Create a backup of your on-premises database using Percona XtraBackup
		• Store the backup file on Amazon S3
		• Restore the backup file onto a new Aurora cluster running MySQL



Aurora Database Cloning:
• Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
• Faster than snapshot & restore
• The new DB cluster uses the same cluster volume and data as the original but will change when data updates are made.
• Very fast & cost-effective
• Useful to create a “staging” database from a “production” database without impacting the production database




++RDS & Aurora Security:
-------------------------------------------------
• At-rest encryption:
	• Database master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS – must be defined as launch time
	• If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
	• To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted
• In-flight encryption: TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
• IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pw)
• Security Groups: Control Network access to your RDS and Aurora DB
• No SSH available except on RDS Custom
• Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention






++RDS Proxy
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon RDS Proxy:
	• Fully managed database proxy for RDS
	• Allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database.
	• Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) and
	  minimize open connections (and timeouts)
	• Serverless, autoscaling, highly available (multi-AZ)
	• Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up 66%
	• Supports RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) and Aurora (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
	• No code changes required for most apps
	• Enforce IAM Authentication for DB, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
	• RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)





36
##ElastiCache
-------------------------------------------------
ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines: Memcached and Redis.
Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes.

ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached as RDS for other enign lke MySQL.
Distributed in-memory key-value environment.

Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a great choice for real-time transactional and analytical 
processing use cases such as caching, chat/messaging, gaming leaderboards, geospatial, machine learning, 
media streaming, queues, real-time analytics, and session store.

Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is a great choice for implementing an in-memory 
cache to decrease access latency, increase throughput, and ease the load off your relational or NoSQL database.
ElastiCache Memcached cannot be used as a cache to serve static content from S3.

Although you can integrate Redis with DynamoDB.

• Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
• Helps make your application stateless
• AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, 
  monitoring, failure recovery and backups
• Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes



REDIS:
	• Multi AZ with Auto-Failover
	• Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability
	• Data Durability using AOF persistence
	• Backup and restore features


Use Case:
	• Gaming Leaderboards are computationally complex
	• Redis Sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering
	• Each time a new element added, it’s ranked in real time, then added in correct order


MEMCACHED:
• Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
• No high availability (replication)
• Non persistent
• No backup and restore
• Multi-threaded architecture



ElastiCache (available as a managed service) can cache the results from anything. 
The difference here is that you need to manage invalidation and you must adjust your code to 
check the cache before querying the main query store.

Most fo the time, you’ll want to go w/DAX if you’re using DyanmoDB as a data store. 
Otherwise, use ElastiCache.

Elasticache is used as a caching layer in front of relational databases. 
It is not a good fit to store data in key-value pairs from the IoT sources.

 
Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is an ideal front-end for data stores like Amazon RDS or 
Amazon DynamoDB, providing a high-performance middle tier for applications with extremely 
high request rates and/or low latency requirements.


Area:
=====
Amazon ElastiCache is available in multiple AWS Regions. This means that you can launch ElastiCache clusters in 
locations that meet your requirements.
The new Global Datastore feature is available with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 5.0. 6 or above, and is 
supported on M5 and R5 nodes.



UseCase:
========
Gamming Leadboard
Accelerate application performance.
Ease backend database load.
Build low-latency data stores.
Primary data store for use cases that don't require durability like 
session stores, gaming leaderboards, streaming, and analytics



BillCost:
=========
AWS Free Tier.
You are charged hourly based on the number of nodes, node type, and pricing model you select. 
ElastiCache supports both on-demand nodes, which allow you to pay by hour with no long-term commitments, 
and reserved nodes, which offer discounts for customers who commit to either one-year or three-year terms.



Security:
=========
ElastiCache Securiry:
• Do not support IAM authentication
• IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security

Redis AUTH
• You can set a “password/token” when you create a Redis cluster
• This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
• Support SSL in flight encryption

Memcached
• Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

A security group controls the access to a cluster. It does so by allowing access to IP address ranges or 
Amazon EC2 instances that you specify. 







==| Route 53 Section
37
##Route53
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.



Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the 
geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.


Routing Policies:
Simple routing policy — Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, 
	for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.
Weighted routing policy — Use to route traffic to multiple resources in (%)percentage base that you specify.
Latency routing policy — Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to 
	route traffic to the region that provides the lest latency.
	Redirect to the resource that has the least latency close to user.
Failover routing policy — Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.
Geolocation routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.
Geoproximity routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, 
	optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another by bias number(0-99).

Multivalue answer routing policy — Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy 
	records selected at random.


• Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
• (must know) A / AAAA / CNAME / NS
• (advanced) CAA / DS / MX / NAPTR / PTR / SOA / TXT / SPF / SRV



In summary: Browser -> TLD -> NS -> SOA -> DNS record. 
The pipeline reverses when the correct DNS record is found.


A Record:
	A record (or Address record) value is always an IP address. The IP should be static. it 
	should not change frequently. For example, Elastic IPs in AWS are static IPs.

CNAME Record:
	CNAME record maps a name/ to another name value. It can never be an IP address. 

An A record for example.com (i.e. root/naked domain) points to the server IP address
A CNAME record for www.example.com points to example.com(A or AAAA). 


CNAME vs Alias:
	• AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront...) expose an AWS hostname:
	• lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com
CNAME:
		• The target or value is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record.
		• Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => anything.com)
		• ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka.something.mydomain.com) Destination.
		
Alias   : Alias record is an Amazon Route 53-specific virtual record. 
		• Maps a hostname to an AWS resource
		• An extension to DNS functionality
		• Automatically recognizes changes in the resource’s IP addresses
		• Unlike CNAME, it can be used for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex), e.g.: example.com
		• Alias Record is always of type A/AAAA for AWS resources (IPv4 / IPv6)
		• You can’t set the TTL
		
		

To simplify it we can say that example.com points to the server IP address using 
A record, and www.example.com points to the same address via example.com using a CNAME record. (Read Now – CNAME vs Alias)


Now a AWS service • lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com, how ?

CNAME Record Target only A (example.com i.e. root/naked domain) Record not IP or AWS services DNS name.
Alias Records Targets Aws Resource or Other Host.
A CNAME can’t be used for naked/root domain names. Root domain names must be mapped with either 
an A record or an Alias record (in Route 53).




A CNAME can’t be used providing for naked/root domain names ( (Zone Apex), e.g.: example.com). 
    A Record can providing root(example.com) domain but only support IP.
	Root domain names (example.com) must be mapped with either an A record or an Alias record (in Route 53).


ANS:  Alias record in Route 53 which handles this issue. 
	  Alias record will allow ELB DNS name (or any other DNS names produced by AWS services 
	  like CloudFront, S3 etc) to be mapped with the root domain (example.com) name in Route53.
	  
      Alias = lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com ->example.com

Amazon Route53 supports both forward (AAAA) and reverse (PTR) IPv6 records. 


Route53-TTL:
The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS recursive resolvers to cache information about this record.

High TTL – e.g., 24 hr
	• Less traffic on Route 53
	• Possibly outdated records
• Low TTL – e.g., 60 sec.
	• More traffic on Route 53 ($$)
	• Records are outdated for less time
	• Easy to change records
Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record


Route53 - Health Check:
Amazon Route 53 health checks monitor the health and performance of your web applications, 
web servers, and other resources. 
You can optionally configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for your health checks, so that you receive notification 
when a resource becomes unavailable.


Types of Amazon Route 53 health checks:

Health checks that monitor an endpoint
Health checks that monitor other health checks (calculated health checks)
Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms
Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller


Route 53 – Hosted Zones:
• A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains
	• Public Hosted Zones – contains records that specify how to route traffic on the 
	  Internet (public domain names) application1.mypublicdomain.com
	• Private Hosted Zones – contain records that specify how you route traffic within one or more 
	  VPCs (private domain names)application1.company.interna



Alias Records Targets:
	Elastic Load Balancers
	CloudFront distributions
	API Gateway
	Elastic Beanstalk
	S3 Website
	Global Accelerator
	VPC Interface Endpoints
	Route 53 record in the same hosted zone
Alias records do not support
	EC2 DNS endpoint
	RDS DNS endpoint
CNAME record can redirect DNS queries to any DNS record



Enable DNS Hostnames in your VPC — this creates and manages an invisible Route 53 Private Hosted zone.

Area:
=====
Route 53 is primarily a global service, but the following features support AWS Regions:
If you're using Route 53 Resolver to set up hybrid configurations, you create endpoints in
AWS Regions that you choose, 
and you specify IP addresses in multiple Availability Zones. 
For outbound endpoints, you create rules in the same Region where you created the endpoint.



UseCase:
========
Create, visualize, and scale complex routing relationships between records and policies 
with easy-to-use global DNS features.
Set routing policies to pre-determine and automate responses in case of failure, 
like redirecting traffic to alternative 

Availability Zones or Regions.
Assign and access custom domain names in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).


BillCost:
=========

Route 53 doesn’t charge for alias queries to AWS resources
Route 53 charges for CNAME queries

Managing hosted zones: You pay a monthly charge for each hosted zone managed with Route 53.
Managing domain names: You pay an annual charge for each domain name registered via or transferred 
 into Route 53.
Serving DNS queries: You incur charges for every DNS query answered by the Amazon Route 53 service, 
 except for queries to Alias A records.


Security:
=========
Filter and control outbound DNS traffic for your VPCs
Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall
	
AWS Shield Standard automatically protects your Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones from infrastructure 
layer DDoS attacks at no additional cost.

You can protect your domain from this type of attack, known as DNS spoofing or a man-in-the-middle attack, 
by configuring Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a protocol for securing DNS traffic. 
Amazon Route 53 supports DNSSEC signing as well as DNSSEC for domain registration.

##AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
-------------------------------------------------
ElasticBeanstalk  is PaaS (platform as a service) while CloudFormation,EC2 is IaC (infrastructure as code).

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with 
Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and 
Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

If not supported, you can write your custom platform (advanced)


Elastic Beanstalk takes care of the hosting infrastructure, coding language interpreter, operating system, 
security, https service and application layer. 


You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, 
load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. 


Elastic Beanstalk isn't great if you need a lot of environment variables. 
The simple reason is that Elastic Beanstalk has a hard limit of 4KB to store all key-value pairs.






Area:
=====
Regional.



UseCase:
======== 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.
Complete resource control: You have the freedom to select the AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instance type and processor 
type to run the workload on, that are optimal for your application. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.

==| S3 Storage and Data Management

39
##S3
-------------------------------------------------
An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage.
S3 is an object storage service. 

You can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification.

S3 Versioning-enabled buckets, help you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.

API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail.
S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www.

S3 in Amazon has two entities- called buckets and objects. 
Objects are stored inside buckets.
By default, the maximum number of buckets that can be created per account is 100.

Object values are the content of the body:
• Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload” cecommmand for obj>100MB

You can version your files in Amazon S3, It is enabled at the bucket level.


After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent 
read request immediately receives the latest version of the object. S3 also provides strong 
consistency for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the 
objects in a bucket with any changes reflected.


When you need to access S3 using a file system protocol, you should use File Gateway. 
You get a local cache in the gateway that provides high throughput and low latency over SMB.


• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)


Buckets can be in one of three states:
	Unversioned (the default)
	Versioning-enabled
	Versioning-suspended

• Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
• Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
	
After you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. 
But you can suspend versioning on that bucket.
You enable and suspend versioning at the bucket level.

There are two types of Lifecycle Management actions:
	Transaction Actions: This action defines objects’ transition from one storage class to another.
	Expiration Actions: This action deletes objects in the Amazon S3 bucket.


Amazon S3 Storage Classes:
	S3 Standard
	S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
	S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Amazon S3 supports a waterfall model for transitioning between storage classes.

There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3:
	• SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
	• SSE-KMS: AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
	• SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
	• Client Side Encryption
	
EmaxTips:It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation for the exam


SSE-S3:
	• SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by AmazonS3 its self.
	• Object is encrypted server side
	• AES-256 encryption type
	• Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

SSE-KMS:
	• SSE-KMS: everage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
	• KMS Advantages: user control + Audit trail
	• Object is encrypted server side
	• Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"

SSE-C:
	• SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
	• SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
	• Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
	• HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
	• Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

Client Side Encryption:
	• Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client 
	• Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3 
	• Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3 
	• Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle





S3 Security:
	IAM policies                 = Manage multiple Users to do under a single AWS account about S3 bucket or objects .
	Bucket policies,             = With Bucket policies and Access point policies, define rules  which apply all requests to S3 resources.
	Access point policies        = Do
	Access Control Lists         = With ACLs only to other AWS accounts, not to users in your account. grant specific permissions (i.e. READ, WRITE, FULL_CONTROL) to specific users (customers who prefer to use exclusively policies for access control)for an individual bucket or object.
	Query String Authentication  = With Query String Authentication, create a URL to an S3 object which is only valid for a limited time. 
	VPC endpoint policies,       = withh VPC endpoint, they can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the S3 resources to which will are connecting. Also S3 bucket policies to control access to buckets from specific endpoints or specific VPCs.
	SCPs in AWS Organizations    = SCPs are a type of AWS Organizations policy that customers can use to manage permissions in their organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in an organization.
	S3 Block Public Access       = S3 Block Public Access provides settings for- access points, buckets, and accounts to  manage public access to  S3 resources.

With MFA Delete, Encryption, Cross-Account Access, Requester Pays Buckets and Monitoring.

User based
	• IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console(Web).
Resource Based
	• Bucket Policies(JSON based policies) - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account.
	• Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
	• Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
	
Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
	• the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
	• AND there’s no explicit DENY


Use S3 bucket policy to:- 
	• Grant public access to the bucket 
	• Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
	• Grant access to another account (Cross Account)



S3 Bucket Policies: 
	• JSON based policies 
	• Resources: buckets and objects 
	• Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny 
	• Effect: Allow / Deny 
	• Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

Use S3 bucket for policy to: 
	• Grant public access to the bucket 
	• Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
	• Grant access to another account (CrossAccount)



CORS:
• An origin is a scheme (protocol), host (domain) and port
• Web Browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
	The requests won’t be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the
	requests, using CORS Headers (ex: Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
	
• If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers
• You can allow for a specific origin or for * (all origins)	
ExamTip:It’s a popular exam question


S3 Sync command:
	The aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between S3 buckets. 
	The sync command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the 
	source bucket but that aren't in the target bucket.
	 
	The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different LastModified dates 
	than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket copies only the 
	current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied.



There are no S3 data transfer charges when data is transferred in from the internet. 
Also with S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated. Therefore the junior 
scientist does not need to pay any transfer charges for the image upload because S3TA did not 
result in an accelerated transfer.


If you have workloads that cater to a global client base, AWS recommends that you use AWS Global Accelerator. 
If you have workloads hosted in a single AWS Region and used by clients in and around the same 
Region, you can use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer to manage your resources.

If you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read 
performance to 55,000 read requests per second.



When you use bucket default settings, you don't specify a Retain Until Date. 
Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years.
ByDefault its a period like: 1 year.

When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date 
for the object version.





Encryption:
	Server-side Encryption using
		Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3 with AES-256)
		AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS with Audit-trails)
		Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
	Client-side Encryption using
		AWS KMS-managed customer master key
		client-side master key



When using an AWS KMS-Managed customer master key to enable client-side data encryption, you provide an 
AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. 

On the other hand, when you use client-side master key for client-side data encryption, your client-side master keys 
and your unencrypted data are never sent to AWS.


S3  replicating the objects to the destination bucket takes about 15 minutes. 
Take note that the requirement in the scenario is to aggregate the data in the fastest way.
Use Transfer Acclearation.


Area:
=====
Global but Data is Regional.
The user interface shows all your buckets, in all regions. 
But buckets exist in a specific region and you need to specify that region when you create a bucket.





UseCase:
========
S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www.
Build a data lake:Run big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), 
and high performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock data insights.
Back up and restore critical data: Meet Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).
Archive data at the lowest cost.
Run cloud-native applications.
 
 
 
BillCost:

Amazon S3 charges you only for what you actually use, with no hidden fees and no overage charges.
Bucket pricing varies by region.



Security:
=========
IAM to create users and manage their respective access; 
ACLs (Resource base) to make individual objects accessible to authorized users; 
Bucket policies to configure permissions  for all objects within a single S3 bucket;

##Instance Metadata
-------------------------------------------------
EC2 Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. 
AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is powerful but one of the least known features to developers.

• It allows AWS EC2 instances to ”learn about themselves” without using an IAM Role for that purpose.
• The URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
• You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you CANNOT retrieve the IAM Policy.

Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instance




AWS SDK: Good to know: if you don’t specify or configure a default region, then us-east-1 will be chosen by default.






==| Advanced S3
41
##S3 MFA
-------------------------------------------------
MFA (multi factor authentication) forces user to generate a code on a device 
(usually a mobile phone or hardware) before doing important operations on S3.

• To use MFA-Delete, enable Versioning on the S3 bucket
• You will need MFA to
	• permanently delete an object version
	• suspend versioning on the bucket
• You won’t need MFA for
	• enabling versioning
	• listing deleted versions
• Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA-Delete
• MFA-Delete currently can only be enabled using the CLI





42
##S3 Access Logs
-------------------------------------------------
S3 Access Logs provides detailed records for the requests that are made to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Provide the name of the target bucket. 
This bucket is where you want Amazon S3 to save the access logs as objects. 

Both the source and target buckets must be in the same AWS Region and owned by the same account.
That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools.

S3 Access Logs: Warning
• Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket
• It will create a logging loop, and your bucket will grow in size exponentially

There is no extra charge for enabling server access logging on an Amazon S3 bucket.




43
##S3 Replication 
-------------------------------------------------
Must enable versioning in source and destination.

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across  
Amazon S3 buckets same AWS account or by different accounts. 
You can replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multiple destination buckets. 

If you specify an object version ID to delete, Amazon S3 deletes that object version in the source bucket. 
But it doesn't replicate the deletion in the destination bucket. In other words, 
it doesn't delete the same object version from the destination bucket. 
This protects data from malicious deletions.

When you add a replication rule to a bucket, the rule is enabled by default, 
so it starts working as soon as you save it.

S3 Replication supports two-way replication between two or more buckets in the same or different AWS Regions. 


• CRR(Cross Region Replication) - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
• SRR(Same Region Replication)  – Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test.


After activating, only new objects are replicated
• Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using S3 Batch Replication
• Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication


For DELETE operations:
• Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
• Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)
• There is no “chaining” of replication


S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure 
transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 

You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console.



UseCase:
========
S3 Replication for:
Data redundancy – If you need to maintain multiple copies of your data in the same, 
or different AWS Regions, with different encryption types, or across different accounts.
Replicate objects to more cost-effective storage classes.
Maintain object copies under a different account.





44
##S3 Pre-signed URLs
-------------------------------------------------
S3 objects are private. Only the object owner has permission to access them. 

Can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
• For downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
• For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
• Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for GET / PUT
• Valid for a default of 3600 seconds (60mm or 1Hour), can change timeout with --expires-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS] argument

UseCase :
• Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video on your S3 bucket
• Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically
• Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in our bucket






45
##S3 Storage Class
-------------------------------------------------

S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level, and a single bucket can contain all Class type object.

Amazon S3 Storage Classes:
	S3 Standard
	S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
	S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	S3 Glacier Deep Archive

S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year


S3 Standard – General Purpose:
	• 99.99% Availability
	• Used for frequently accessed data
	• Low latency and high throughput
	• Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution


•S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	• For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
	• Lower cost than S3 Standard
	• 99.9% Availability
	• Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups

S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
	• Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
	• Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
	• There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	• Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
	• Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
	• Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
	• Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
	• Deep Archive Access tier (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days



•S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA for re-creatable data) 
	• In a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
	• 99.5% Availability
    • Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data, or data you can recreate
S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
 
S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed and 
re-creatable data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. 
The minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-IA.


S3 Glacier Storage Classes:
	• Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
	• Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost
	• S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
		• Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
		• Minimum storage duration of 90 days
	• S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier):
		• Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) – free
		• Minimum storage duration of 90 days
	• S3 Glacier Deep Archive – for long term storage:
		• Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
		• Minimum storage duration of 180 days

You can transition objects between storage classes 
Moving objects can be automated using a lifecycle configuration


The minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from 
S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-IA or S3 Standard-IA.


No retraival free for S3Standerd and InteletencyTaring


45
##S3 Lifecycle | Rule
-------------------------------------------------
An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that S3 applies to a group of objects. 
S3 Object Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

Transition actions: It defines when objects are transitioned to another storage class.
	• Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
	• Move to Glacier for archiving after 6 months
Expiration actions: configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
	• Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days
	• Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled)
	• Can be used to delete incomplete multi-part uploads
• Rules can be created for a certain prefix (ex - s3://mybucket/mp3/*)
• Rules can be created for certain objects tags (ex - Department: Finance)



Amazon S3 supports a waterfall model for transitioning between storage classes.

Supported lifecycle transitions:
	The S3 Standard storage class to any other storage class.
	The S3 Standard-IA storage class to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
	The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
	The S3 One Zone-IA storage class to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
	The S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
	The S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.
	Any storage class to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.

Unsupported lifecycle:
	Any storage class to the S3 Standard storage class.
	Any storage class to the Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) class.
	The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the S3 Standard-IA storage class.
	The S3 One Zone-IA storage class to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and  S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage classes.
	
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html




46
##S3 Analytics
-------------------------------------------------
• You can setup S3 Analytics to help determine when to transition objects from Standard to Standard_IA
• Does not work for ONEZONE_IA or GLACIER
• Report is updated daily
• Takes about 24h to 48h hours to first start
• Good first step to put together Lifecycle Rules (or improve them)!


Storage class analysis does not give recommendations for transitions to the ONEZONE_IA or 
S3 Glacier storage classes. Only Standard to Standard-IA


S3 – Baseline Performance
-------------------------------------------------
• Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200 ms
• Your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and
  5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket

3500 and 5500 for Each S3 prefix can support these request rates, making it simple to increase 
performance significantly. 
  
Performance scales per prefix, so you can use as many prefixes as you need in parallel to achieve the required throughput. 
There are no limits to the number of prefixes.



S3 – KMS Limitation:
• If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits
• When you upload, it calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API
• When you download, it calls the Decrypt KMS API


Multi-Part upload:
• recommended for files > 100MB, must use for files > 5GB
• Can help parallelize uploads (speedup transfers)

S3 Transfer Acceleration:
• Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the 
  S3 bucket in the target region.
• Compatible with multi-part upload



There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. 

If you spread reads across all four prefixes evenly, you can achieve 22,000
requests per second for GET and HEAD (4*5500)

S3 – KMS Limitation:
• Count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region)
• You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console



47
##S3 Select & Glacier Select
-------------------------------------------------
Retrive subset of object date. Get Data in a object by object key.
• Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server side filtering
• Can filter by rows & columns (simple SQL statements)
• Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side






48
##S3 Event Nofifications
-------------------------------------------------
Can create as many “S3 events” as desired
S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer.

You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain 
events happen in your S3 bucket. 
To enable notifications, add a notification configuration that identifies the events that you want 
Amazon S3 to publish. 
Make sure that it also identifies the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. 

You store this configuration in the notification subresource that's associated with a bucket


S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge:
	• Advanced filtering options with JSON rules (metadata, object size, name...)
	• Multiple Destinations – ex Step Functions, Kinesis Streams / Firehose…
	• EventBridge Capabilities – Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery


UseCase:
========
Amazon S3 supports For Event:Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, Lambda.

S3 cannot directly write data into SNS, although it can certainly use S3 event notifications to 
send an event to SNS.



49
##S3 Requester pays
-------------------------------------------------
In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs that are 
associated with their bucket. 

However, you can configure a bucket to be a Requester Pays bucket. With Requester Pays buckets, 
the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket. 
The bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.


Helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts
The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)


UseCase:
========
Typically, you configure buckets to be Requester Pays buckets when you want to share data but not incur 
charges associated with others accessing the data. 





51
##S3 Lock | Vault Lock | Glacier Vault Lock
-------------------------------------------------
S3 Glacier Vault Lock helps you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual 
S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. 

You can specify controls such as "write once read many" (WORM) in a Vault Lock policy  and 
lock the policy from future edits.

After a Vault Lock policy is locked, the policy can no longer be changed or deleted.


S3 Object Lock (versioning must be enabled):
• Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
• Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time

	• Retention mode - Compliance:
		• Object versions can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user
		• Objects retention modes can't be changed, and retention periods can't be shortened
	• Retention mode - Governance:
		• Most users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings
		• Some users have special permissions to change the retention or delete the object
	• Retention Period: protect the object for a fixed period, it can be extended
	• Legal Hold:
		• protect the object indefinitely, independent from retention period
		• can be freely placed and removed using the s3:PutObjectLegalHold IAM permission




S3 – Access Points:
	• Each Access Point gets its own DNS and policy to limit who can access it
	• A specific IAM user / group
	• One policy per Access Point => Easier to manage than complex bucket policies



S3 Object Lambda:
S3 Object Lambda supports only GetObject requests. 
Use AWS Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application.
Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 Access Point and S3 Object Lambda Access Points.

Use Cases:
	Redacting personally identifiable information for analytics or non-production environments.
	Converting across data formats, such as converting XML to JSON.
	Augmenting data with information from other services or databases.
	Compressing or decompressing files as they are being downloaded.
	Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details, such as the user who 
	requested the object.
	Implementing custom authorization rules to access data.

Element:
The S3 bucket
An S3 Bucket Access Point
An S3 Object Lambda Access Point

ClientGetReqRes->S3ObjectLambdaAccessPoint->S3BucketAccessPoint->S3


S3 Batch Operations:
• Perform bulk operations on existing S3 objects with asingle request, example:
	• Modify object metadata & properties
	• Copy objects between S3 buckets
	• Encrypt un-encrypted objects
	• Modify ACLs, tags
	• Restore objects from S3 Glacier
	• Invoke Lambda function to perform custom action on each object
• A job consists of a list of objects, the action to perform, and optional parameters
• S3 Batch Operations manages retries, tracks progress, sends completion notifications, generate reports …
• You can use S3 Inventory to get object list and use S3 Select to filter your objects




Bucket Policies:
-------------------------------------------------
Bucket policies in Amazon S3 can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects 
within a single bucket. 
Policies can be attached to users, groups, or Amazon S3 buckets, enabling centralized management of permissions. 

With bucket policies, you can grant users within your 
AWS Account or other AWS Accounts access to your Amazon S3 resources.

IAM				->AccNot->UserYes
ACL				->AccYes->UserNot
BucketPolicies	->AccYes->UserYes

With IAM policies, you can only grant users within your own AWS account permission to access your Amazon S3 resources.
With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your Amazon S3 resources. 





S3 Transfer Acceleratio
-------------------------------------------------
Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket.

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over 
long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 

Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of 
Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. 

As the data arrives at an edge location, 
data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket.



You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting. 

When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, 
you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version.


S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA have a minimum storage duration charge of 30 days 
(so instead of 24 hours, you end up paying for 30 days). 

S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA also have 
retrieval charges (as the results are heavily referenced by other parts of the analytics pipeline, 
so the retrieval costs would be pretty high).





==| Global Infrastructure
52
##CloudFront 
-------------------------------------------------
UserReq->CloudFront->EdgeLocation->WebServer


AWS CloudFront is a globally-distributed network.
CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called EdgeLocation.

CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC.


CloudFront is Amazon’s content delivery network that is primarily used to speed up websites. 
It’s particularly useful for large, static assets—like images and videos. 

AWS CloudFront is a globally-distributed network offered by Amazon Web Services, which securely 
transfers content such as software, SDKs, videos, etc., to the clients, with high transfer speed.


Amazon CloudFront uses standard cache control headers you set on your files to identify 
static and dynamic content. You can use different origins for different types of content on 
a single site – e.g. Amazon S3 for static objects, Amazon EC2 for dynamic content, and 
custom origins for third-party content.



• Content Delivery Network (CDN)
• Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
• 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
• DDoS protection, integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
• Can expose external HTTPS and can talk to internal HTTPS backends


Performance
CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and 
dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery).

Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by 
proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
It use dedicated AWS Global Network.


CloudFront– Origins:
S3 bucket 
	• For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
	• Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
	  Private S3 bucket file can be access by ClourFront using OAI
	• CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3) 
Custom Origin (HTTP) 
	• Application Load Balancer 
	• EC2 instance 
	• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website) 
	• Any HTTP backend you want



CloudFront Geo Restriction:
	• You can restrict who can access your distribution
	• Whitelist: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the 
	  countries on a list of approved countries.
	• Blacklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a 
	  blacklist of banned countries.
	• The “country” is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database
	• Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content


CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication:
CloudFront:
	• Global Edge network
	• Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
	• Great for static content that must be available everywhere
S3 Cross Region Replication:
	• Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
	• Files are updated in near real-time
	• Read only
	• Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions


CloudFront Signed URL / Signed Cookies:
• You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
• We can use CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie. We attach a policy with:
	• Includes URL expiration
	• Includes IP ranges to access the data from
	• Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs)
• How long should the URL be valid for?
	• Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
	• Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
	
• Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
• Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)


CloudFront Signed URL vs S3Pre-Signed URL:

Only S3 refers to them as Pre-signed URLs; 
CloudFront refers to them as Signed URLs and Signed Cookies.

-Pre-signed URLs use the owner’s security credentials to grant.

-Restrict access to files in CloudFront edge caches
-Restrict access to files in your Amazon S3 bucket (unless you’ve configured it as a website endpoint)
-You can configure CloudFront to require that users access your files 
 using either signed URLs or signed cookies.
-OAI prevents users from viewing your S3 files by simply using the direct URL for the file. 
 Instead, they would need to access it through a CloudFront URL.


Lambda Http HTTP  errors:
Set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins. 
Specify one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which 
CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific 
HTTP status code failure responses.


When you create or update Lambda functions that use environment variables, 
AWS Lambda encrypts them using the AWS Key Management Service. 
When your Lambda function is invoked, those values are decrypted and made available to the Lambda code.


Although Lambda encrypts the environment variables in your function by default, 
the sensitive information would still be visible to other users who have access to the Lambda console. 
This is because Lambda uses a default KMS key to encrypt the variables, which is 
usually accessible by other users. 

Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files in your CloudFront distribution by modifying your application to 
determine whether a user should have access to your content. 
For members, send the required Set-Cookie headers to the viewer which will unlock the content only to them.




Use signed URLs for the following cases:
– You want to use an RTMP distribution. Signed cookies aren’t supported for RTMP distributions.
– You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your application.
– Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn’t support cookies.

Use signed cookies for the following cases:
– You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files for a video in HLS format or 
  all of the files in the subscribers’ area of a website.
– You don’t want to change your current URLs.



Create an Origin Access Identity (OAI) for CloudFront and grant access to the objects in your S3 bucket to that OAI.


The Cache-Control and Expires headers control how long objects stay in the cache. 
The Cache-Control max-age directive lets you specify how long (in seconds) you want an object to remain in the cache before 
CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server. 
The minimum expiration time CloudFront supports is 0 seconds for web distributions and 3600 (60 mm or 1har) seconds for RTMP distributions.


CloudFront Functions are just lightweight functions in JavaScript for high-scale, latency-sensitive CDN customizations and 
not for enforcing security. 

A CloudFront Function runtime environment offers submillisecond startup times which allows your application to scale 
immediately to handle millions of requests per second. But again, this can’t be used to restrict access to your files.


Serve the private content via CloudFront only:
	A better solution is to set up an origin access identity (OAI) then use Signed URL or Signed Cookies in your 
	CloudFront web distribution.
 

Amazon S3 Storage Lens feature just provides a single view of object storage usage and activity across your entire Amazon S3 storage.
S3 Storage Lens is the first cloud storage analytics solution to provide a single view of object storage usage and 
activity across hundreds, or even thousands, of accounts in an organization, with drill-downs to generate insights 
at the account, bucket, or even prefix level.




Area:
=====
Global services.
Global Accelerator and CloudFront both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world.


UseCase:
========
-Deliver fast, secure websites
-Accelerate dynamic content delivery and APIs
-Stream live and on-demand video
-Distribute patches and updates


CloudFront is a good fit for HTTP use cases
Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or VoIP, 
as well as for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.

Caching:
CloudFront supports Edge caching
Global Accelerator does not support Edge Caching.

Geo-Targeting:
Geo-Targeting is a concept where businesses can show personalized content to their audience 
based on their geographic location without changing the URL. 

This helps you create customized content for the audience of a specific 
geographical area, keeping their needs in the forefront.




BillCost:
=========
AWS CloudFront is in Free Tier
Pricing varies by usage type, geographical region, and feature selection.

Charge for storage in an S3 bucket.
	Charge for serving objects from edge locations.
	Data Transfer Out
	Charge for submitting data to your origin.
	Data Transfer Out
	HTTP/HTTPS Requests
	Invalidation Requests,
	Dedicated IP Custom SSL certificates associated with a CloudFront distribution.
You also incur a surcharge for HTTPS requests, and an additional surcharge for requests that 
also have field-level encryption enabled

53
++CloudFront - price Classes
-------------------------------------------------
• CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world 
• The cost of data out per edge location varies

CloudFront – Price Classes:
• You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction
Three price classes:
	1. Price Class All: all regions – best performance
	2. Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
	3. Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions






++CloudFront Cache Invalidation
-------------------------------------------------
• In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn’t know about it and will only get the
  refreshed content after the TTL has expired
• However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) 
  by performing a CloudFront Invalidation.
• You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)


Global users for our application:
• You have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly.
• They go over the public internet, which can add a lot of latency due to many hops
• We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency


Unicast IP vs Anycast IP:
• Unicast IP: one server holds one IP address.
• Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one.






54
##Global Accelerator 
-------------------------------------------------
In summary, Global Accelerator is a fast/reliable pipeline between user and application.

• Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application
• 2 Anycast IP are created for your application(Two IP for availability !)
• The Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge Locations
• The Edge locations send the traffic to your application


AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve the performance of your applications 
for local and global users.

With Global Accelerator, you are provided two global static public IPs that act as a 
fixed entry point to your application,  improving availability. 

On the back end, add or remove your AWS application endpoints, 
such as Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, EC2 Instances, 
and Elastic IPs without making user-facing changes. 

Global Accelerator automatically re-routes your traffic to your nearest healthy available endpoint 
to mitigate endpoint failure.

Consistent Performance:
• Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
• No issue with client cache (because the IP doesn’t change)
• Internal AWS network


AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront:
	• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
	• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
• CloudFront
	• Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
	• Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
• Global Accelerator
	• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	• Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
	• Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
	• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover


AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic 
that is directed to endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control 
the percentage of traffic that is directed to an endpoint group (an AWS region where 
your application is deployed).


With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the 
green environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet 
resolvers, traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.



AWS Global Accelerator for availability and performance of your applications with local or global users.
CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.

Direct Connect cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.
 
 
AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect because this service is more suitable for non-HTTP use cases, 
such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically 
require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.
 
Moreover, there is no direct way that you can integrate AWS Global Accelerator with Amazon S3.

Area:
=====
Global Accelerator is a global service.



UseCase:
========
Global Accelerator also provides fast regional failover.



BillCost:
=========
In AWS Global Accelerator, you are charged for each accelerator that is provisioned and the amount of traffic in the dominant 
direction that flows through the accelerator.



Security:
=========
only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted

##Snow Family
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations
If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices.

We setup a Snowball Edge/Snowcone device to do edge computing.


Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS. 
It is a cost-effective way to transfer data offline. 


AWS snow family service model is of three types: 

AWS snow cone: 
	Snow cone is the most compact and portable device weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1kg). 
	It is available in HDD and SDD options. Snowcone is ruggedized, secure, and purpose-built for use outside of a 
	traditional data centre. 
	Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data.


AWS snowball: 
	Snowball is available as compute optimized device and storage optimized device. 
	These devices are suited for extreme conditions, tamper-proof, and highly secure. 
	Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery
	Pay per data transfer job.

AWS snowmobile: 
	AWS snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data migration device which is used to move extremely large data. 
	It migrates up to 100PB in a 45-foot-long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck. 
	• High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
	• Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB


Snow Family – Edge Computing:
• Process data while it’s being created on an edge location
• A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
• These locations may have
	• Limited / no internet access
	• Limited / no easy access to computing power
• We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
• Use cases of Edge Computing:
	• Preprocess data
	• Machine learning at the edge
	• Transcoding media streams
	
• Snowcone (smaller,  online and offline)
	• 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access
	• USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
	• Edge computing
	• 8 TBs of usable storage
	Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data
• Snowball Edge(offline) – Compute Optimized
	• 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
	• Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
	• 42 TB usable storage, 
	• 42 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
• Snowball Edge(offline) – Storage Optimized
	• Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
	• 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
	• Object storage clustering available, 80 TB HDD
• All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
• Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing


For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball. 


AWS OpsHub (a software you install on your computer / laptop) to manage your Snow Family Device.
Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly.
You must use Amazon S3 first, in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy.


Snow Family – Usage Process:
1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you’re done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped.



Area:
=====
Global.


UseCase:
========
Process and analyze data locally: Run Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) on Amazon EC2 and distribute 
AWS Lambda code using machine learning (ML) or other applications on Snowball Edge devices.


BillCost:
=========
Snowmobile pricing is based on the amount of data stored on the truck per month.

With AWS Snowball, you pay only for your use of the device and for data transfer out of AWS. 
There are two ways to pay for AWS Snowball: on-demand and committed upfront pricing.



Security:
=========
All data moved to AWS Snow Family devices is automatically encrypted with 256-bit encryption keys that are 
managed by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). 
Encryption keys are never stored on the device so your data stays secure during transit.

##FSx | ++Amazon FSx
-------------------------------------------------
Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
Four widely-used file systems: 
 - NetApp ONTAP, 
 - OpenZFS, 
 - Windows File Server 
 - Lustre.
 

FSx for Windows(Service Message Block (SMB) protocol):
FSx for Window Supports Microsoft's Distributed File System (DFS).
AWS Managed Microsoft AD does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS).
Microsoft SQL Server on AWS does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS).

	Amazon FSx for Windows is accessible from Windows, Linux, and MacOS compute instances and devices. 
	Thousands of compute instances and devices can access a file system concurrently. 
	Amazon FSx File Gateway provides low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in the cloud.

	• FSx for Windows is a fully managed Windows file system share drive
	• Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
	• Microsoft Active Directory integration, ACLs, user quotas
	• Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
	• Supports Microsoft's Distributed File System (DFS) Namespaces (group files across multiple FS)

	• Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
	• Storage Options:
		• SSD – latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, …)
		• HDD – broad spectrum of workloads (home directory, CMS, …)
	• Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect)
	• Can be configured to be Multi-AZ (high availability)
	• Data is backed-up daily to S3


FSx for Windows does not allow you to present S3 objects as files and does not allow you to 
write changed data back to S3. 
Therefore you cannot reference the "cold data" with quick access for reads and updates at low cost.

 

Amazon FSx for Lustre:
 FSx for Lustre does not support Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS), so this option is incorrect.
	• Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
	• The name Lustre is derived from “Linux” and “cluster
	• Machine Learning, High Performance Computing (HPC)
	• Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
	• Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
	• Storage Options:
		• SSD – low-latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations
		• HDD – throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations
		• Seamless integration with S3, r/w (through FSx)
		• Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)

FSx Lustre - File System Deployment Options:
•Scratch File System
	• Temporary storage
	• Data is not replicated (doesn’t persist if file server fails)
	• High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
	• Usage: short-term processing, optimize costs
• Persistent File System
	• Long-term storage
	• Data is replicated within same AZ
	• Replace failed files within minutes
	• Usage: long-term processing, sensitive data.

FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon S3.
FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion 
as well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3.


Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP:
	• Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS
	• File System compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol
	• Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS
	• Works with:
		• Linux
		• Windows
		• MacOS
		• VMware Cloud on AWS
		• Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
		• Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
	• Storage shrinks or grows automatically
	• Snapshots, replication, low-cost, compression and data de-duplication
	• Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)



Amazon FSx for OpenZFS:
	• Managed OpenZFS file system on AWS
	• File System compatible with NFS (v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2)
	• Move workloads running on ZFS to AWS
	• Works with:
		• Linux
		• Windows
		• MacOS
		• VMware Cloud on AWS
		• Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
		• Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
	• Up to 1,000,000 IOPS with < 0.5ms latency
	• Snapshots, compression and low-cost
	• Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)



Hybrid Cloud for Storage:
• S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?
  Ans: AWS Storage Gateway.


AWS Storage Cloud Native Options:
	Block: Amazon EBS, EC2 Instance Store
	File: Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx 
	Object:Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier




Area:
=====
Regional Service.



UseCase:
========
Migrate Windows file servers to AWS
Accelerate hybrid workloads
Simplify virtual desktops and streaming



BillCost:
=========
With Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, you pay only for the resources you use and there are no minimum 
fees or setup charges. 
While pricing is quoted on a monthly basis, your usage is prorated by the hour, and you are billed for 
your average usage over a month.



Security:
=========
You can configure security group rules and control network access to your Amazon FSx file systems.
Amazon FSx is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
You can also tag your Amazon FSx resources and control the actions that your 
IAM users and groups can take based on those tags.

AWS FSx was designed to meet high security standards. 
The service has ISO, PCI-DSS, and SOC certifications, and is also HIPAA eligible.







57
##Storage Gateway
-------------------------------------------------
Bridge between on-premises data to AWS, no aws-to-aws

Storage Gateway provides a standard set of storage protocols such as 
iSCSI, SMB, and NFS, which allow you to use AWS storage without rewriting your existing applications. 



SMB or NFS interface->FileGateway
iSCSI block storage-> Volume Gateway

File gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.

Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage.

3 types of Storage Gateway:
	• File Gateway
	• Volume Gateway
	• Tape Gateway
	
Exam Tip: You need to know the differences between all 3!
AWS Storage Gateway doesn’t support EFS filesystem.

++
• S3 File Gateway
• FSx File Gateway
• Volume Gateway
• Tape Gateway



S3 File Gateway:
Used for flat files only, stored directly on S3.
	• Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
	• Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
	• Supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard IA, S3 One Zone A, S3 Intelligent Tiering
	• Transition to S3 Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy
	• Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
	• SMB Protocol has integration with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication

You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. 
You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3.




FSx File Gateway:
	File Gateway synchronizes changed data to FSx for Windows File Server in the background. 
	With these capabilities, you can consolidate all of your on-premises file share data in AWS on FSx for 
	Windows File Server and benefit from protected, resilient, fully managed file systems.
		• Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
		• Local cache for frequently accessed data
		• Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory...)
		• Useful for group file shares and home directories




Volume Gateway:
	• Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
	• Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes!
		• Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
		• Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
Cached Volume mode – the entire dataset is stored on S3, and a cache of the most frequently 
accessed data is cached on-site.
Stored Volume mode – the entire dataset is stored on-site and is asynchronously backed up to 
S3 (EBS point-in-time snapshots). 
Snapshots are incremental and compressed.



Tape Gateway:
	• Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
	• With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
	• Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
	• Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
	• Works with leading backup software vendors 

It is supported by NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam, etc. 
Instead of using physical tape, they are using virtual tape,  and these virtual tapes are 
further stored in Amazon S3.


Storage Gateway – Hardware appliance:
	• Using Storage Gateway means you need on-premises virtualization
	• Otherwise, you can use a Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance
	• You can buy it on amazon.com

	• Works with File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway
	• Has the required CPU, memory, network, SSD cache resources
	• Helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers

Needs additional setup on-premises



File gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.

Volume Gateway to present cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications. 
Volume Gateway does not support NFS interface.
Tape Gateway does not support NFS interface.


Area:
=====
Storage Gateway – Regional
AWS Storage Gateway stores volume, snapshot, and tape data in the AWS region in which the gateway is activated



UseCase:
========
Provide cloud-based backup for on-premises files and database applications for low-cost, 
virtually unlimited scale.



BillCost:
=========
This pricing is based on data transferred "in" to and "out" of the AWS Storage Gateway Service by  gateway, 
and it varies by region and gateway host. 



Security:
=========
All data transferred between the gateway and AWS storage is encrypted using SSL.







58
##Transfer Famamily 
-------------------------------------------------
A fully-managed service for file transfers into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using the FTP protocol


The data transfer between AWS Transfer Family servers and Amazon S3 happens over internal AWS networks and doesn’t 
traverse the public internet. 

Because of this, you do not need to use AWS PrivateLink for data transfered from the 
AWS Transfer Family server to Amazon S3.

• Supported Protocols
	• AWS Transfer for FTP (File Transfer Protocol (FTP))
	• AWS Transfer for FTPS (File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS))
	• AWS Transfer for SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP))
• Managed infrastructure, Scalable, Reliable, Highly Available (multi-AZ)
• Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
• Store and manage users’ credentials within the service
• Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP, Okta, 
  Amazon Cognito, custom)


Seamlessly migrate, automate, and monitor your file transfer workflows into and out of 
Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS using the SFTP, FTPS, and FTP protocols.


AWS Transfer Family supports the following clients:
OpenSSH (macOS and Linux)
WinSCP (Microsoft Windows only)
Cyberduck (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
FileZilla (Windows, macOS, and Linux)


File Transfer Workflows – MFTW:
	1)File Transfer Workflows – MFTW is a fully managed, serverless File Transfer Workflow service 
	    that makes it easy to set up, run, automate, and monitor the processing of uploaded files.
	2)MFTW can be used to automate various processing steps such as copying, tagging, scanning, filtering, 
		compressing/decompressing, and encrypting/decrypting the data that is transferred using Transfer Family.
	3)MFTW provides end-to-end visibility for tracking and auditability.



Area:
=====
Regional.


UseCase:
========
sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP,


BillCost:
=========
You pay only for access-enabled protocols, the amount of data (gigabytes) uploaded and downloaded 
over SFTP/FTPS/FTP, or the number of messages sent or received over AS2. 

Additional charges:
You are charged standard storage request and data transfer rates to store, read, and write 
to and from Amazon S3. 
You are also charged standard rates for domain name lookups using Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudTrail, and 
Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Events.



Security:
=========
Security is a shared responsibility.






##DataSync
-------------------------------------------------
Schedule data sync from on-premises to AWS, or AWS to AWS.
DataSync makes it easier to move data over the network between storage systems and services.

S3-to-S3
AWS DataSync copy data and metadata between AWS Storage Services

• Move large amount of data to and from
	• On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API…) – needs agent
	• AWS to AWS (different storage services) – no agent needed
• Can synchronize to:
	• Amazon S3 (any storage classes – including Glacier)
	• Amazon EFS
	• Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS...)
• Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
• File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB…)
• One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup a bandwidth limit

In order to move files directly into your Amazon VPC, DataSync supports VPC endpoints 
(powered by AWS PrivateLink).

When you use DataSync with S3, it supports storing data directly into any S3 storage class. 
You do not need to use lifecycle policies or manually transfer data from S3.

ExamTips:AWS DataSync copy data and metadata between AWS Storage Services



S3 to EFS then AWS Datasync is the service to go for Datasync, as AWS Storage Gateway doesn’t support 
transfer within cloud.

If you want to transfer on-premises block/tapes to AWS, then AWS Storage Gateway is the option to go with.

 When the requirement is to transfer files from on premises to AWS EFS (elastic file system) 
 then AWS Datasync is the option as AWS Storage Gateway doesn’t support EFS.


Datasync can also be used to move or sync data between AWS storage services like S3, 
EFS or FSx in the same or different accounts.


You can connect Datasync to NFS (Network File System) shares, SMB (Server Message Block) shares, 
Hadoop distributed file systems, self managed object storage, AWS Snowcone and move data to S3, 
Amazon elastic file systems, FSx for Windows file server and FSx for Lustre file systems.


++All Aws Storage Comparison
-------------------------------------------------
Storage Comparison:
• S3: Object Storage
• S3 Glacier: Object Archival
• EBS volumes: Network storage for one EC2 instance at a time
• Instance Storage: Physical storage for your EC2 instance (high IOPS)
• EFS: Network File System for Linux instances, POSIX filesystem
• FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
• FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
• FSx for NetApp ONTAP: High OS Compatibility
• FSx for OpenZFS: Managed ZFS file system
• Storage Gateway: S3 & FSx File Gateway, Volume Gateway (cache & stored), Tape Gateway
• Transfer Family: FTP, FTPS, SFTP interface on top of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
• DataSync: Schedule data sync from on-premises to AWS, or AWS to AWS
• Snowcone / Snowball / Snowmobile: to move large amount of data to the cloud, physically
• Database: for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying

##Decouple your applications:
-------------------------------------------------
There are two patterns of application communication:
	1) Synchronous communications (application-application)
	2) Asynchronous / Event based (application-queue-application)
	
• Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
• What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it’s 10?


In that case, it’s better to decouple your applications,
	• using SQS: queue model
	• using SNS: pub/sub model
	• using Kinesis: real-time streaming model
These services can scale independently from our application!

SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services, and they’re using proprietary protocols from AWS.
Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, 
Openwire, WSS



60
##SQS Queues
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and 
scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

You cannot set a priority to individual items in the SQS queue.

Attributes:
	• Unlimited throughput, unlimited number of messages in queue
	• Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
	• Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
	• Limitation of 256KB per message sent
• Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)
• Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)


Produced:
	• Produced to SQS using the SDK (SendMessage API)
	• The message is persisted in SQS until a consumer deletes it
	• Message retention: default 4 days, up to 14 days


Consuming:
Consumers receive and process messages in parallel
We can scale consumers horizontally to improve throughput of processing

	• Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or AWS Lambda)…
	• Poll SQS for messages (receive up to 10 messages at a time)
	• Process the messages (example: insert the message into an RDS database)
	• Delete the messages using the DeleteMessage API


Message Visibility Timeout:
	• After a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers
	• By default, the “message visibility timeout” is 30 seconds
	• That means the message has 30 seconds to be processed consumer need more time to process then consumer 
	  clud call ChangeMessageVisible API to  get more time.
	• After the message visibility timeout is over, the message is “visible” in SQS again for every consumer



Dead Letter Queue:
	• We can set a threshold of how many times a message can go back to the queue
	• After the MaximumReceives threshold is exceeded, the message goes into a dead letter queue (DLQ)
	• Useful for debugging!  Good to set a retention of 14 days in the DLQ



Delay Queue:
	• Delay a message (consumers don’t see it immediately) up to 15 minutes
	• Default is 0 seconds (message is available right away)
	• Can set a default at queue level
	• Can override the default on send using the DelaySeconds parameter



Long Polling:
	• When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally “wait” for messages to
	  arrive if there are none in the queue
	• This is called Long Polling
	• LongPolling decreases the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and
	  reducing latency of your application
	• The wait time can be between 1 sec to 20 sec (20 sec preferable)



SQS – Request-Response Systems:
• To implement this pattern: use the SQS Temporary Queue Client
• It leverages virtual queues instead of creating / deleting SQS queues (cost-effective)


FIFO Queue:
	• FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
	• Limited throughput: 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with batching
	• Exactly-once send capability (by removing duplicates)
	• Messages are processed in order by the consumer


You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue.
 
By default 300 Opration per second, if a 4 msg can process per operation then its will be 1200 Op per second !

By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second). 

When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), FIFO queues can support up to 
3,000 messages per second. Therefore you need to process 4 messages per operation so that the 
FIFO queue can support up to 1200 messages per second, which is well within the peak rate.

If you require higher throughput, you can enable high throughput mode for FIFO on the 
Amazon SQS console, which will support up to 30,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 
3,000 messages per second without batching.



Amazon SQS has automatically deleted the messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period.
Default message retention period is 4 days.


Amazon SQS uses short polling by default.
Short polling works for scenarios that require higher throughput. 
However, you can also configure the queue to use Long polling instead, to reduce cost.

The ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds is the queue attribute that determines whether you are using 
Short or Long polling. By default, its value is zero which means it is using Short polling. 
If it is set to a value greater than zero, then it is Long polling.

The visibility timeout is a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other 
consuming components from receiving and processing a message.
The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.
 
Amazon SQS doesn’t automatically delete the message

Area:
=====
SQS is a regional service, that is highly available within a single region. 
There is no cross-region replication capability.



UseCase:
========
SQS as a buffer to database writes
SQS to decouple between application tiers

Eliminate administrative overhead
Reliably deliver messages
Scale elastically and cost-effectively



BillCost:
=========
Amazon SQS Free Tier
Amazon SQS has no upfront costs. The first million monthly requests are free. 
After that, you pay based on the number and content of requests, and the interactions with 
Amazon S3 and the AWS Key Management Service.



Security:
=========
•Encryption:
	• In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
	• At-rest encryption using KMS keys
	• Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself
• Access Controls: IAM policies to regulate access to the SQS API
• SQS Access Policies (similar to S3 bucket policies)
	• Useful for cross-account access to SQS queues
	• Useful for allowing other services (SNS, S3…) to write to an SQS queue
As a managed service, Amazon SQS is protected by the AWS global network security.

61
##SNS (Simple Notification Service)
--------------------------------------------------
Anytime multiple services need to receive the same event, you should consider SNS rather than SQS.

SNS cannot directly send messages to Kinesis Data Streams.
You can use to deliver messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. 

You would need to write a Lambda function that would send the message to a Kinesis stream.
Lambda function will not "fetch from SNS". Rather, the Lambda function will be triggered by SNS, 
with the message being passed as input. 
Your Lambda function will then need to send the message to Kinesis.

It provides much more functionality than just the ability to send push notifications (emails, SMS, and mobile push). 
In fact, it’s a serverless publish-subscribe messaging system allowing to send events to multiple 
applications (subscribers) at the same time (fan-out), 
including SQS queues, Lambda functions, Kinesis Data Streams, and generic HTTP endpoints. 

In order to use the service, we only need to:
create a topic,
subscribe to a topic,
confirm the subscription,
start sending events to a topic to deliver them to all subscribers (potentially multiple applications and people).


The event producer only sends a message to one SNS topic at a time
Many event receivers can be created to listen to an SNS topic notification

• The “event producer” only sends message to one SNS topic
• As many “event receivers” (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
• Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filter messages)
• Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
• 100,000 topics limit


Many AWS services can send data directly to SNS for notifications:
	CloudWatch Alarms
	S3 Bucket (Events)
	Auto Scaling Group (Notifications)
	CloudFormation (State Changes)
	AWS Budgets Lambda
	AWS DMS (New Replic)
	DynamoDB
	RDS Events
	 

62
##SNS and SQS | FanOut Pattern
-------------------------------------------------
Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fanout messages to a 
large number of subscriber systems, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTPS endpoints, and 
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose,  for parallel processing. 
The A2P functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale via SMS, mobile push, and email.

Take note that you should use SNS instead of SES (Simple Email Service) when you want to monitor your EC2 instances.


Fan Out:
• Push once in SNS, receive in all SQS queues that are subscribers
• Fully decoupled, no data loss
• Make sure your SQS queue access policy allows for SNS to write

By default, an Amazon SNS topic subscriber receives every message published to the topic. 
You can use Amazon SNS message filtering to assign a filter policy to the topic subscription, 
and the subscriber will only receive a message that they are interested in. 



SNS – FIFO Topic:
	• FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the topic).
	• Ordering by Message Group ID (all messages in the same group are ordered).
	• Deduplication using a Deduplication ID or Content Based Deduplication.
	• Can only have SQS FIFO queues as subscribers.
	• Limited throughput (same throughput as SQS FIFO).
	
You can use Amazon SNS FIFO (first in, first out) topics and Amazon Simple Queue Service 
(Amazon SQS) FIFO queues together to provide strict message ordering and message deduplication.


Message Filtering:
	• JSON policy used to filter messages sent to SNS topic’s subscriptions
	• If a subscription doesn’t have a filter policy, it receives every message





Area:
=====
Regioinal.



UseCase:
========
Application integration
Application alerts
User notifications:Amazon SNS can send push email messages and text messages (SMS messages) to individuals or groups.
Mobile push notifications.

Simplify and reduce costs with message filtering and batching
Amazon SNS FIFO topics work with Amazon SQS FIFO queues to ensure messages are delivered in a strictly-ordered 
manner and are only processed once.
Increase security with message encryption and privacy.



BillCost:
=========
The Free Tier 
You pay based on the number of messages that you publish, the number of notifications that you 
deliver, and any additional API calls for managing topics and subscriptions. 
Delivery pricing varies by endpoint type.



Security:
=========

Amazon SNS provides encrypted topics to protect your messages from unauthorized access. 
The encryption uses a 256-bit AES-GCM algorithm and a customer master key (CMK) issued 
with AWS Key Management Service (KMS). 
Amazon SNS also supports VPC endpoints via AWS PrivateLink, so you can privately publish messages 
to Amazon SNS topics, from an 
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnet, without traversing the Internet.







63
##Kinesis
-------------------------------------------------
A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default to a maximum of 8760 hours (365 days).

Amazon Kinesis is the streaming data platform of AWS and has four distinct services under it: 
Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. 


Makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze streaming data in real-time and that can be run on EC2 instances.
Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless.
Ingest real-time data such as: Application logs, Metrics, Website clickstreams,IoT telemetry data.

• Kinesis Data Streams: capture, process, and store data streams
• Kinesis Data Firehose: load data streams into AWS data stores
• Kinesis Data Analytics: analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink
• Kinesis Video Streams: capture, process, and store video streams


The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real time. 
Consumers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2 or an Amazon 
Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) 
can store their results using an AWS service such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon S3.


Kinesis Data Streams:
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. 
By default, the 2MB/second/shard output is shared between all of the applications consuming data from the stream.
consumers to use enhanced fan-out and receive their own 2MB/second pipe of read throughput per shard.


Kinesis Data Streams cannot directly write the output to S3. 
Unlike Firehose, KDS does not offer a ready-made integration via an intermediary 
Lambda function to reliably dump data into S3. 

You will need to do a lot of custom coding to get the Lambda function to process the 
incoming stream and then store the transformed output to S3.

• Retention between 1 day to 365 days
• Ability to reprocess (replay) data,
  you can replay messages, or have multiple consumers that are subscribing to your Kinesis Stream.
• Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can’t be deleted (immutability)
• Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard (ordering)
	• Producers: AWS SDK, Kinesis Producer Library (KPL), Kinesis Agent
	• Consumers:
		• Write your own: Kinesis Client Library (KCL), AWS SDK
		• Managed: AWS Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics.


Provisioned mode:
	• You choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
	• Each shard gets 1MB/s in (or 1000 records per second)
	• Each shard gets 2MB/s out (classic or enhanced fan-out consumer)
	• You pay per shard provisioned per hour
On-demand mode:
	• No need to provision or manage the capacity
	• Default capacity provisioned (4 MB/s in or 4000 records per second)
	• Scales automatically based on observed throughput peak during the last 30 days
	• Pay per stream per hour & data in/out per GB



Kinesis Data Streams Security:
	• Control access/authorization using IAM policies
	• Encryption in-flight using HTTPS endpoints
	• Encryption at rest using KMS
	• You can implement encryption/decryption of data on client side (harder)
	• VPC Endpoints available for Kinesis to access within VPC
	• Monitor API calls using CloudTrail


Kinesis Data Firehose:
	 Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to reliably load streaming data into data lakes, 
	 data stores, and analytics tools, Not application.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose captures and loads data in near real time. It loads new data into Amazon S3, 
Amazon Redshift, and Amazon OpenSearch Service within 60 seconds after the data is sent to the service. 

Load streaming data into S3 / Redshift / ElasticSearch / 3rd party / custom HTTP.
	• Fully managed
	• Near real-time (buffer time min. 60 sec)
	• Automatic scaling
	• No data storage
	• Doesn’t support replay capability

Kinesis Data Firehose can only write to S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch or Splunk. 
You can't have applications consuming data streams from Kinesis Data Firehose, 
that's the job of Kinesis Data Streams (Write your own: Kinesis Client Library (KCL), AWS SDK).

Pay for data going through Firehose
Perform real-time analytics on Kinesis Streams using SQL
 
It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, 
minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security.


Kinesis Data Analytics (SQL application):
	• Perform real-time analytics on Kinesis Streams using SQL
	• Fully managed, no servers to provision
	• Automatic scaling
	• Real-time analytics
	• Pay for actual consumption rate
	• Can create streams out of the real-time queries
• Use cases:
	• Time-series analytics
	• Real-time dashboards
	• Real-time metrics
	
Kinesis Data Analytics cannot directly ingest data from the source, as it ingests data either from 
Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose.

The four most common use cases are streaming 
	extract-transform-load (ETL), 
	continuous metric generation, 
	responsive real-time analytics, and 
	interactive querying of data streams.


Ordering data into Kinesis:
• Imagine you have 100 trucks (truck_1, truck_2, … truck_100) on the road sending their GPS positions regularly into AWS.
• You want to consume the data in order for each truck, so that you can track their movement accurately.
• How should you send that data into Kinesis?
	• Answer: send using a “Partition Key” value of the “truck_id”
	• The same key will always go to the same shard.



Ordering data into SQS:
• For SQS standard, there is no ordering.
• For SQS FIFO, if you don’t use a Group ID, messages are consumed in the order they are sent, 
  with only one consumer
• You want to scale the number of consumers, but you want messages to be “grouped” when they 
  are related to each other.
• Then you use a Group ID (similar to Partition Key in Kinesis)



SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis:

SQS:
• Consumer “pull data”
• Data is deleted after being consumed
• Can have as many workers (consumers) as we want
• No need to provision throughput
• Ordering guarantees only on FIFO queues
• Individual message delay capability

As multiple applications are consuming the same stream concurrently, both SQS Standard and 
SQS FIFO are not the right.

Message Replayability:
Because consumers usually will delete the message once it processed, there is no message replayability in SQS.

At-least-once delivery guarantee:multiple attempts are made at delivering it.
In more casual terms this means that messages may be duplicated but not lost.



SNS:
• Push data to many subscribers
• Up to 12,500,000 subscribers
• Data is not persisted (lost if not delivered)
• Pub/Sub
• Up to 100,000 topics
• No need to provision throughput
• Integrates with SQS for fan- out architecture pattern
• FIFO capability for SQS FIFO



Kinesis:
	• Standard: pull data
	• 2 MB per shard
	• Enhanced-fan out: push data
	• 2 MB per shard per consumer
	• Possibility to replay data
	• Meant for real-time big data, analytics and ETL
	• Ordering at the shard level
	• Data expires after X days
	• Provisioned mode or on-demand capacity mode



However, the user is expected to manually provision an appropriate number of shards to 
process the expected volume of the incoming data stream. 
The throughput of an 
Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of 
shards within a data stream. 

Area:
=====
Regional.


UseCase:
========
Kinesis Video Streams

• Real-time dashboards
• Real-time metrics


BillCost:
=========
You pay only for the volume of data you ingest, store, and consume in your video streams.



Security:

It is a Fully-managed, serverless service.
Security is a shared responsibility.

##Amazon MQ
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate 
message brokers on AWS.

• SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services, and they’re using proprietary protocols from AWS.
• Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
• When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
• Amazon MQ = managed Apache ActiveMQ
• Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
• Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine, can run in HA with failover
• Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)

How do I migrate if I'm using a different message broker instead of ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ?
Amazon MQ provides compatibility with the most common messaging APIs, such as Java Message Service (JMS) and 
.NET Message Service (NMS), and protocols, including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. 

This makes it easy to switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code 
in your applications. 
In most cases, you can simply update the endpoints of your Amazon MQ broker to connect to your existing applications, 
and start sending messages.



A cluster deployment is a logical grouping of three RabbitMQ broker nodes behind a Network Load Balancer, 
each sharing users, queues, and a distributed state across multiple Availability Zones (AZ). 
In a cluster deployment, Amazon MQ automatically manages broker policies to enable classic mirroring across all nodes, 
ensuring high availability (HA).


Area:
=====
Regional.



UseCase:
========
Migration MQ service to AWS.


BillCost:
=========
Amazon MQ is free to try.
You pay for the time your message broker instance runs, the storage you use monthly, and standard data transfer fees**

Broker Pricing Hourly instance usage
Broker Storage Pricing Monthly storage usag


Security:
=========
It is a Fully-managed, serverless service.
Security is a shared responsibility.





==| Container Section

##ECS
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy for you to 
deploy, manage, and  scale containerized applications.

Launch Docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters


You can’t directly set CloudWatch Alarms to update the ECS task count.


Amazon ECS lets you run batch workloads with managed or custom schedulers on  
EC2 On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, or Spot Instances.

You can launch Reserved EC2 instances to process the mission-critical data and 
Spot EC2 instances for processing non-essential batch jobs.

There are two different charge models for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): 
Fargate Launch Type Model and EC2 Launch Type Model. 
	With Fargate, you pay for the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application requests.
	EC2 launch type model, there is no additional charge. 
	You pay for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances or EBS volumes) you create to store and run your application. 
	You only pay for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.


	EC2 Launch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
		• Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
		• AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers

	Fargate launch type: This is a serverless pay-as-you-go option. 
	     You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage)
		• It’s all Serverless!
		• You just create task definitions
		• AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need
		• To scale, just increase the number of tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances



The EC2 launch type is suitable:
	Workloads that require consistently high CPU core and memory usage
	Large workloads that need to be optimized for price
	Your applications need to access persistent storage
	You must directly manage your infrastructure
	
	
The Fargate suitable:
	Large workloads that need to be optimized for low overhead
	Small workloads that have occasional burst
	Tiny workloads
	Batch workloads


TaskDefinition:
	TaskDefinition resource describes the container and volume definitions of an  ECS task. You can specify which Docker images to use, 
	the required resources, and other configurations related to launching the task 
	definition through an Amazon ECS service or task.
You can define multiple containers in a task definition.



AWS Fargate is a serverless option.
	-Service: Allows you to run and maintain a specified number (the “desired count”) of tasks
	-ECS cluster: Grouping of one or more container instances (EC2 instances) where you run your tasks
	-Container Instance - EC2 instance in the cluster running a container agent 
	 (helps it communicate with the cluster)
	-AWS provides ECS ready AMIs with container agents pre-installed.


Remember:
-AWS Fargate does NOT give you visibility into the EC2 instances in the cluster.
-You can use On-Demand instances or Spot instances to create your cluster.
-You can load balance using Application Load Balancers

Two features of ALB are important for ECS:
	-Dynamic host port mapping: Multiple tasks from the same service are allowed per EC2 (container) instance
	-Path-based routing: Multiple services can use the same listener port on same ALB/NLB and be routed based 
	 on path (www.app.com/microservice-a and www.app.com/microservice-b)




Elastic Beanstalk:
Single container or multiple containers in same EC2 instance
Recommended for simple web applications


Amazon Fargate:
Serverless version of Amazon ECS
You want to run microservices and you don’t want to manage the cluster


Amazon EKS:
AWS managed service for Kubernetes
Recommended if you are already using Kubernetes and would want to move the workload to AWS


Amazon ECS – Load Balancer Integrations:
	• Application Load Balancer supported and works for most use cases
	• Network Load Balancer recommended only for high throughput / high performance use cases, 
	  or to pair it with AWS Private Link.
	• Elastic Load Balancer supported but not recommended (no advanced features – no Fargate)

ECS Service Auto Scaling
• Automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
  ECS Service Auto Scaling (task level) ≠ EC2 Auto Scaling (EC2 instance level)

• Target Tracking – scale based on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric
• Step Scaling – scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm
• Scheduled Scaling – scale based on a specified date/time (predictable changes)



ECS Rolling Updates:
• When updating from v1 to v2, we can control how many tasks can be started and stopped, and in which order.


Amazon ECS – IAM Roles for ECS:
	• EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only):
		• Used by the ECS agent
		• Makes API calls to ECS service
		• Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
		• Pull Docker image from ECR
		• Reference sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
	• ECS Task Role:
		• Allows each task to have a specific role
		• Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
		• Task Role is defined in the task definition


***
ECS Task Role is the IAM Role used by the ECS task itself. 
Use when your container wants to call other AWS services like S3, SQS, etc.


***
Amazon ECS – Data Volumes (EFS):
	• Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
	• Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
	• Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file system
	• Fargate + EFS = Serverless
	• Use cases: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
	• Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system


ECS tasks can invoked by EventBridge.
ECS tasks can invoked by EventBridge Schedule.
ECS task can invoke by  SQS Queue 

Fargate task storage: 
When provisioned, each Amazon ECS task that are hosted on AWS Fargate receives the following 
ephemeral storage for bind mounts. This can be mounted and shared among containers that use 
the volumes, mountPoints, and volumesFrom parameters in the task definition.

The ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm, which uses an AWS owned encryption key.


By default, Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.0.0 or 
later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage.


Fargate tasks using Linux platform version 1.3.0 or earlier
10 GB of Docker layer storage
An additional 4 GB for volume mounts. This can be mounted and shared among containers using the volumes, mountPoints, 
and volumesFrom parameters in the task definition.



Fargate tasks using Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later
By default, Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 
or later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage. The total amount of 
ephemeral storage can be increased, up to a maximum of 200 GiB.


20 GB of ephemeral storage is available for all Fargate Tasks and Pods by default—you only pay for any additional storage 
that you configure.




Area:
=====
Amazon ECS is a regional service that simplifies running containers in a highly available manner across 
multiple Availability Zones within a Region



UseCase:
========
Deploy in a hybrid environment: Build container-based applications on-premises or in the cloud with 


BillCost:
=========
Fargate is not on the free tier list. 
Amazon ECS is always free. 
You pay for AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and memory) you 
create to store and run your application.

Amazon ECS pricing is dependent on whether you use AWS Fargate or Amazon EC2 infrastructure to host your 
containerized workloads.



Security:
=========
We can add security group for ECS and ECS Task.

Your EC2 instances use an IAM role to access the ECS/ECR service.
ECS Task Role use to access services and resources.
Security Groups and networks ACLs allow you to control inbound and outbound network access to and 
from your instances.

##EKS
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon EKS is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications. 
These services include Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution, IAM for authentication, 
Amazon VPC for isolation, and AWS CloudTrail for logging.


Amazon EKS = Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (cloud-agnostic and open-source platforms = EKS)
• It is a way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
• Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of 
  containerized (usually Docker) application
• It’s an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
• EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes, or Fargate to deploy serverless containers
• Use case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants 
  to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes.
• Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud – Azure, GCP…)
• For multiple regions, deploy one EKS cluster per region
• Collect logs and metrics using CloudWatch Container Insights

67
##Lambda
-------------------------------------------------
You can invoke an AWS Lambda function from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster with a native function or a stored procedure.


AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of 
application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. 

The default timeout is 3 seconds, and the maximum execution duration per request in 
AWS Lambda is 900 seconds, which is equivalent to 15 minutes.

By default, the AWS Lambda limits the total 
concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 1000.

You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, 
and only pay for what you use.

Lambda allows you to add custom logic to AWS resources such as Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon DynamoDB tables.

AWS Lambda Limits to Know - per region:
Execution:
	• Memory allocation: 128 MB – 10GB (1 MB increments)
	• Maximum execution time: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
	• Environment variables (4 KB)
	• Disk capacity in the “function container” (in /tmp): 512 MB
	• Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)
Deployment:
	• Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
	• Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
	• Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup
	• Size of environment variables: 4 KB

Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC.
You should only enable your functions for VPC access when you need to interact with a private resource 
located in a private subnet. 
An RDS instance is a good example.


Once your function is VPC-enabled, all network traffic from your function is subject 
to the routing rules of your VPC/Subnet.
 
If your function needs to interact with a public 
resource, you will need a route through a NAT gateway in a public subnet.


Replace the Kinesis Data Streams with an Amazon SQS queue. 
Create a Lambda function that will asynchronously process the requests.

AWS Lambda function use to process messages in  SQS queue. 
Lambda event source mappings support standard queues and first-in, first-out (FIFO) queues.

Kinesis Data Streams is a real-time data streaming service that requires the provisioning of shards. 
Amazon SQS is a cheaper option because you only pay for what you use. 
Since there is no requirement for real-time processing in the scenario given, replacing 
Kinesis Data Streams with Amazon SQS would save more costs.


For Error like EC2ThrottledException:
Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. 
If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure that your VPC has sufficient 
ENI capacity to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function.

##Labmbda@Edge | Lambda@Edge 
-------------------------------------------------
Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, 
which improves performance and reduces latency.


With Lambda@Edge, you can enrich your web applications by making them globally distributed and 
improving their performance — all with zero server administration. 

Lambda@Edge runs your code in response to events generated by the CloudFront.
Just upload your code to AWS Lambda, which takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high 
availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.


	After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)
	Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin (origin request)
	After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)
	Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)

Lambda are regional service. 
Lambda@Edge is a global service. 

Lambda@Edge allows you to execute the logic across multiple location (Node.js and Paython only)

You can use Lambda@Edge to change CloudFront requests and responses.
You can also generate responses to viewers without ever sending the request to the origin.


Customize the content that the CloudFront  delivers to your users using Lambda@Edge, 
which allows your Lambda functions to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users.


User getting HTTP 504 errors:
Set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins. 
Specify one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which 
CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific 
HTTP status code failure responses.



By using Lambda@Edge and Kinesis together, you can process real-time streaming data 
so that you can track and analyze globally-distributed user activity on your website and 
mobile applications, including clickstream analysis.

UseCase:
A/B Testing
Real-time Image Transformation
User Authentication and Authorization
Intelligently Route Across Origins and Data Centers
User Prioritization
User Tracking and Analytics


By using Lambda@Edge to dynamically route requests to different origins based on different viewer characteristics, 
you can balance the load on your origins, while improving the performance for your users. 
For example, you can route requests to origins within a home region, based on a viewer's location.



Area:
=====
Lambda@Edge is a global service.



UseCase:
========
• Website Security and Privacy 
• Dynamic Web Application at the Edge 
• Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 
• Intelligently Route Across Origins and Data Centers 
• Bot Mitigation at the Edge 
• Real-time Image Transformation 
• A/B Testing 
• User Authentication and Authorization 
• User Prioritization 
• User Tracking and Analytics



BillCost:
=========
You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.



Security:
=========
It is a Fully-managed, serverless service.
Security is a shared responsibility.




++Lambda in VPC
-------------------------------------------------
• By default, your Lambda function is launched outside your own VPC (in an AWS -owned VPC)
• Therefore, it cannot access resources in your VPC (RDS, ElastiCache,internal ELB…)

• You must define the VPC ID, the Subnets and the Security Groups
• Lambda will create an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in your subnets



++Lambda with RDS Proxy 
-------------------------------------------------
• If Lambda functions directly access your database, they may open too many connections under high load
• RDS Proxy:
	• Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
	• Improve availability by reducing by 66% the failover time and preserving connections
	• Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication and storing credentials in Secrets Manager
• The Lambda function must be deployed in your VPC, because RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible





69
##DynamoDB
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance 
applications at any scale and single-digit millisecond performance.
DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, 
and data import and export tools.

In DynamoDB, you can only find by primary key or indexes.

A key-value store holds for each key a single value. Arguably, if the value can be an entire document, 
you can call this database a "document store". In this sense, DynamoDB is a document store.


The main components of DynamoDB are:
• DynamoDB is made of Tables
• Each table has a Primary Key (must be decided at creation time)
• Each table can have an infinite number of items (= rows)
• Each item has attributes (can be added over time – can be null)
• Maximum size of an item is 400KB
-Data types supported are:
	• Scalar Types – String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
	• Document Types – List, Map
	• Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set

DynamoDB is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, 
making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.


DynamoDB – Read/Write Capacity Modes:
• Control how you manage your table’s capacity (read/write throughput)
Provisioned Mode (default)
	• You specify the number of reads/writes per second
	• You need to plan capacity beforehand
	• Pay for provisioned Read Capacity Units (RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCU)
	• Possibility to add auto-scaling mode for RCU & WCU
On-Demand Mode
	• Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
	• No capacity planning needed
	• Pay for what you use, more expensive ($$$)
	• Great for unpredictable workloads


Time To Live (TTL):
• Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp
• Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations.



DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX):
	• Fully-managed, highly available, seamless in-memory cache for DynamoDB
	• Help solve read congestion by caching
	• Microseconds latency for cached data
	• Doesn’t require application logic modification(compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs)
	• 5 minutes TTL for cache (default)

DAX fetches the key-value pair from DynamoDB.
The key-value pair then returns the value back to the application.

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) delivers fast response times for accessing eventually consistent data. 
Certain usecases requires microseconds response times.

DAX:
You can't invalidate cache, it only invalidates when ttl is 
reached or nodes memory is full and it is dropping old items.

ElastiCache is not intended for use with DynamoDB.

ElastiCache (available as a managed service) can cache the results from anything. 
The difference here is that you need to manage invalidation and you must adjust your code to 
check the cache before querying the main query store.

Most fo the time, you’ll want to go DAX if you’re using DyanmoDB as a data store. 
Otherwise, use ElastiCache.



What are DynamoDB streams?
	A DynamoDB Stream is a time-ordered sequence of events recording all the modifications for 
	DynamoDB tables in near real-time. Similar to change data capture, DynamoDB Streams consist 
	of multiple Insert, Update, and Delete events. Each record has a unique sequence number 
	which is used for ordering. 
https://www.macrometa.com/event-stream-processing/dynamodb-streams

DymanoDB Stream:
	DymanoDB Stream is kind of event to interact with other servies like:lambda,s3,sns etc to doing some thing.
	as: User complated their registration and with DymanoDB Stream we cand send a welcome email using Lambda and SNS.
	For Global table Multi Region replication Need to enable DymanoDB Stream.


DynamoDB Streams:
	• 24 hours retention
	• Limited # of consumers
	• Process using AWS Lambda Triggers, or DynamoDB Stream Kinesis adapter

Kinesis Data Streams (newer):
	• 1 year retention
	• High # of consumers
	• Process using AWS Lambda, Kinesis DataAnalytics, Kineis Data Firehose, AWS GlueStreaming ETL… 


DynamoDB – Backups for disaster recovery:
• Continuous backups using point-in-time recovery (PITR)
	• Optionally enabled for the last 35 days
	• Point-in-time recovery to any time within the backup window
	• The recovery process creates a new table
• On-demand backups
	• Full backups for long-term retention, until explicitely deleted
	• Doesn’t affect performance or latency
	• Can be configured and managed in AWS Backup (enables cross-region copy)
	• The recovery process creates a new table



DynamoDB – Integration with Amazon S3:
	• Export to S3 (must enable PITR)
		• Works for any point of time in the last 35 days
		• Doesn’t affect the read capacity of your table
		• Perform data analysis on top of DynamoDB
		• Retain snapshots for auditing
		• ETL on top of S3 data before importing back into DynamoDB
		• Export in DynamoDB JSON or ION format
	• Import to S3:
		• Import CSV, DynamoDB JSON or ION format
		• Doesn’t consume any write capacity
		• Creates a new table
		• Import errors are logged in CloudWatch Logs


DynamoDB Global Tables:(two-way-replication)
	• Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
	• Active-Active replication
	• Applications can READ and WRITE to the table in any region
	• Must enable DynamoDB Streams as a pre-requisite



Enable DynamoDB Stream and create an AWS Lambda trigger, as well as the IAM role which contains 
all of the permissions that the Lambda function will need at runtime. The data from the stream 
record will be processed by the Lambda function which will then publish a message to SNS Topic 
that will notify the subscribers via email.

Also working with Kinesis Client Library (KCL).


Mobile game that has a serverless backend:
– Enable DAX and ensure that the Auto Scaling is enabled and increase the maximum provisioned read and write capacity.
– Use API Gateway in conjunction with Lambda and turn on the caching on frequently accessed data and enable DynamoDB global replication.

Since Auto Scaling is enabled by default, the provisioned read and write capacity will adjust automatically. 
Also enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to improve the performance 
from milliseconds to microseconds is incorrect because by default, 
Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.



Integrate DynamoDB table with CloudFront as these two are incompatible.


SimpleDB is incorrect. Although SimpleDB is also a highly available and scalable NoSQL database, 
it has a limit on the request capacity or storage size for a given table, unlike DynamoDB.

DynamoDB is durable, scalable, and highly available data store which can be used for 
real-time tabulation. 
You can also use AppSync with DynamoDB to make it easy for you to build collaborative apps that 
keep shared data updated in real-time.


Improve the database performance:
Use partition keys with high-cardinality attributes, which have a large number of distinct values for each item.


Avoid using a composite primary key, which is composed of a partition key and a sort key is 
incorrect because as mentioned, a composite primary key will provide more partition for the table 
and in turn, improves the performance. 
Hence, it should be used and not avoided.

Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) feature is not capable of restoring a DynamoDB table to a particular 
point in time in a different AWS account.

DynamoDB on-demand backups are available at no additional cost beyond the normal pricing that’s associated with backup storage size. 
DynamoDB on-demand backups cannot be copied to a different account or Region. 
To create backup copies across AWS accounts and Regions and for other advanced features, you should use AWS Backup.

=====
Regional.



UseCase:
========
Develop software applications
Scale gaming platforms



BillCost:
=========
DynamoDB charges for reading, writing, and storing data in your DynamoDB tables, along with any optional 
features you choose to enable.

DynamoDB has two capacity modes,:
Pricing for on-demand capacity mode

On-demand capacity mode might be best if you:
Create new tables with unknown workloads
Have unpredictable application traffic
Prefer the ease of paying for only what you use

Provisioned capacity mode might be best if you:
Have predictable application traffic
Run applications whose traffic is consistent or ramps gradually
Can forecast capacity requirements to control costs



Security:
=========
Security is a shared responsibility.
DynamoDB encrypts data at rest by default and also in transit using the keys stored in 
AWS Key Management Service (or customer-provided keys).
DynamoDB also provides access control via AWS IAM roles.

##API Gateway
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to 
create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

You can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.

API Types;
RESTful:   Build RESTful APIs optimized for serverless workloads and HTTP backends using HTTP APIs.
WebSocket: Build real-time two-way communication applications, such as chat apps and streaming dashboards, 
with WebSocket APIs.


Features:
	-Integrates with AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS or any web application
	-Supports HTTP(S) and WebSockets (two way communication - chat apps and streaming dashboards)
	-Serverless. Pay for use (API calls and connection duration)
	-Provides API Lifecycle Management for RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs
	-You can Run multiple versions of the same API
	-Supports Rate Limits(request quota limits), throttling and fine-grained access permissions 
	 using API Keys for Third-Party Developers
	-Lifecycle management for REST APIs
	-Versioning and multiple environments
	-API keys - Generate API keys to monitor usage
	-Implement plans and quota limits for external applications (or developer)
	-WARNING - Do NOT use API keys for Authorization
	-Enable caching for API calls with TTL
	-Protect backends by throttling requests
	-Integrates with
	-Amazon CloudWatch - Performance metrics, API calls, latency data and error rates
	-Amazon CloudWatch Logs - Debug logging
	-AWS CloudTrail - Complete history of changes to your REST API



Endpoint Types:
	Edge-Optimized (default): For global clients
		• Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency)
		• The API Gateway still lives in only one region
	Regional:
		• For clients within the same region
		• Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strategies and the distribution)
	Private:
		• Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
		• Use a resource policy to define access



API Gateway – Security – Summary:
IAM:
	• Great for users / roles already within your AWS account
	• Handle authentication + authorization
	• Leverages Sig v4
Custom Authorizer:
	• Great for 3rd party tokens
	• Very flexible in terms of what IAM policy is returned
	• Handle Authentication + Authorization
	• Pay per Lambda invocation
Cognito User Pool:
	• You manage your own user pool (can be backed by Facebook, Google login etc…)
	• No need to write any custom code
	• Only authentication, must implement authorization in the backend



API Gateway – Security:
	• User Authentication through
	• IAM Roles (useful for internal applications)
	• Cognito (identity for external users – example mobile users)
	• Custom Authorizer (your own logic)
• Custom Domain Name HTTPS security through integration with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
	• If using Edge-Optimized endpoint, then the certificate must be in us-east-1
	• If using Regional endpoint, the certificate must be in the API Gateway region
	• Must setup CNAME or A-alias record in Route 53


Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis:
To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, Amazon API Gateway 
throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request. 
Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions 
against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size.


Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
Amazon API Gateway provides throttling at multiple levels including global and by service call. 
Throttling limits can be set for standard rates and bursts. 

You can add caching to API calls by provisioning an Amazon API Gateway cache and specifying its 
size in gigabytes. The cache is provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs. 
This improves performance and reduces the traffic sent to your back end. 

Cache settings allow you to control the way the cache key is built and the time-to-live (TTL) 
of the data stored for each method. 
Amazon API Gateway also exposes management APIs that help you invalidate the cache for each stage.

UseCase:
========
Efficient API development
Performance at any scale
Flexible security controls
Cost savings at scale



BillCost:
=========
The API Gateway free tier includes.
You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.



Security:
=========
Authorize access to your APIs with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Cognito. 
If you use OAuth tokens, API Gateway offers native OIDC and OAuth2 support. 
To support custom authorization requirements, you can execute a Lambda authorizer from AWS Lambda.

==|Serverless Architectures
72
##Serverless Architectures
-------------------------------------------------
MyTodoList:
• We want to create a mobile application with the following requirements
• Expose as REST API with HTTPS
• Serverless architecture
• Users should be able to directly interact with their own folder in S3
• Users should authenticate through a managed serverless service
• The users can write and read to-dos, but they mostly read them
• The database should scale, and have some high read throughput

Ans:
• Serverless REST API: HTTPS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB
• Using Cognito to generate temporary credentials with STS to access S3 bucket with restricted policy. 
  App users can directly access AWS resources this way. Pattern can be applied to DynamoDB, Lambda…
• Caching the reads on DynamoDB using DAX
• Caching the REST requests at the API Gateway level
• Security for authentication and authorization with Cognito, STS




MyBlog.com:
• This website should scale globally
• Blogs are rarely written, but often read
• Some of the website is purely static files, the rest is a dynamic REST API
• Caching must be implement where possible
• Any new users that subscribes should receive a welcome email
• Any photo uploaded to the blog should have a thumbnail generated

Ans:
• We’ve seen static content being distributed using CloudFront with S3
• The REST API was serverless, didn’t need Cognito because public
• We leveraged a Global DynamoDB table to serve the data globally
• (we could have used Aurora Global Database)
• We enabled DynamoDB streams to trigger a Lambda function
• The lambda function had an IAM role which could use SES
• SES (Simple Email Service) was used to send emails in a serverless way
• S3 can trigger SQS / SNS / Lambda to notify of events

##AWS MicroServices Architecture | Micro Services
-------------------------------------------------
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development created to 
speed up deployment cycles, foster innovation and ownership, improve maintainability and scalability of 
software applications.



• You are free to design each micro-service the way you want
• Synchronous patterns: API Gateway, Load Balancers
• Asynchronous patterns: SQS, Kinesis, SNS, Lambda triggers (S3)
• Challenges with micro-services:
	• repeated overhead for creating each new microservice,
	• issues with optimizing server density/utilization
	• complexity of running multiple versions of multiple microservices simultaneously
	• proliferation of client-side code requirements to integrate with many separate services.
• Some of the challenges are solved by Serverless patterns:
	• API Gateway, Lambda scale automatically and you pay per usage
	• You can easily clone API, reproduce environments
	• Generated client SDK through Swagger integration for the API Gateway



73
##Software updates offloading
-------------------------------------------------
• We have an application running on EC2, that distributes software updates once in a while
• When a new software update is out, we get a lot of request and the content is distributed in mass over the network. 
  It’s very costly
• We don’t want to change our application, but want to optimize our cost and CPU, how can we do it?

Ans:CloudFront
	• No changes to architecture
	• Will cache software update files at the edge
	• Software update files are not dynamic, they’re static (never changing)
	• Our EC2 instances aren’t serverless
	• But CloudFront is, and will scale for us
	• Our ASG will not scale as much, and we’ll save tremendously in EC2
	• We’ll also save in availability, network bandwidth cost, etc
	• Easy way to make an existing application more scalable and cheaper!

==|Databases
76
##Databases in AWS
-------------------------------------------------
Choosing the right database based on your architecture:
	• Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced workload? Throughput needs? Will it
	  change, does it need to scale or fluctuate during the day?
	• How much data to store and for how long? Will it grow? Average object size?
	  How are they accessed?
	• Data durability? Source of truth for the data ?
	• Latency requirements? Concurrent users?
	• Data model? How will you query the data? Joins? Structured? Semi-Structured?
	• Strong schema? More flexibility? Reporting? Search? RDBMS / NoSQL?
	• License costs? Switch to Cloud Native DB such as Aurora?


Database Types:

==|Data & Analytics
##Athena
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data 
directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
Athena is not a database but rather a query engine.

Athena cannot be used to build a REST API to consume data from the source, 
No APIGatwaay support to create rest api.

• Fully Serverless database with SQL capabilities
• Used to query data in S3
• Pay per query
• Output results back to S3
• Secured through IAM
• Use Case: one time SQL queries, serverless queries on S3, log analytics


Athena for Solutions Architect:
• Operations: no operations needed, serverless

ExamTip: analyze data in S3 using serverless SQL, use Athena


Area:
=====
Global.
Athena supports the ability to query Amazon S3 data in an AWS Region that is different from the Region in 
which you are using Athena.


UseCase:
========
Use cases: Business intelligence / analytics / reporting, analyze &
query VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrail trails.

Athena helps you analyze unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data stored in Amazon S3. 
Examples include CSV, JSON, or columnar data formats such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. 
You can use Athena to run ad-hoc queries using ANSI SQL, without the need to aggregate or load the data into Athena.


BillCost:
=========
You are charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query.
Pricing: $5.00 per TB of data scanned




Security:
=========
Security is a shared responsibility.

##Redshift ( Data Warehouse)
-------------------------------------------------
Fastest, easiest, and most widely used cloud data warehouse.

Redshift cluster as their data warehouse region outage:
	Enable Cross-Region Snapshots Copy in your Amazon Redshift Cluster.


Redshift data-warehouse is a collection of computing resources known as nodes, and these nodes are organized in a 
group known as a cluster. 
Each cluster runs in a Redshift Engine which contains one or more databases.

When you launch a Redshift instance, it starts with a single node of size 160 GB. When you want to grow, 
you can add additional nodes to take advantage of parallel processing. You have a leader node that manages 
the multiple nodes. Leader node handles the client connection as well as compute nodes. It stores the data 
in compute nodes and performs the query.


Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service in the cloud. Its datasets range from 
100s of gigabytes to a petabyte. 

What are the differences between a database and a data warehouse? 
A database is any collection of data organized for storage, accessibility, and retrieval. 

A data warehouse is a type of database the integrates copies of transaction data 
from disparate source systems and provisions them for analytical use.


Redshift for Solutions Architect:
	• Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but it’s not used for OLTP
	• It’s OLAP – online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
	• 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
	• Columnar storage of data (instead of row based) & parallel query engine
	• Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
	• Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
	• BI tools such as Amazon QuickSight or Tableau integrate with it
	• vs Athena: faster queries / joins / aggregations thanks to indexes

Remember: Redshift = Analytics / BI / Data Warehouse



Redshift – Snapshots & DR:
	• Redshift has no “Multi-AZ” mode
	• Snapshots are point-in-time backups of a cluster, stored internally in S3
	• Snapshots are incremental (only what has changed is saved)
	• You can restore a snapshot into a new cluster
	• Automated: every 8 hours, every 5 GB, or on a schedule. Set retention between 1 to 35 days
	• Manual: snapshot is retained until you delete it
	• You can configure Amazon Redshift to automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) 
	  of a cluster to another AWS Region



Loading data into Redshift: Large inserts are MUCH better
	Amazon Kinesis -> Kinesis Firehose->Redshift
	S3 using -> COPY command ->Redshift
	EC2 Instance -> JDBC driver ->Redshift





Redshift Spectrum:
With Redshift Spectrum, an analyst can perform SQL queries on data stored in Amazon S3 buckets. 
This can save time and money because it eliminates the need to move data from a storage service 
to a database, and instead directly queries data inside an S3 bucket. 

Redshift Spectrum also expands the scope of a given query because it 
extends beyond a user's existing Redshift data 
warehouse nodes and into large volumes of unstructured S3 data lakes.


• Query(SQL) data that is already in S3 without loading it
• Must have a Redshift cluster available to start the query
• The query is then submitted to thousands of Redshift Spectrum nodes

***
Today, there are three primary ways to access and analyze data in S3:
	Elastic MapReduce (EMR): EMR uses Hadoop-style queries to access and process large data sets in S3.
	Athena: Athena offers a console to query S3 data with standard SQL and no infrastructure to manage. 
	Athena also has an API.
	Redshift: You can load data from S3 into an Amazon Redshift cluster for analysis.
	
Redshift Spectrum is a logical extension of Redshift to query the data from Redshift as well as 
Amazon S3 data lakes whereas Athena is an exclusive tool to query data from Amazon S3 only.

If you already RedShift then go for ReadshiftSpectrum other wose Amazon Athena.

Athena and Redshift Spectrum provide compelling, cost-effective solutions to 
query the contents of your Datalake.

You cannot use Redshift to capture data in key-value pairs from the IoT sources.

Area:
=====
Redshift is not multi-AZ, if you want multi-AZ you will need to spin up a separate cluster 
ingesting the same input. 
You can also manually restore snapshots to a new AZ in the event of an outage.


UseCase:
========
Improve financial and demand forecasts
Collaborate and share data
Increase developer productivity



BillCost:
=========
AWS Free Tier
Customers can use the Redshift for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments or upfront costs and scale to a petabyte 
or more for $1,000 per terabyte per year.



Security:
=========
With a couple of parameter settings, you can set the Redshift to use SSL to secure your data. 
You can also enable encryption, all the data written to disk will be encrypted.

##OpenSearch Service|ElasticSearch now OpenSearch
-------------------------------------------------

Amazon OpenSearch Service makes it easy for you to perform interactive log analytics, 
real-time application monitoring,  website search, and more. 
OpenSearch is an open source, distributed search and analytics suite derived from Elasticsearch.

Amazon OpenSearch is successor to Amazon ElasticSearch (For licence issue ElasticSearch now Open search)
	• Example: In DynamoDB, you can only find by primary key or indexes
	• With OpenSearch, you can search any field, even partially matches
	• It’s common to use OpenSearch as a complement to another database
	• OpenSearch also has some usage for Big Data applications
	• You can provision a cluster of instances
	• Built-in integrations: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS IoT, and Amazon
	• In DynamoDB, queries only exist by primary key or indexes…
	• OpenSearch requires a cluster of instances (not serverless)
	• Does not support SQL (it has its own query language)

CloudWatch Logs for data ingestion


OpenSearch for Solutions Architect:
	• Operations: similar to RDS
	• Security: Cognito, IAM, VPC, KMS, SSL
	• Reliability: Multi-AZ, clustering
	• Performance: based on ElasticSearch project (open source), petabyte scale
	• Cost: pay per node provisioned (similar to RDS)
	• Remember: OpenSearch = Search / Indexing


CloudSearch:
	ElasticSearch and CloudSearch are Amazon’s cloud-based solutions for search. 
	ElasticSearch is an open source solution, whereas CloudSearch is a fully managed search service. 
	It is quite simple to set up, easy to, and a cost-effective search solution. 
	
	Amazon CloudSearch is an AWS Cloud managed service that helps users to create fast, scalable, 
	profitable, easy to setup search solutions for their applications. Amazon CloudSearch uses 
	Apache Solr as the underlying text search engine, which supports full-text search, 
	faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, 
	NoSQL features, and productive document handling.

OpenSearch and CloudSearch can be categorized as "Search as a Service" tools.

ElasticSearch Data and Index backup manual.
Cloudsearch automatically takes backup of the data. Unlike Elasticsearch.

Amazon Elasticsearch offers a licensed plugin called Shield. It handles the authorization, 
user authentication and permission allocation.
Cloudsearch offers an IAM-based access control mechanism.

There is no up-front licensing cost of Elasticsearch. Therefore, users do not need to 
pay any additional costs for licensing. 
Cloudsearch charges on an hourly basis, which depends on the size of user searches. 

Area:
=====
Regional.
Elasticsearch is not a multi-region service .


UseCase:
========
Monitor and debug applications and infrastructure
Manage security and event information (SIEM)



BillCost:
=========
Amazon OpenSearch Service with AWS Free Tier.

You are charged based on three dimensions: instance hours, which are the number of hours an instance is available to you 
for use;  the amount of storage you need; and data transferred in and out of Amazon OpenSearch Service. 
Storage pricing depends on the  storge tier and type of instance you choose.


Security:
=========
Security through Cognito & IAM, KMS encryption, SSL & VPC
Comes with OpenSearch Dashboards (visualization)



Kinesis Data Analytics (SQL application)
-------------------------------------------------
• Real-time analytics on Kinesis Data Streams & Firehose using SQL
• Add reference data from Amazon S3 to enrich streaming data
• Fully managed, no servers to provision

Output:
• Kinesis Data Streams: create streams out of the real-time analytics queries
• Kinesis Data Firehose: send analytics query results to destinations

• Use Flink (Java, Scala or SQL) to process and analyze streaming data



79
##EMR Elastic MapReduce
-------------------------------------------------
 Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data 
 using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, 
 Apache Hudi, and Presto. 
 Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute 
 your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. 
 
• EMR stands for “Elastic MapReduce”
• EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data
• The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
• EMR comes bundled with Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink…
• EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration
• Auto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances
• Use cases: Data processing, machine learning, web indexing, Big data.



Amazon EMR – Node types & purchasing:
• Master Node: Manage the cluster, coordinate, manage health – long running
• Core Node: Run tasks and store data – long running
• Task Node (optional): Just to run tasks – usually Spot
• Purchasing options:
	• On-demand: reliable, predictable, won’t be terminated
	• Reserved (min 1 year): cost savings (EMR will automatically use if available)
	• Spot Instances: cheaper, can be terminated, less reliable
• Can have long-running cluster, or transient (temporary) cluster


EMR does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre.


Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts 
of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, 
Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto.
 
Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, 
to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. 

Using an EMR cluster would imply managing the underlying infrastructure so it’s ruled out 
because the correct solution for the given use-case should require the least amount of 
infrastructure maintenance.

Athena		 ->Serverless sql analytic services.
ReadShift 	 ->Redshift is a managed petabyte-scale data warehouse that is accessed via SQL. 
EMR          ->Open Serach service with full text search services, No SQL.


If you want to use SQL and you have structured data (eg CSV files), then Redshift is the simplest solution.
If you want to process unstructured data (eg in strange formats rather than structured CSV files), 
Amazon EMR can provide a Hadoop system that is very capable.




80
++QuickSight (ML dashboards)
-------------------------------------------------
• Serverless machine learning-powered business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards
• Fast, automatically scalable, embeddable, with per-session pricing
• Use cases:
	• Business analytics

	• Get business insights using data
• Integrated with RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3…
• In-memory computation using SPICE engine if data is imported into QuickSight
• Enterprise edition: Possibility to setup Column-Level security (CLS)



QuickSight – Dashboard & Analysis:
• Define Users (standard versions) and Groups (enterprise version)
• These users & groups only exist within QuickSight, not IAM !!
• A dashboard…
	• is a read-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share
	• preserves the configuration of the analysis (filtering, parameters, controls, sort)
• You can share the analysis or the dashboard with Users or Groups
• To share a dashboard, you must first publish it
• Users who see the dashboard can also see the underlying data 





81
##Glue
-------------------------------------------------
A fully managed extract, transform, and load 
	(ETL = one or more source databases into a target database or information warehouse) 
service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics.

Amazon Athena and AWS Glue can be categorized as "Big Data" tools.

AWS Glue provides both visual and code-based interfaces to make data integration easier. 
Users can easily find and access data using the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

The purpose of Glue is to facilitate the construction of an enterprise-class data warehouse. 
It can move information into the warehouse from a variety of sources, including 
transactional databases and the Amazon cloud.


AWS Glue Data Catalog:
	Glue Data Catalog provides centralized uniform metadata storing for tracking, querying and transforming data using saved metadata.




Glue – things to know at a high-level:
• Glue Job Bookmarks: prevent re-processing old data
• Glue Elastic Views:
	• Combine and replicate data across multiple data stores using SQL
	• No custom code, Glue monitors for changes in the source data, serverless
	• Leverages a “virtual table” (materialized view)
• Glue DataBrew: clean and normalize data using pre-built transformation
• Glue Studio: new GUI to create, run and monitor ETL jobs in Glue
• Glue Streaming ETL (built on Apache Spark Structured Streaming):
  compatible with Kinesis Data Streaming, Kafka, MSK (managed Kafka)


What is difference between AWS Glue and lambda?
Glue can only execute jobs using Scala or Python code. 
Lambda can execute code from triggers by other services (SQS, Kafka, DynamoDB, Kinesis, CloudWatch, etc.) vs. 
Glue which can be triggered by lambda events, another Glue jobs, manually or from a schedule.

Using AWS Glue involves significant development efforts to write custom migration scripts to 
copy the database data into Redshift.


AWS Glue job is meant to be used for batch ETL data processing. 
AWS Glue does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre.


Area:
=====
Regional.
AWS Glue is available in several AWS Regions


UseCase:
========
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for 
analytics, machine learning, and application development.


BillCost:
=========
With AWS Glue, you pay an hourly rate, billed by the second, for crawlers (discovering data) and ETL jobs 
processing and loading data). 
For the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you pay a simple monthly fee for storing and accessing the metadata.



Security:
=========
IAM, VPC, KMS, SSL (like RDS).
We provide server-side encryption for data at rest and SSL for data in motion.





82
++AWS Lake Formation | AWS Lake Formation 
-------------------------------------------------
Use AWS Lake Formation to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account.

AWS Lake Formation is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. 
A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, 
both in its original form and prepared for analysis. 

Amazon S3 forms the storage layer for Lake Formation. 



• Data lake = central place to have all your data for analytics purposes
• Fully managed service that makes it easy to setup a data lake in days
• Discover, cleanse, transform, and ingest data into your Data Lake
• It automates many complex manual steps (collecting, cleansing, moving, cataloging data, …) 
  and de-duplicate (using ML Transforms)
• Combine structured and unstructured data in the data lake
• Out-of-the-box source blueprints: S3, RDS, Relational & NoSQL DB…
• Fing-grained Access Control for your applications (row and column-level).
• Built on top of AWS Glue.



AWS Lake Formation is integrated with AWS Glue which you can use to create a data catalog 
that describes available datasets and their appropriate business applications. 
 
You can assign permissions to IAM users, roles, groups, and Active Directory users using federation. 
You specify permissions on catalog objects (like tables and columns) rather than on buckets and objects.


Setting up a Kinesis Firehose in each and every account to move data into a single location 
is costly and impractical. A better approach is to set up cross-account sharing which is 
free with AWS Lake Formation.




83
##Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
-------------------------------------------------

What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed pub-sub messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of 
data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.


• Alternative to Amazon Kinesis
• Fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS
• Allow you to create, update, delete clusters
• MSK creates & manages Kafka brokers nodes & Zookeeper nodes for you
• Deploy the MSK cluster in your VPC, multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA)
• Automatic recovery from common Apache Kafka failures
• Data is stored on EBS volumes for as long as you want
• MSK Serverless
• Run Apache Kafka on MSK without managing the capacity
• MSK automatically provisions resources and scales compute & storage



Kinesis Data Streams vs Amazon MSK:
	Kinesis Data Streams:
		• 1 MB message size limit
		• Data Streams with Shards
		• Shard Splitting & Merging
		• TLS In-flight encryption
		• KMS at-rest encryption

	Amazon MSK
		• 1MB default, configure for higher (ex: 10MB)
		• Kafka Topics with Partitions
		• Can only add partitions to a topic
		• PLAINTEXT or TLS In-flight Encryption
		• KMS at-rest encryption

ExamTips:Need to know both different.



Big Data Ingestion Pipeline?
	• We want the ingestion pipeline to be fully serverless
	• We want to collect data in real time
	• We want to transform the data
	• We want to query the transformed data using SQL
	• The reports created using the queries should be in S3
	• We want to load that data into a warehouse and create dashboards


Big Data Ingestion Pipeline discussion
	• IoT Core allows you to harvest data from IoT devices
	• Kinesis is great for real-time data collection
	• Firehose helps with data delivery to S3 in near real-time (1 minute)

==|AWS Monitoring, Audit and Performance

96
##AWS Monitoring 
-------------------------------------------------
AWS monitoring is a set of practices you can use to verify the security and performance of your AWS resources and data.

Use a single platform for observability, Collect metrics on AWS and on premises.






97
##CloudWatch 
-------------------------------------------------
AWS CloudWatch is made up of multiple monitoring tools such as:
	Events - You can trigger an action based on an event.
	Alarms - With alarms, you need to define a threshold, a condition, and what to trigger.
	Logs - CloudWatch logs allow you to store the log files for various sources such as 
		EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and many more. You can then use these logs to detect issues, 
		find leaks, patterns, and so on.
		
		
CloudWatch enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, and services) 
and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR). 


CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. EC2—puts metrics into the repository, and you retrieve statistics based on those metrics. 
If you put your own custom metrics into the repository, you can retrieve statistics on these metrics as well.

Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. 
CloudWatch alarms perform an action when a CloudWatch metric exceeds a specified value for some amount of time.

Amazon CloudWatch can load all the metrics in your account 
(both AWS resource metrics and application metrics that you provide) for search, graphing, and alarms.




Amazon CloudWatch cannot track the API calls to your AWS resources.
CloudWatch is all about performance. CloudTrail is all about auditing also API call.


• EC2 instance metrics have metrics “every 5 minutes”
• With detailed monitoring (for a cost), you get data “every 1 minute”

Install the CloudWatch agent to all the EC2 instances that gather the memory and disk utilization data. 
View the custom metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch console.

By default, CloudWatch does not automatically provide memory and disk utilization metrics of your instances. 
You have to set up custom CloudWatch metrics to monitor the memory, 
disk swap, disk space, and page file utilization of your instances.

Enhanced Monitoring is a feature of Amazon RDS. 
By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the CloudWatch Logs.


CloudWatch Alarms only monitor service metrics, not changes in DynamoDB table data.


Custom metrics that you can set up:
– Memory utilization
– Disk swap utilization
– Disk space utilization
– Page file utilization
– Log collection


Area:
=====

AWS X-Ray:
-------------------------------------------------
It helps you debug and analyze your microservices applications with request tracing 
so you can find the root cause of issues and performance.

AWS X-Ray is NOT a suitable service to use to track each API call to your AWS resources. 








98
##AWS CloudWatch Metrics
-------------------------------------------------
Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. 

By default, many services provide free metrics for resources 
such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon RDS DB instances. 

You can also enable detailed monitoring for some resources, such as your Amazon EC2 instances, 
or publish your own application metrics. 

Amazon CloudWatch can load all the metrics in your account 
(both AWS resource metrics and application metrics that you provide) for search, graphing, and alarms.


• CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
• Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn…)
• Metrics belong to namespaces
• Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc…).
• Up to 10 dimensions per metric
• Metrics have timestamps
• Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics
• Can create CloudWatch Custom Metrics (for the RAM for example)

Option to filter metrics to only stream a subset of them.


Dimensions are name/value pairs that categorize metric characteristics. 
Each metric you create can have up to 10 dimensions defined. 
You can use these dimensions to distinguish between multiple instances of the same service and to 
filter metrics by service use. For example, you can assign InstanceId dimensions to your 
EC2 instances to distinguish between them for monitoring.





$$
99
##CloudWatch Custom Metrics
-------------------------------------------------
A custom metric enables you to monitor a specific application binary or runtime. 
CloudWatch helps you monitor the infrastructure portion of an EC2 instance, such as CPU, hard disk and network.

When CloudWatch doesn't have a metric for your specific use case, you'll want to implement a custom metric.
You can define custom metrics for your own use, and Elastic Beanstalk will push those metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.

Possibility to define and send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch
• Example: memory (RAM) usage, disk space, number of logged in users …
• Use API call PutMetricData


Important: Accepts metric data points is two weeks in the past and two hours in the
           future (make sure to configure your EC2 instance time correctly)



CloudWatch Metric Streams:
Continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice, with near-real-time delivery and low latency.
	• Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose (and then its destinations)
	• 3rd party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Splunk, Sumo Logic…
	• Option to filter metrics to only stream a subset of them.




$$
100
##CloudWatch Dashboards
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon CloudWatch dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to 
monitor your resources in a single view, even those resources that are spread across different Regions. 

You can use CloudWatch dashboards to create customized views of the metrics and alarms for your AWS resources.

• Dashboards can include graphs from different AWS accounts and regions
• Dashboards can be shared with people who don’t have an AWS account (public,
email address, 3rd party SSO provider through Amazon Cognito)



Area:
=====
Dashboards are global



UseCase:

101
##CloudWatch Logs
-------------------------------------------------
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from  EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, 
and other sources.

CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and 
AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service.


CloudWatch Logs - Sources:
• EC2
• SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent, CloudWatch Unified Agent 
• ElasticBeanstalk: collection of logs from application 
• ECS: collection from containers 
• AWS Lambda: collection from function logs 
• VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs 
• API Gateway 
• CloudTrail based on filter 
• Route53: Log DNS queries


CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter & Insights:
• CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions
	• For example, find a specific IP inside of a log
	• Or count occurrences of “ERROR” in your logs
• Metric filters can be used to trigger CloudWatch alarms
• CloudWatch Logs Insights can be used to query logs and add queries to CloudWatch Dashboards



CloudWatch Logs – S3 Export:
• Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export
• The API call is CreateExportTask
• Not near-real time or real-time… use Logs Subscriptions instead




• Log groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application
• Log stream: instances within application / log files / containers
• Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 30 days, etc..)


CloudWatch Logs can send logs to:
	• Amazon S3 (exports)
	• Kinesis Data Streams
	• Kinesis Data Firehose
	• AWS Lambda
	• ElasticSearch


CloudWatch Logs for EC2:
	• By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch
	• You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
	• Make sure IAM permissions are correct
	• The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too


CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services 
that you use, in a single, highly scalable service.

CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in 
Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 
You can perform queries to help you more efficiently 
and effectively respond to operational issues like: Top 10 IP to make request.

102
##CloudWatch Agent | Logs Agent
-------------------------------------------------
The CloudWatch Logs agent provides an automated way to send log data to CloudWatch Logs from Amazon EC2 instances. 

The agent includes the following components:
A plug-in to the AWS CLI that pushes log data to CloudWatch Logs.
A script (daemon) that initiates the process to push data to CloudWatch Logs.
A cron job that ensures that the daemon is always running.



CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent:
• For virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premises servers…)
• CloudWatch Logs Agent
	• Old version of the agent
	• Can only send to CloudWatch Logs
• CloudWatch Unified Agent
	• Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc…
	• Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
	• Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store


CloudWatch Unified Agent – Metrics:
	• Collected directly on your Linux server / EC2 instance
	• CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal)
	• Disk metrics (free, used, total), Disk IO (writes, reads, bytes, iops)
	• RAM (free, inactive, used, total, cached)
	• Netstat (number of TCP and UDP connections, net packets, bytes)
	• Processes (total, dead, bloqued, idle, running, sleep)
	• Swap Space (free, used, used %)
Reminder: out-of-the box metrics for EC2 – disk, CPU, network (high level)






103
##CloudWatch Alarms
-------------------------------------------------
An alarm watches a single metric over a specified time period, and performs one or more specified actions,
based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over time. 

You can attach multiple Alarms to each metric and each one can have multiple actions.
A CloudWatch Alarm is always in one of three states: OK, ALARM, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA
 
CloudWatch Alarm Targets:
	• Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an EC2 Instance
	• Trigger Auto Scaling Action
	• Send notification to SNS (from which you can do pretty much anything)


• Recovery: Same Private, Public, Elastic IP, metadata, placement group


To test alarms and notifications, set the alarm state to Alarm using CLI
=>aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes"





104
##CloudWatch Events
-------------------------------------------------
Event:
An event indicates a change in an environment such as an AWS environment, a SaaS partner service or application, 
or one of your applications or services. 

The following are examples of events:
Amazon EC2 generates an event when the state of an instance changes from pending to running.
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling generates events when it launches or terminates instances.
AWS CloudTrail publishes events when you make API calls.

You can also set up scheduled events that are generated on a periodic basis.
Events are represented as JSON objects and they all have a similar structure, and the same top-level fields.


Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.

• Event Pattern: Intercept events from AWS services (Sources)
	• Example sources: EC2 Instance Start, CodeBuild Failure, S3, Trusted Advisor
	• Can intercept any API call with CloudTrail integration
• Schedule or Cron (example: create an event every 4 hours)

• A JSON payload is created from the event and passed to a target…
	• Compute: Lambda, Batch, ECS task
	• Integration: SQS, SNS, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose
	• Orchestration: Step Functions, CodePipeline, CodeBuild
	• Maintenance: SSM, EC2 Actions




105
##EventBridge
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale 
by leveraging events generated by your applications, integrated SaaS applications, and AWS services. 

EventBridge streams real-time data from event sources like Zendesk or Shopify to destinations like AWS 
Lambda and other SaaS applications.

Those events can come from state changes of AWS services, other AWS accounts, or external 
applications like Auth0, Shopify, and others. You can, of course, also send your custom messages.


Customers can integrate their own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications, and custom 
applications as event sources that publish events to an event bus. 

You can define a filtering rule to filter events and route them to AWS service 
targets and API destinations (via HTTP endpoints).

EventBridge sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every minute for everything from the number of 
matched events to the number of times a target is invoked by a rule.


In EventBridge, there are three types of event bus:
	Default event bus: Every account has a default bus, which accepts events emitted by AWS services.
	Partner event bus: This can receive events from applications hosted at AWS SaaS partners. 
		For each SaaS partner, a separate event bus needs to be created.
	Custom event bus: This type can receive events from custom applications and services.


• Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts



Amazon EventBridge vs CloudWatch Events:
• Amazon EventBridge builds upon and extends CloudWatch Events.
• It uses the same service API and endpoint, and the same underlying service infrastructure.
• EventBridge allows extension to add event buses for your custom applications and your third-party SaaS apps.
• Event Bridge has the Schema Registry capability
• EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities
• Over time, the CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge.

You can use Amazon EventBridge to run Amazon ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur. 
You can set up an EventBridge rule that runs an Amazon ECS task whenever a file is uploaded to a certain Amazon S3 bucket using 
the Amazon S3 PUT operation.


• Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts using Resource-based Policies
• You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
• Ability to replay archived events



What is a schema?
A schema represents the structure of an event, and commonly includes information such as the title and type 
of each piece of data. Schema can be versioned.

The Schema Registry:
	The registry also enables you to generate code bindings for programming languages like Java, Python, 
	or TypeScript directly in your IDE, allowing you to use the event as an object in your code.



Whatever the event type you're acting upon, your application will need to know the basic structure of the event. 


Amazon EventBridge – Resource-based Policy:
• Manage permissions for a specific Event Bus
• Example: allow/deny events from another AWS account or AWS region
• Use case: aggregate all events from your AWS Organization in a single AWS account or AWS region



CloudWatch Container Insights:
• Collect, aggregate, summarize metrics and logs from containers
• Available for containers on…
	• Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
	• Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (Amazon EKS)
	• Kubernetes platforms on EC2
	• Fargate (both for ECS and EKS)
In Amazon EKS and Kubernetes, CloudWatch Insights is using a containerized version 
of the CloudWatch Agent to discover containers.



CloudWatch Lambda Insights:
	• Monitoring and troubleshooting solution for serverless applications running on AWS Lambda
	• Collects, aggregates, and summarizes system-level metrics including CPU time, memory, disk, and network
	• Collects, aggregates, and summarizes diagnostic information such as cold starts and Lambda worker shutdowns
	• Lambda Insights is provided as a Lambda Layer




CloudWatch Contributor Insights:
Contributor Insights helps you understand who or what is impacting your system and application performance 
by pinpointing outliers, finding the heaviest traffic patterns, and ranking the top system processes. 

	• Analyze log data and create time series that display contributor data.
	• See metrics about the top-N contributors
	• The total number of unique contributors, and their usage.
	• This helps you find top talkers and understand who or what is impacting system performance.
	• Works for any AWS-generated logs (VPC, DNS, etc..)
	• For example, you can find bad hosts, identify the heaviest network users, or find the 
	  URLs that generate the most errors.
	• You can build your rules from scratch, or you can also use sample rules that AWS has 
	  created – leverages your CloudWatch Logs
	• CloudWatch also provides built-in rules that you can use to analyze metrics from other AWS services.



CloudWatch Application Insights:
	• Provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications, 
	  to help isolate ongoing issues.
	• Findings and alerts are sent to Amazon EventBridge and SSM OpsCenter

##CloudTrail
-------------------------------------------------
The two services, CloudWatch and CloudTrail, can be used together. 

CloudTrail is primarily used to monitor and record the account activity across your 
AWS resources and not your web applications. 
 
You cannot use CloudTrail to capture the detailed 
information of all HTTP requests that go through your public-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB). 
 
CloudTrail can only track the resource changes made to your ALB, but not the actual IP traffic that goes through it.


• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
• If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!


Configure AWS CloudTrail to record all account activity - AWS recommends to turn on 
CloudTrail to log all IAM actions for monitoring and audit purposes.


Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. 
Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.


There are two types of events that can be logged in CloudTrail: 
Management events and Data events.

Management events provide information about management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account.
Think of Management events as things normally done by people when they are in AWS. 

Examples:
a user sign in
a policy changed
a newly created security configuration
a logging rule deletion


Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or in a resource.
Think of Data events as things normally done by software when hitting various AWS endpoints. 

Examples:
S3 object-level API activity
Lambda function execution activity
By default, CloudTrail logs management events, but not data events.


CloudTrail Events
• Management Events:
	• Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
  Examples:
	• Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
	• Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
	• Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
	• By default, trails are configured to log management events.
	• Can separate Read Events (that don’t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources)
• Data Events:
	• By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)
	• Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events
	• AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)


CloudTrail Insights:
CloudTrail Insights automatically analyzes write management events from 
CloudTrail trails and alerts you to unusual activity.

CloudTrail Insights is designed to automatically( Amazon applying Machine Learning to your CloudTrail Events) 
analyze management events from your CloudTrail trails to 
establish a baseline for normal behavior, and then raise issues by generating Insights events when it 
detects unusual patterns.

  Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
	• inaccurate resource provisioning
	• hitting service limits
	• Bursts of AWS IAM actions
	• Gaps in periodic maintenance activity
• CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
	• And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns
	• Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
	• Event is sent to Amazon S3
	• An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)

CloudTrail Events Retention:
• Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
• To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena


The difference between CloudTrail Insights and CloudTrail Events? 
CloudTrail Events are a log of every event that takes place inside your AWS environment 
whereas CloudTrail Insights applies 
Machine Learning to report on “insights” into groups of events that deviate from expected behavior.

CloudWatch mainly monitors performance, whereas CloudTrail mainly monitors actions in your AWS environment.



UseCase:
========
AWS CloudTrail is a service that automatically records events such as AWS API calls. 
Audit activity: Monitor, store, and validate activity events for authenticity. 



BillCost:
=========
For CloudTrail Insights, choose which event to analyze and pay as you go.
For AWS CloudTrail Lake, you pay for ingestion and storage together. 
You can store your data for up to seven years. 
Choose which data to analyze, and pay as you go.



Security:
=========
Track user activity and API usage AWS CloudTrail.
	
By default, CloudTrail log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 Server Side Encryption (SSE) 
and placed into your S3 bucket. 
You can control access to log files by applying IAM or S3 bucket policies. 
You can add an additional layer of security by 
enabling S3 Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete on your S3 bucket.

##AWS Config
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. 

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of 
your AWS resources. 

Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to 
automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.

• Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources
• Helps record configurations and changes over time

• Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
	• Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
	• Do my buckets have any public access?
	• How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
	• You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes
	• AWS Config is a per-region service
	• Can be aggregated across regions and accounts
	• Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)


ConfigRule:
	AWS Config rules evaluate the configuration settings of your AWS resources. 
	A rule can run when AWS Config detects a configuration change to an AWS resource or at 
	a periodic frequency that you choose (for example, every 24 hours). 
	There are two types of rules: 
		AWS Config Managed Rules and 
		AWS Config Custom Rules. 
	Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by AWS Config.

After you activate a rule, AWS Config compares your resources to the conditions of the rule. 
After this initial evaluation, AWS Config continues to run evaluations each time one is triggered.

AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)
You can set Remediation Retries if the resource is still non-compliant after auto- remediation


Config Rules – Remediations:
Automate remediation of non-compliant resources using SSM Automation Documents
You can set Remediation Retries if the resource is still non-compliant after auto- remediation


Config Rules – Notifications:
• Use EventBridge to trigger notifications when AWS resources are noncompliant
• Ability to send configuration changes and compliance state notifications 
  to SNS (all events – use SNS Filtering or filter at client-side)




CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config:
CloudWatch 
	• Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network, etc…) & dashboards 
	• Events & Alerting 
	• Log Aggregation & Analysis 
CloudTrail 
	• Record API calls made within your Account by everyone 
	• Can define trails for specific resources 
	• Global Service 
Config 
	• Record configuration changes 
	• Evaluate resources against compliance rules 
	• Get timeline of changes and compliance


For an Elastic Load Balancer:
CloudWatch:
	• Monitoring Incoming connections metric
	• Visualize error codes as % over time
	• Make a dashboard to get an idea of your load balancer performance
Config:
	• Track security group rules for the Load Balancer
	• Track configuration changes for the Load Balancer
	• Ensure an SSL certificate is always assigned to the Load Balancer (compliance)
CloudTrail:
	• Track who made any changes to the Load Balancer with API calls


Use the AWS Config managed rule to check if the IAM user access keys are not rotated within 90 days. 
Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for the non-compliant keys, 
and define a target to invoke a custom Lambda function to deactivate and delete the keys. 

AWS EventBridge can check for AWS Config non-compliant events and then trigger a Lambda for remediation.


AWS Config can only use Systems Manager Automation documents as remediation actions. 
Moreover, the AWS Batch service cannot be used for remediating non-compliant resources like IAM access keys.

Amazon EventBridge cannot directly check for IAM events that contain the age of IAM access keys. 
You have to use the AWS Config service to detect the non-compliant IAM keys.

##Organizations
-------------------------------------------------
How do you centralize your management (billing, access control, compliance and security) across multiple AWS accounts?
Welcome AWS Organizations! administer them as a single unit.

Organize accounts into Organizational Units (OU) Provides API to automate creation of new accounts.

Global service
• Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
• The main account is the management account
• Other accounts are member accounts
• Member accounts can only be part of one organization
• Consolidated Billing across all accounts - single payment method
• Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3…)
• Shared reserved instances and Savings Plans discounts across accounts
• API is available to automate AWS account creation
• Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
• The main account is the master account – you can’t change it
• Other accounts are member accounts
• Member accounts can only be part of one organization


Advantages:
	• Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
	• Use tagging standards for billing purposes
	• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
	• Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account
	• Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes
Security: Service Control Policies (SCP):
	• IAM policies applied to OU or Accounts to restrict Users and Roles
	• They do not apply to the management account (full admin power)
	• Must have an explicit allow (does not allow anything by default – like IAM)



An organizational unit (OU) provides a means to group accounts within a root. An OU can also contain other OUs. 
When you attach a policy to one of the nodes in the hierarchy, it flows down and affects 
all the branches (OUs) and leaves (accounts) beneath it. An OU can have exactly one parent, and each account can be a 
member of exactly one OU.

Organizations typically have multiple AWS accounts
Different business units
Different environments



Features:
-One consolidated bill for all AWS accounts
-Centralized compliance management for AWS Config Rules
-Send AWS CloudTrail data to one S3 bucket (across accounts)
-AWS Firewall Manager to manage firewall rules (across accounts)
-AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced protections and Security Groups
-Use Service control policies (SCPs) to define restrictions for actions (across accounts).
-Prevent users from disabling AWS Config or changing its rules
-Require MFA to stop an Amazon EC2 instance
-Require a tag upon resource creation



Service Control Policies (SCP):
	SCPs are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. 

SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization.

SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. 
They affect only the member accounts in your organization.

• Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
• Applied at the OU or Account level
• Does not apply to the Master Account
• SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root user
• The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
	• Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and can't be restricted by SCPs.
• SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
Use cases:
	• Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)
	• Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services
Master Account Can do anything (no SCP apply)




AWS Organization – Moving Accounts:
To migrate accounts from one organization to another
	1. Remove the member account from the old organization
	2. Send an invite to the new organization
	3. Accept the invite to the new organization from the member account

If you want the master account of the old organization to also join the new organization, do the following:
	1. Remove the member accounts from the organizations using procedure above
	2. Delete the old organization
	3. Repeat the process above to invite the old master account to the new org


IAM Permission Boundaries( with User and Role):
• IAM Permission Boundaries are supported for users and roles (not groups)
• Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get.

Use cases:
• Delegate responsibilities to non administrators within their permission boundaries, for example create new IAM users.
• Allow developers to self-assign policies and manage their own permissions, while
  making sure they can’t “escalate” their privileges (= make themselves admin).




Area:
=====
Global service.



UseCase:
========
Automate the creation of AWS accounts and categorize workloads using groups
Implement and enforce audit and compliance policies

• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
• Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account
• Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes

107
++IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies
-------------------------------------------------

• When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the 
   permissions assigned to the role.
• When using a resource based policy, the principal doesn’t have to give up his permissions.
• Example: User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B.
• Supported by: Amazon S3 buckets, SNS topics, SQS queues.



How to access from AccA   to AccB S3 ?
	Way1
	From AccA asumeRole using STS (AWS Security Token Service),the Role of AccB to Access S3 of AccB.

	Way2
	Create a backet with the policy that allow the AccA in AccB.


Example:Supose  From AccA, scan a DaynamoDB table and dump it to AccB.

If you asumeRole from AccB, it not work. 
Because you asume a role of AccB then you lost the access of you self account access.
In this case you have to use resouece base policy.






++Amazon EventBridge – Security
-------------------------------------------------
When a rule runs, it needs permissions from the target.
	• Resource-based policy: Lambda, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch Logs, API Gateway…
	• IAM role: Kinesis stream, Systems Manager Run Command, ECS task…





108
##AWS Cognito
-------------------------------------------------
Cognito only helps with authentication, not authorization.
Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps easyly.

Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, 
such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.  



The two main components of Amazon Cognito are User pools and Identity pools. 
	User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. 
	With an Identity pool, your users can obtain temporary Amazon credentials to access Amazon services, 
	such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. 
	
You can use Identity pools and  User pools separately or together.


AWS Cognito:
• We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our application.
Cognito UserPools: appUser->CUP->ALBOrAPIGateway->LambdaOrOtherBackend
	• Sign in functionality for app users
	• Integrate with API Gateway
Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):appUser->CUP/ThardPartyUser->CIP->S3OrDaynamoDB.
      For direct access AWS resource, without ALB or API Gateway.
	• Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly
	• Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider.
	
CognitoSync:
	• Synchronize data from device to Cognito.
	• May be deprecated and replaced by AppSync

With Amazon Cognito, you can save user data in datasets that contain key-value pairs. 
Amazon Cognito associates this data with an identity in your identity pool so that your 
app can access it across logins and devices. To sync this data between the 
Amazon Cognito service and an end user’s devices, invoke the synchronize method. 
Each dataset can have a maximum size of 1 MB. You can associate up to 20 datasets with an identity.
https://blog.knoldus.com/starting-with-aws-cognito-sync/



Cognito User Pools (CUP):
	• Create a serverless database of user for your mobile apps
	• Simple login: Username (or email) / password combination
	• Possibility to verify emails / phone numbers and add MFA
	• Can enable Federated Identities (Facebook, Google, SAML…)
	• Sends back a JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
	• Can be integrated with API Gateway for authentication
Users can then access AWS services directly or through API Gateway.


Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identities):
	• Get identities for “users” so they obtain temporary AWS credentials
	• Users source can be Cognito User Pools, 3rd party logins, etc…
	• Users can then access AWS services directly or through API Gateway
	• The IAM policies applied to the credentials are defined in Cognito
	• They can be customized based on the user_id for fine grained control
	• Default IAM roles for authenticated and guest users



Cognito= “hundreds of users”, ”mobile users”, “authenticate with SAML”

Area:
=====
Regional.
Amazon Cognito user pools are each created in one AWS Region, and they store the user profile data only in that region. 
User pools can send user data to a different AWS Region, depending on how optional features are configured.


UseCase:
========
Secure and scalable identity store
Social and enterprise identity federation
Standards-based authentication
Access control for AWS resources
Amazon Cognito provides solutions to control access to AWS resources from your app.
Easy integration with your app

For MobileUser, ThaousandOf User etc.



BillCost:
=========
Free Tier
If you are using Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only. 



Security:
=========
Amazon Cognito supports multi-factor authentication and encryption of data-at-rest and in-transit. 
Amazon Cognito is HIPAA eligible and PCI DSS, SOC, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018, and ISO 9001 compliant.





109
##IAM Identity Center | sso| Active Directory
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is now AWS IAM Identity Center. It is where you create, or connect, 
your workforce users once and centrally manage their access to multiple AWS accounts and applications.

By default, AWS SSO now provides a directory that  you can use to create users, 
organize them in groups, and set permissions across those groups.

AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) expands the capabilities of AWS Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) to provide a central place that brings together administration of users and their access to
AWS accounts and cloud applications.

AWS Single Sign-On (SSO):
• Centrally manage Single Sign-On to access multiple accounts and 3rd-party business applications.
• Integrated with AWS Organizations
• Supports SAML 2.0 markup
• Integration with on-premises Active Directory
• Centralized permission management
• Centralized auditing with CloudTrail


AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) provides single sign-on access for all of your 
AWS accounts and cloud applications. It connects with Microsoft Active Directory through 
AWS Directory Service to allow users in that directory to sign in to a personalized 
AWS access portal using their existing Active Directory user names and passwords. 
From the AWS access portal, users have access to all the AWS accounts and cloud applications 
that they have permission for.


Amazon Cognito is used for single sign-on in mobile and web applications. 
You don’t have to use it if you already have an existing Directory Service to be used for authentication.

You can use SCP if you want to restrict or implement a policy across several accounts in the organization.


AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, group, roles) or AWS resources.
A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions.

AWS supports six types of policies: 
	identity-based policies, 
	resource-based policies, 
	permissions boundaries, 
	AWS Organizations SCPs, 
	ACLs, and 
	session policies.



The AWS IAM authenticator for Kubernetes is integrated into the EKS cluster for role-based access control (RBAC) and 
cluster authentication.

Area:
=====
Global


UseCase:
========
Enable multi-account access to your AWS accounts: 
Your users can use their directory credentials for single sign-on access to multiple AWS accounts.
Enable single sign-on access to your AWS applications
Enable single sign-on access to Amazon EC2 Windows instances
Enable single sign-on access to cloud-based applications

BillCost:
=========
AWS SSO and its directory are available at no additional cost to you.



Security:

==|AWS Security & Encryption
110
##AWS Security & Encryption
-------------------------------------------------
AWS provides services that help you protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access.
	-Identity & access management
	-Network & application protection
	-Threat detection & continuous monitoring
	-Compliance & data privacy






111
##Encryption 101
-------------------------------------------------
Encryption in flight (SSL):
	• Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
	• SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
	• Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen



Server side encryption at rest:
	• Data is encrypted after being received by the server
	• Data is decrypted before being sent
	• It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
	• The encryption/decryption keys must be managed somewhere(KMS) and the server must have access to it.
It is for if the server in case hijack or stolen then data will be encryption from !


Client side encryption:
	• Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
	• Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
	• The server should not be able to decrypt the data
	• Could leverage Envelope Encryption




114
##KMS (Key Management Service)
------------------------------------------------- 
KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption 
keys used to encrypt your data. 

AWS also KMS uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys. 
You can use AWS KMS to protect your data in AWS services and in your applications.

AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide you with logs of all key usage to help meet your 
regulatory and compliance needs.
AWS KMS keys must be in the same Region as the bucket.


• Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS
• AWS manages encryption keys for us
• Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
• Easy way to control access to your data
• Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail 
  (Every single api with KMS Key call can track using cloudTrail ExamTip)
• Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM…)
• Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
	• KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI)
	• Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables

Amazon S3 uses AWS KMS keys to encrypt your Amazon S3 objects. AWS KMS encrypts only the object data.



KMS Keys Types:
KMS Keys is the new name of KMS Customer Master Key
	• Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
		• Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
		• AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
		• You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
	• Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
		• Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
		• Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
		• The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted
		• Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API

Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API



AWS KMS (Key Management Service):

Three types of KMS Keys:
	• AWS Managed Key: free (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)
	• Customer Managed Keys (CMK) created in KMS: $1 / month
	• Customer Managed Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month
• + pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

Automatic Key rotation:
	• AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year
	• Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
	• Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias

Region1->encryptEBSSnapshort->region2->copySnapshortWithDifferentEncryptKey->backToEBSWithNewkey.


• Anytime you need to share sensitive information… use KMS
	• Database passwords
	• Credentials to external service
	• Private Key of SSL certificates
• Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
• Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
• KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
• If data > 4 KB, use envelope encryption

To give access to KMS to someone:
	• Make sure the Key Policy allows the user
	• Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls
	
	
KMS Key Policies:
• Control access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies
• Difference: you cannot control access without them
	• Default KMS Key Policy:
		• Created if you don’t provide a specific KMS Key Policy
		• Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account
	• Custom KMS Key Policy:
		• Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
		• Define who can administer the key
		• Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key



Copying Snapshots across accounts:
	1. Create a Snapshot, encrypted with your own KMS Key (Customer Managed Key)
	2. Attach a KMS Key Policy to authorize cross-account access
	3. Share the encrypted snapshot
	4. (in target) Create a copy of the Snapshot, encrypt it with a CMK in your account
	5. Create a volume from the snapshot


AWS KMS enforces a waiting period. To delete a CMK in AWS KMS you schedule key deletion. 
You can set the waiting period from a minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 30 days. 
The default waiting period is 30 days.

After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key, its aliases, and all related AWS KMS metadata.



Use AWS Key Management Service to create a CMK in a custom key store and store the non-extractable key material in AWS CloudHSM.



Area:
=====
AWS KMS has been strictly isolated to a single AWS Region for each implementation, with no sharing of keys, 
policies, or audit information across Regions. 
Region isolation can help you comply with security standards and data residency requirements.


UseCase:
========
Encrypt data in your applications
Digitally sign data
Built-in auditing


BillCost:
=========
Has Free tier.
Each AWS KMS key that you create in KMS costs $1/month (prorated hourly). 
Cost for request.
The standard AWS CloudHSM charges apply



Security:
=========	
AWS KMS is designed so that no one, including AWS employees, can retrieve your plaintext keys from the service. 
The service uses hardware security modules (HSMs) that have been validated under FIPS 140-2, or are in the process 
of being validated, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.




116
++KMS Multi-Region Keys
-------------------------------------------------
• Identical KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably
• Multi-Region keys have the same key ID, key material, automatic rotation…

• Encrypt in one Region and decrypt in other Regions
• No need to re-encrypt or making cross-Region API calls

• KMS Multi-Region are NOT global (Primary + Replicas)
• Each Multi-Region key is managed independently

• Use cases: global client-side encryption, encryption on Global DynamoDB, Global Aurora



117
++DynamoDB Global Tables and KMS MultiRegion Keys Client-Side encryption:
-------------------------------------------------
• We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our DynamoDB table using the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client
• Combined with Global Tables, the client-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions
• If we use a multi-region key, replicated in the same region as the DynamoDB Global table,
  then clients in these regions can use lowlatency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side
• Using client-side encryption we can protect specific fields and guarantee only decryption if the client has access to an API key





118
++Global Aurora and KMS Multi-Region Keyspace
-------------------------------------------------
Client-Side encryption
• We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our Aurora table using the AWS Encryption SDK
• Combined with Aurora Global Tables, the client-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions
• If we use a multi-region key, replicated in the same region as the Global Aurora DB, then clients in these 
  regions can use low-latency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side.
• Using client-side encryption we can protect specific fields and guarantee only decryption
  if the client has access to an API key, we can protect specific fields even from database admins




119
++S3 Replication Encryption Considerations
-------------------------------------------------
• Unencrypted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by default
• Objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) are never replicated
• For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS, you need to enable the option
• Specify which KMS Key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket
• Adapt the KMS Key Policy for the target key
• An IAM Role with kms:Decrypt for the source KMS Key and kms:Encrypt for the target KMS Key
• You might get KMS throttling errors, in which case you can ask for a Service Quotas increase
• You can use multi-region AWS KMS Keys, but they are currently treated as
	independent keys by Amazon S3 (the object will still be decrypted and then
	encrypted)




120
++AMI Sharing Process Encrypted via KMS
-------------------------------------------------
1. AMI in Source Account is encrypted with KMS Key from Source Account
2. Must modify the image attribute to add a Launch
   Permission which corresponds to the specified target AWS account.
3. Must share the KMS Keys used to encrypted the snapshot the AMI references with the target account / IAM Role
4. The IAM Role/User in the target account must have the permissions to DescribeKey, ReEncrypted, CreateGrant, Decrypt
5. When launching an EC2 instance from the AMI, optionally the target account can specify a new KMS
   key in its own account to re-encrypt the volumes






121
##SSM Parameter Store | AWS Systems Manager
-------------------------------------------------
Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager,  configuration data  management and secrets management. 
You can store data such as passwords, database strings, 
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values. 
You can store values as plain text or encrypted data. 

You can reference Systems Manager parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, and configuration and automation workflows 
by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.


• Secure storage for configuration and secrets
• Optional Seamless Encryption using KMS
• Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
• Version tracking of configurations / secrets
• Configuration management using path & IAM
• Notifications with CloudWatch Events
• Integration with CloudFormation

122
##AWS Secrets Manager
-------------------------------------------------
This service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, 
API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. 

Using Secrets Manager - you can secure and manage secrets used to access resources in the AWS Cloud, on 
third-party services, and on-premises.

Newer service, meant for storing secrets
• Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
• Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
• Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)
• Secrets are encrypted using KMS
• Mostly meant for RDS integration

123
++AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
-------------------------------------------------
Any SSL/TLS certificates created via ACM do not need any monitoring/intervention for expiration. 
ACM automatically renews such certificates. 

Certificates provided by ACM are automatically renewed. 
ACM does not automatically renew the certificates that you import. 

AWS Config to stream configuration changes and notifications to an Amazon SNS topic.

Easily provision, manage, and deploy TLS Certificates
• Provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
• Supports both public and private TLS certificates
• Free of charge for public TLS certificates
• Automatic TLS certificate renewal
• Integrations with (load TLS certificates on)
	• Elastic Load Balancers (CLB, ALB, NLB)
	• CloudFront Distributions
	• APIs on API Gateway
• Cannot use ACM with EC2 (can’t be extracted)




124
++ACM – Requesting Public Certificates
-------------------------------------------------
1. List domain names to be included in the certificate 
	• Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): corp.example.com 
	• Wildcard Domain: *.example.com
2. Select Validation Method: DNS Validation or Email validation 
	• DNS Validation is preferred for automation purposes 
	• Email validation will send emails to contact addresses in the WHOIS database 
	• DNS Validation will leverage a CNAME record to DNS config (ex: Route 53)
3. It will take a few hours to get verified
4. The Public Certificate will be enrolled for automatic renewal 
	• ACM automatically renews ACM-generated certificates 60 days before expiry



125
++ACM – Importing Public Certificates
-------------------------------------------------
• Option to generate the certificate outside of ACM and then import it
• No automatic renewal, must import a new certificate before expiry
• ACM sends daily expiration events starting 45 days prior to expiration
• The # of days can be configured
• Events are appearing in EventBridge
• AWS Config has a managed rule named acm-certificate-expiration-check
  to check for expiring certificates (configurable number of days)



126
++API Gateway - Endpoint Types
-------------------------------------------------
• Edge-Optimized (default): For global clients
	• Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency)
	• The API Gateway still lives in only one region
• Regional:
	• For clients within the same region
	• Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strategies and the distribution)
• Private:
	• Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
	• Use a resource policy to define access



127
##WAF (Web Application Firewall)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS WAF is a web application firewall service that lets you monitor web requests and protect 
your web applications from malicious requests. 

Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses. 
You can also use AWS WAF preconfigured protections to block common attacks like 
SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

Deploy on
• Application Load Balancer
• API Gateway
• CloudFront
• AppSync GraphQL API
• Cognito User Pool

Define your Web ACL rules in WAF.

Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List):
• Rules can include: IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
• Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
• Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
• Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) – for DDoS protection




WAF – Fixed IP while using WAF with a Load Balancer
• WAF does not support the Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)
• We can use Global Accelerator for fixed IP and WAF on the ALB





You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on 
the rules in a web access control list (web ACL). With geo match conditions you can choose the countries 
from which AWS WAF should allow access.


Geo Restriction feature of CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the user's geographic location. 
But, CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC.


AWS WAF is tightly integrated with (monitor the HTTP(S) requests) Amazon CloudFront, the 
Application Load Balancer (ALB),  Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync.




Area:
=====
Global.



UseCase:
========
These conditions include 
IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

128
++Firwall Manager
-------------------------------------------------
 AWS Network Firewall is account-specific by default and needs to be integrated with the 
 AWS Firewall Manager to easily share the firewall across your other AWS accounts. 
 In addition, refactoring the web application will require an immense amount of time.
 
• Manage rules in all accounts of an AWS Organization
• Security policy: common set of security rules
	• WAF rules (Application Load Balancer, API Gateways, CloudFront)
	• AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, NLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
	• Security Groups for EC2, Application Load BAlancer and ENI resources in VPC
	• AWS Network Firewall (VPC Level)
	• Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall
	• Policies are created at the region level
• Rules are applied to new resources as they are created (good for compliance) across all and future accounts in your Organization.




129
++WAF vs. Firewall Manager vs. Shield
-------------------------------------------------
• WAF, Shield and Firewall Manager are used together for comprehensive/complate protection.
• Define your Web ACL rules in WAF
• For granular protection of your resources, WAF alone is the correct choice
• If you want to use AWS WAF across accounts, accelerate WAF configuration,
  automate the protection of new resources, use Firewall Manager with AWS WAF
• Shield Advanced adds additional features on top of AWS WAF, such as dedicated
  support from the Shield Response Team (SRT) and advanced reporting.
• If you’re prone to frequent DDoS attacks, consider purchasing Shield Advanced




DDoS Protection from AWS:
-------------------------------------------------
https://stackarmor.com/protecting-against-a-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-using-aws/
https://www.imperva.com/blog/protecting-aws-ec2-ddos-attacks/\
http://salerno-rafael.blogspot.com/2019/07/what-should-we-know-about-aws-security_27.html

There are 7 best practices identified by AWS that can be leveraged to mitigate specific attack vectors.

Based on its DDoS-resilient reference architecture, AWS separates its network components into two categories:

1)AWS Edge Location	
	BP1 = CloudFront	
	BP2 = WAF	
	BP3 = Route53	
	BP4 = API Gateway
2)AWS Regions
	BP5 = VPCs
	BP6 = ELB
	BP7 = EC2 with Auto Scaling


130
++AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency Edge Location Mitigation (BP1, BP3)
-------------------------------------------------
• BP1 – CloudFront
	• Web Application delivery at the edge
	• Protect from DDoS Common Attacks (SYN floods, UDP reflection…)
• BP1 – Global Accelerator
	• Access your application from the edge
	• Integration with Shield for DDoS protection
	• Helpful if your backend is not compatible with CloudFront
• BP3 – Route 53
	• Domain Name Resolution at the edge
	• DDoS Protection mechanism



131
++AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency Best pratices for DDoS mitigation
-------------------------------------------------
• Infrastructure layer defense (BP1, BP3, BP6)
	• Protect Amazon EC2 against high traffic
	• That includes using Global Accelerator, Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing
• Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling (BP7)
	• Helps scale in case of sudden traffic surges including a flash crowd or a DDoS attack
• Elastic Load Balancing (BP6)
	• Elastic Load Balancing scales with the traffic increases and will distribute the traffic to many EC2 instances



132
++AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency Application Layer Defense
-------------------------------------------------
• Detect and filter malicious web requests (BP1, BP2)
	• CloudFront cache static content and serve it from edge locations, protecting your backend
	• AWS WAF is used on top of CloudFront and Application Load Balancer to filter and block requests based on request signatures
	• WAF rate-based rules can automatically block the IPs of bad actors
	• Use managed rules on WAF to block attacks based on IP reputation, or block anonymous Ips
	• CloudFront can block specific geographies
• Shield Advanced (BP1, BP2, BP6)
	• Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS
  WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks




133
++AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency Attack surface reduction
-------------------------------------------------
• Obfuscating AWS resources (BP1, BP4, BP6)
	• Using CloudFront, API Gateway, Elastic Load Balancing to hide your backend resources (Lambda functions, EC2 instances)
• Security groups and Network ACLs (BP5)
	• Use security groups and NACLs to filter traffic based on specific IP at the subnet or ENI-level
	• Elastic IP are protected by AWS Shield Advanced
• Protecting API endpoints (BP4)
	• Hide EC2, Lambda, elsewhere
	• Edge-optimized mode, or CloudFront + regional mode (more control for DDoS)
	• WAF + API Gateway: burst limits, headers filtering, use API keys




134
##GuardDuty
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized 
behavior to protect your  Amazon Web Services accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. 

Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account

137
##AWS Shared Responsibility Model
-------------------------------------------------
AWS responsibility - Security of the Cloud
	• Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities, and networking) that runs all the AWS services
	• Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.

Customer responsibility - Security in the Cloud
	• For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS
	  (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
	• Encrypting application data
	• Shared controls:
	• Patch Management, Configuration Management, Awareness & Training


Example, for S3:
AWS responsibility: 
	• Guarantee you get unlimited storage 
	• Guarantee you get encryption 
	• Ensure separation of the data between different customers 
	• Ensure AWS employees can’t access your data 

Your responsibility: 
	• Bucket configuration 
	• Bucket policy / public setting 
	• IAM user and roles 
	• Enabling encryption





AWS Control Tower:
	AWS Control Tower provides a single location to easily set up your new well-architected multi-account environment 
	and govern your AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and internal compliance. 

You can automate the setup of your AWS environment with best-practices 
blueprints for multi-account structure, identity, access management, and account provisioning workflow. 
For ongoing governance, you can select and apply pre-packaged policies enterprise-wide or to specific groups of accounts.


AWS Control Tower provides three methods for creating member accounts:
	– Through the Account Factory console that is part of AWS Service Catalog.
	– Through the Enroll account feature within AWS Control Tower.
	– From your AWS Control Tower landing zone’s management account, using Lambda code and appropriate IAM roles.


AWS Control Tower automatically implements guardrails using multiple building blocks such as 
AWS CloudFormation to establish a baseline, SCPs to prevent configuration changes, 
and AWS Config rules to continuously detect non-conformance.


AWS Service Catalog:
	AWS Service Catalog is a service that allows Organizations and Teams to create and manage catalogs of IT services 
	that can be used on AWS.
	
Although Service Catalog is built on top of CloudFormation, unlike CloudFormation it's designed for sharing commonly deployed 
applications to promote collaboration. 
This means you can share the service catalog across multiple accounts and have the same constraints copy over.


 

==| Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
138
##VPC | Internet Protocol (IP)   
-------------------------------------------------
The Internet Protocol (IP) uses Three types of addressing schemes: 
Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast.

Unicast:
A Unicast address is used to identify a single unique host. 


Multicast:
	A Multicast address is used to deliver data to a group of destinations (a one-to-many transmission). 
	IP multicast group addresses are represented by class-D IP addresses reserved specifically for multicast 
	communications, ranging from 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255. 
IPv6 multicast replaces broadcast addresses that were supported in IPv4. 


Anycast:
	Anycast,  is an IP network addressing scheme that allows multiple servers to share the same 
	IP address, allowing for multiple physical destination servers to be logically identified 
	by a single IP address. 
Based on the location of the user request, the anycast routers send it to the server in the 
network based on a least-cost analysis  that includes assessing the number of hops, 
shortest distance, lowest transit cost, and minimum latency measurements to optimize the 
selection of a destination server.





139
##VPC Amazon Virtual Private Cloud 
-------------------------------------------------
VPC enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.

When you create a VPC endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. 

VPN Connections are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to 
modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. 

However, Site-to-site VPN cannot provide low latency and high throughput connection as DirectConnect.

The CIDR block for the default VPC is it's 172.31.0.0/16. It means this VPC can provide up to 65,536 IP addresses.

- It is logical Isolated from Other virtual Network in the AWS.
- Max 5 VPC can be created and 200 subnet in 1 VPC.
- We Can allocate Max 5 Elastic IP.
- Once a VPC created DHCP, NACL and Sucurity Group will be created automatically.
- A VPC is confied to on AWS Region and dos not extend between Region.

- Onece the VPC is created, Its CIDR block range can NOT change.
  (You can create another CIDR make it primary and older one will be Secondary then you can delete fitst one)
- If you need a diffenent CIDR size, create a new VPC.
- The different subnets wihtin a VPC cannot overlap.
- You can expend yor vpc CIDR by adding new/extra IP address.

VPC Two Type
- Default Vpc
- Custom Vpc

Primary diffent of this tow: default vpc has Internet Gatway custom vpc has not, you can added.


Monitor VPC by using:
CloudWatch and CloudWatch logs
VPC Flow Logs

Component of VPC:
 - CIDR and IP address subnet
 - Implied router and Routing Table
 - Internet Gatway
 - Security Group
 - Network ACL
 - Virtual Private gatway 
 - Peering connections
 - Elastic IP


-Each VPC has a main route table, by default
-Main route table has a default route enabling communication between resources in all subnets in a VPC
-Default route rule CANNOT be deleted/edited
-HOWEVER you can add/edit/delete other routing rules to the main route table



VPC Sharing:
Using VPC sharing, an account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other 
accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
The owner account cannot share the VPC itself. 

You must enable resource sharing from the management account for your organization.

You can share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that 
require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries.

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to 
route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either 
VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. 
VPC peering does not facilitate centrally managed VPCs.


Things to know:
VPC sharing allows customers to share subnets with other AWS accounts within the same AWS Organization. 
Turn on resource sharing within AWS Organizations using the management account.

	VPC sharing is only available within the same AWS Organization.
	Sharing of default VPCs/subnets is not possible.
	Participants can’t launch resources using security groups that are owned by other participants or the owner.
	Participants can’t launch resources using the default security group for the VPC because it belongs to the owner.

AWS owner account cannot share the VPC itself with another AWS account.


VPC console wizard:
	The Amazon VPC console wizard provides the following four configurations:
		1)VPC with a single public subnet.
		4)VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access
				
		2)VPC with public and private subnets (NAT) 
		3)VPC with public and private subnets and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-scenarios-intro.html



To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, the associated network 
ACL must allow both inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on as well as 
allow outbound traffic from ephemeral ports. 

When a client connects to a server, 
a random port from the ephemeral port range (1024-65535) becomes the client’s source port.


Area:
=====
VPC – Regional
VPC create on Region not available zone. all property of VPC are Regional becaus its exists on Region. 
One vpc cannot extend more then one Region.



UseCase:
========
Private Network.



BillCost:
=========
There are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC itself. 

Amazon VPC costs:
If you opt to create a hardware VPN connection associated with your VPC using Virtual Private Gateway, you will have to pay for each 
VPN connection hour that your VPN connection is provisioned and available. 
Each partial VPN connection hour consumed is billed as a full hour. 
You'll also incur standard AWS data transfer charges for all data transferred via the VPN connection. 

If you create a NAT gateway in your VPC, Charges are levied for each NAT gateway hour that your NAT gateway is 
provisioned and available for. Data processing charges apply for each gigabyte processed through a NAT gateway. 
Each partial NAT gateway hour consumed is billed as a full hour.




Security:
=========
Security groups in a VPC specify which traffic is allowed to or from an Amazon EC2 instance. 
Network ACLs operate at the subnet level and evaluate traffic entering and exiting a subnet. 
Network ACLs can be used to set both Allow and Deny rules. 
Network ACLs do not filter traffic  between instances in the same subnet. 
In addition, network ACLs perform stateless filtering while 
security groups perform stateful filteri

Default VPC has default CIDR, Security Group, NACL and Route table setting.

Security products and features:
-Security groups - This acts as a firewall for the EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
-Network access control lists (ACLs)- It acts as a firewall for the subnets, controlling inbound/outbound traffic at the subnet level.
-Flow logs - These capture the inbound and outbound traffic from the network interfaces in your VPC.








140
##CIDR
-------------------------------------------------
The /32 denotes one IP address and the /0 refers to the entire network.

The allowed block size is between  /16 netmask to /28 netmask.
The CIDR block must not overlap with any existing CIDR block that's associated with the VPC.
The CIDR block must not be the same or larger than a destination CIDR range in a route in any of the VPC route tables. 


CIDR blocks from the RFC 1918* range:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
198.19.0.0/16

192.168.0.0/16


Private IP can only allow certain values:
	• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)  big networks
	• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)  AWS default VPC in that range
	• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) home networks
All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public




141
##Default VPC Walkthrough
-------------------------------------------------
• All AWS accounts have a default VPC
• New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified
• Default VPC has Internet connectivity and all EC2 instances inside it have public IPv4 addresses
• We also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS names


172.31.0.0/16	local
0.0.0.0/0	internet_gateway_id

Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed:
• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)






142
##Subnet
-------------------------------------------------
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone. 
After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for 
the subnet (subnet route table). You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. 
Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.

A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate 
multiple subnets with the same subnet route table.

Public and private subnets:
If a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, 
it's known as a public subnet. other wise it's known as a private subnet.

The first four and last IP address of Subnet cannot be assigned.
Suppose a IP: 10.0.0.0/16
	- 10.0.0.0 Network address
	- 10.0.0.1 Reserved by AWS for VPC Route
	- 10.0.0.2 Reserved By AWS for DNS server
	- 10.0.0.3 Reserved By AWS for future use
	- 10.0.0.255 Brodycast Address
AWS do not support brodcust in a VPC but reserve the address.
	
	

Exam Tip, if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
• You can’t choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 – 5 = 27 < 29)
• You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 – 5 = 59 > 29)


Area:
=====
Subnet – Availability Zone
Subnet can span only a single Availability Zone
		
		
		
UseCase:
========
You can attach AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and RDS DB instances, to subnets. 
You can create subnets to group instances together according to your security and operational needs.



BillCost:
=========
There are no additional charges



Security:
=========
AWS provides two features that you can use to increase security in your VPC: security groups and network ACLs. 






143
##Internet Gateway (IGW)
-------------------------------------------------
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows 
communication between your  VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. 

• Must be created separately from a VPC
• One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
• Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access…
• Route tables must also be edited!


UseCase:
========
An internet gateway enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances) to connect to the internet 
if the resource has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.

BillCost:
=========
There's no additional charge for creating an internet gateway.




144
##Route Table 
-------------------------------------------------
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Main route table: 
	The route table that automatically comes with your VPC. It controls the routing for all 
	subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table.

Custom route table: A route table that you create for your VPC.


Destination: The range of IP addresses(subnet)  from where your  traffic to go (destination CIDR). 
For example, an external corporate network with the CIDR 172.16.0.0/12.

Target: The gateway, network interface, or connection through which to send the destination traffic; 
for example, an internet gateway.

There are no additional charges.




145
##Bastion Host
-------------------------------------------------
A bastion host is a server (EC2 instance in a public subnet) whose purpose is to provide access to 
a private network from an external network, such as the Internet.


• We can use a Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances
• The bastion is in the public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
• Bastion Host security group must allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example the public
  CIDR of your corporation
• Security Group of the EC2 Instances must allow the Security Group of the Bastion Host, or the private IP of the Bastion host.

• Bastion Host security group must allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from
restricted CIDR, for example the public CIDR of your corporation.

• Security Group of the EC2 Instances must allow the Security Group of the Bastion
Host, or the private IP of the Bastion host.

Exam Tip: Make sure the bastion host only has port 22 traffic from the IP address you need,
         not from the security groups of your other EC2 instances.

##NAT Instances
-------------------------------------------------
AWS provides two kinds of NAT devices:
	NAT gateway 
	NAT instance


NAT instance = Network Address Translation
	• Allows EC2 instances in private subnets to connect to the Internet
	• Must be launched in a public subnet
	• Must disable EC2 setting: Source / destination Check
	• Must have Elastic IP attached to it
	• Route Tables must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT Instance


• Pre-configured Amazon Linux AMI is availablez
• Reached the end of standard support on December 31, 2020
• Not highly available / resilient setup out of the box
• You need to create an ASG in multi-AZ + resilient user-data script
• Internet traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance type
• You must manage Security Groups & rules:
	Inbound:
	• Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from Private Subnets
	• Allow SSH from your home network (access is provided through Internet Gateway)
	Outbound:
	• Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic to the Internet

##NAT Gateways
-------------------------------------------------
NAT device is added to the public subnet to get internet connectivity.
 

• AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
• Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
• NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
• Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
• Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
• 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 45 Gbps
• No Security Groups to manage / required

Once created, you need to update the route table associated with your private subnet to point 
internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway.
This way, the instances in your private subnet can communicate with the internet.




NAT Gateway with High Availability:
• NAT Gateway is resilient within a single Availability Zone
• Must create multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs for fault-tolerance


For single point of failure:
Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each private subnet 
to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone.


You should configure the route table in the private subnet and not the public subnet to associate 
the right instances in the private subnet.

A single NAT Gateway in each availability zone is enough. 
NAT Gateway is already redundant in nature, meaning, AWS already handles any failures that occur 
in your NAT Gateway in an availability zone.

But Use a script to manage failover between instances.

Area:
=====
Each NAT gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone



UseCase:
========
A NAT gateway supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
NAT gateways are supported for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic. 


BillCost:
=========
Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
When you provision a NAT gateway, you are charged for each hour that your 
NAT gateway is available and each Gigabyte of data that it processes. 



Security:
=========
No Security Groups to manage / required
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.







148
##NACL | Security Groups
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Network ACLs allow controlling/regulating traffic flow to and from subnets.

NACL:
	NACL also adds an additional layer of security associated with subnets that control both inbound and outbound 
	traffic at the subnet level.

• NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnets
• One NACL per Subnet, new subnets are assigned the Default NACL
• You define NACL Rules:
	• Rules have a number (1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number
	• First rule match will drive the decision
	• Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 DENY 10.0.0.10/32, the IP address will be allowed because 
	  100 has a higher precedence over 200
	• The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match
	• AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
• Newly created NACLs will deny everything
• NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet leve


Default NACL:
• Accepts everything inbound/outbound with the subnets it’s associated with
• Do NOT modify the Default NACL, instead create custom NACLs



Security Groups:
	Security Groups are used to control access (SSH, HTTP, RDP, etc.) with EC2. 
	They act as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. 
	When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to 
	the instance and security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level.

Security Groups supports only allow rules, and by default, all the rules are denied. 
You cannot deny the rule for establishing a connection.

Security Groups are stateful:
-If an outgoing request is allowed, the incoming response for it is automatically allowed.
-If an incoming request is allowed, an outgoing response for it is automatically allowed



Ephemeral Ports:
When a client initiates a request, it choose a random port from ephemeral port range and 
it expects the response from the server at that port only. 

Ports with numbers 0-1023 are called system or well-known ports; 
ports with numbers 1024-49151 are called user or registered ports, 
and ports with numbers 49152-65535 are called dynamic, private or ephemeral ports.


• For any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports
• Clients connect to a defined port, and expect a response on an ephemeral port
• Different Operating Systems use different port ranges, examples:
• IANA & MS Windows 10 è 49152 – 65535
• Many Linux Kernels è 32768 – 60999




Area:
=====
Security Groups are regional and can span AZs, but can't be cross-regional.

Security groups are specific to a single VPC, so you can't share a Security Group 
between multiple VPCs. However, you can copy a Security Group to create a new Security Group with the same 
rules in another VPC for the same AWS Account.



UseCase:
========
You cannot block specific IP addresses with Security Groups (use NACLs instead)



BillCost:
=========
There are no additional charges



Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.







149
##VPC Peering
-------------------------------------------------
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that 
enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.

VPCs, but transitive peering is not supported. In other words, VPC A can connect to B and C in the above diagram, 
but C cannot communicate with B unless directly paired.

Privately connect two VPCs using AWS’network:
• Make them behave as if they were in thesame network
• Must not have overlapping CIDRs
• You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWSaccounts/regions
• You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (works crossaccounts – same region)
• You must update route tables in each VPC’s subnets to ensure EC2 instances can communicate with each other



Since Software VPN just handles connectivity between the remote network and Amazon VPC, not able to send any data its self.
therefore it cannot be used to send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.


Area:
=====
VPC Peering – Regional



UseCase:
========
Privately connect two VPCs.



BillCost:
=========
There is no charge to create a VPC peering connection. 
There is a charge for data transfer across peering connections.



Security:
=========

##PrivateLink
-------------------------------------------------
AWS PrivateLink connects your AWS services with other AWS services through a non-public tunnel.

AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, 
and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet. 

AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly 
simplify your network architecture.




150
##VPC Endpoint
-------------------------------------------------
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services 
powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

When you use VPC endpoint, the traffic between your VPC and the other AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.

VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
• Every AWS service is publicly exposed (public URL)
• VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS services using 
  from a private network instead of using the public Internet
• They’re redundant and scale horizontally
• They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, … to access AWS Services
• In case of issues:
	• Check DNS Setting Resolution in your VPC
	• Check Route Tables


Types of Endpoints:
Interface Endpoints:
	• Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a Security Group)
	• Supports most AWS services
	• $ per hour + $ per GB of data processed
	• Supports most AWS services
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface that allows a private IP address in a subnet to connect 
VPC resources to  AWS services, such as CloudFormation,Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), SNS, and more.
	
Gateway Endpoints:
	• Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in a route table (does not use security groups)
	• Supports both S3 and DynamoDB(Only)
	• Free 
	
In contrast, a gateway endpoint is a target for a route in a route table to connect VPC resources to S3 or DynamoDB. 
Traffic is then routed from instances in a subnet to one of these two services.



Gateway or Interface Endpoint for S3?
	• Gateway is most likely going to be preferred all the time at the exam
	• Cost: free for Gateway, $ for interface endpoint
	• Interface Endpoint is preferred access is required from onpremises (Site to Site VPN or Direct Connect), 
		a different VPC or a different region



• Use Gateway Endpoint if the AWS service is either DynamoDB or S3, 
   VPC level and specify a route in the route table in subnet.
   Must be inside the VPC to use.
   Can use an IAM policies or resource policies to restrict access.
  
• Use Interface Endpoint for everything else, Subnet level required ip and SecurirtyGroup.
   Available to be used outside of the VPC with VPN, Direct Connect, or VPC peering
   Can use an IAM policies or resource policies to restrict access


A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity 
between virtual appliances in the service provider VPC and application servers in the service consumer VPC. 
You deploy the Gateway Load Balancer in the same VPC as the virtual appliances.

	Enables you to intercept traffic and route .
	Security groups and endpoint policies are not supported.
	Endpoints support IPv4 traffic only.


Lambda in VPC accessing DynamoDB:
• DynamoDB is a public service from AWS
• Option 1: Access from the public internet
	• Because Lambda is in a VPC, it needs a NAT Gateway in a public subnet and an internet gateway
• Option 2 (better & free): Access from the private VPC network
	• Deploy a VPC Gateway endpoint for DynamoDB
	• Change the Route Tables




VPC Classic Link 
-------------------------------------------------
ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic instances to a VPC in your account, within the same Region. 
If you associate the VPC security groups with a EC2-Classic instance, this enables communication between your 
EC2-Classic instance and instances in your VPC using private IPv4 addresses.


Linking your EC2-Classic instance to a VPC does not affect your EC2-Classic security groups. 
They continue to control all traffic to and from the instance. 


ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic instances to a VPC in your account
	• Must associate a security group
	• Enables communication using private IPv4 addresses
	• Removes the need to make use of public IPv4 addresses or Elastic IP addresses







Area:
=====
VPC Endpoints – Regional



UseCase:
========
Enables you to privately connect your VPC


BillCost:
=========
Interface endpoints:
AWS charges usage and data processing rates for PrivateLink, so there are additional costs 
involved with creating and using an interface endpoint. 

Gateway endpoints: do not use PrivateLink. 
Therefore, apart from the standard costs of data transfer and resource use, 
AWS doesn't charge extra for using gateway endpoints, unlike interface endpoints.

Security:
=========
It is a aws managed service, security is a shared responsibility.






151
##VPC Flow Logs
-------------------------------------------------
VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network 
interfaces in your VPC. 

Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs ors S3. 

After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.


• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	• VPC Flow Logs
	• Subnet Flow Logs
	• Elastic Network Interface (ENI) Flow Logs
• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues
• Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs
• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: ELB,
  RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, WorkSpaces, NATGW, Transit Gateway


VPC Flow Logs Syntax:
• srcaddr & dstaddr – help identify problematic IP
• srcport & dstport – help identity problematic ports
• Action – success or failure of the request due to Security Group / NACL
• Can be used for analytics on usage patterns, or malicious behavior
• Query VPC flow logs using Athena on S3 or CloudWatch Logs Insights






152
##Site to Site VPN
-------------------------------------------------
You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN 
(Site-to-Site VPN) connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection.


Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):
	• VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
	• VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection
	• Possibility to customize the ASN (Autonomous System Number)

Customer Gateway (CGW):
	• Software application or physical device on customer side of the VPN connection
	
	
Customer Gateway Device (On-premises):
• What IP address to use?
	• Public Internet-routable IP address for your Customer Gateway device
	• If it’s behind a NAT device that’s enabled for NAT traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of the NAT device

• Important step: enable Route Propagation for the Virtual Private Gateway in the route table
  that is associated with your subnets.
• If you need to ping your EC2 instances from on-premises, make sure you add the 
  ICMP protocol on the inbound of your security groups.




AWS VPN CloudHub:
• Provide secure communication between multiple sites, if you have multiple VPN connections
• Low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or secondary network connectivity between different locations (VPN only)
• It’s a VPN connection so it goes over the public Internet
• To set it up, connect multiple VPN connections on the same VGW, setup
  dynamic routing and configure route tables



AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office 
site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). 

You can securely extend your data center 
or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection. 
It uses internet protocol security (IPSec) communications to create encrypted VPN tunnels 
between two locations. 

You cannot use AWS Site-to-Site VPN to integrate data files via the NFS interface.

Area:
=====
MayRegional 



UseCase:
========
Application Migration: Moving applications to the cloud is easier with a Site-to-site 
VPN connection between your network and the AWS cloud. 

You can host Amazon VPCs behind your corporate firewall and seamlessly move your IT resources, without 
changing the way your users access these applications.
You can use AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections to securely communicate between remote sites.


BillCost:
=========
You are charged for each VPN connection hour that your VPN connection is provisioned and available.
 

Security:
=========
Site-to-Site VPN supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.
Security is a shared responsibility





153
##Direct Connect
-------------------------------------------------
DirectConnect connects your on-prem with your VPC through a non-public tunnel.
AWS Direct Connect Private dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS.

Data transfer pricing over Direct Connect is lower than data transfer pricing over the internet.

AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network 
and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.



• Provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC
• Dedicated connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct Connect locations
• You need to setup a Virtual Private Gateway on your VPC
• Access public resources (S3) and private (EC2) on same connection Supports both IPv4 and IPv6.


You can create this private connectivity to reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide more consistent network experience 
compared to regular internet-based connections.



Direct Connect Gateway:
---------------------------------------------
DirectConnecte->PrivateVertualInterface->VGW->VPC

Virtual Private Gateway or VGW is used to associated to VPC and it can work with VPN or Direct Connect.

If you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC in many
different regions (same account) for your on-parmiss, you must use a Direct Connect Gateway.

AWS Direct Connect gateway is aimed at making it easier to connect from a single 
Direct Connect location to multiple AWS regions or VPCs.

You can set up Direct Connect to bypass a parent Availability 
Zone and connect directly to the internet or through Direct Connect points-of-presence.

Use AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your VPCs. You associate an AWS Direct Connect 
gateway with either of the following gateways:
	A transit gateway when you have multiple VPCs in the same Region
	A virtual private gateway

A Direct Connect gateway does not allow gateway associations that are on the same Direct Connect 
gateway to send traffic to each other (for example, a virtual private gateway to another virtual private gateway).

A virtual interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, and is either public or private. 

A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3. 
A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC.



Direct Connect – Connection Types:
• Dedicated Connections: 1Gbps and 10 Gbps capacity
	• Physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
	• Request made to AWS first, then completed by AWS Direct Connect Partners
• Hosted Connections: 50Mbps, 500 Mbps, to 10 Gbps
	• Connection requests are made via AWS Direct Connect Partners
	• Capacity can be added or removed on demand
	• 1, 2, 5, 10 Gbps available at select AWS Direct Connect Partners
	
Lead times are often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection



Direct Connect – Encryption:
• Data in transit is not encrypted but is private
• AWS Direct Connect + VPN provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection
• Good for an extra level of security, but slightly more complex to put in place


Direct Connect - Resiliency:
-One connection at multiple locations
-Maximum resilience is achieved by separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one location.


Site-to-Site VPN connection as a backup
• In case Direct Connect fails, you can set up a backup Direct Connect connection (expensive), or a Site-to-Site VPN connection


What is the difference between Direct Connect gateway and virtual private gateway?
	The Direct Connect Gateway is connected to multiple AWS VPCs in different AWS regions via Virtual private Gateways. 
	The Direct Connect Gateway is in turn connected to the Direct Connect via a virtual private interface. 
	This allows multiple VPCs to be connected to the customer network via one virtual private interface.



Area:
=====
MayRegional


UseCase:
========
• Increase bandwidth throughput - working with large data sets – lower cost
• More consistent network experience - applications using real-time data feeds
• Hybrid Environments (on prem + cloud)

The use case for Direct Connect is high throughput workloads or if you need a stable or reliable connection




BillCost:
=========
AWS Direct Connect has two separate charges: port hours and data transfer. 
Pricing is per port-hour consumed for each port type. Partial port hours consumed are billed as full hours. 
The account that owns the port will be charged the port hour charges.



Security:
=========
• Data in transit is not encrypted but is private
• AWS Direct Connect + VPN provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection
AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between 
your intranet and Amazon VPC. ,
Customers can also implement additional security controls by encrypting the traffic that rides the direct connections 
using similar protocols like SSL, HTTPs and SSH.






154
##Transit  Gateway 
-------------------------------------------------
It acts as a cloud router that allows you to integrate multiple networks.
 
Transit Gateway is a Regional resource and can connect thousands of VPCs within the same AWS Region. 
You can create multiple Transit Gateway instances per Region, and you can 
connect to a maximum of three Transit Gateway instances over a single Direct Connect connection for hybrid connectivity.

Traffic between VPC and Transit Gateway remains on the AWS global private network and is not exposed to the public internet. 

Transit Gateway Peering:
AWS Transit Gateway supports the ability to establish peering connections between Transit Gateways in the same and different  Regions. 
Inter-region peering enables customers to extend this connectivity and build global networks spanning multiple AWS Regions.

This means that all the Amazon VPCs, Site-to-Site VPN connections, and Direct Connect gateways attached to an 
Transit Gateway hosted in one AWS Region can exchange traffic with resources deployed in other AWS Regions.

• For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
• Regional resource, can work cross-region
• Share cross-account using Resource Access Manager (RAM)
• You can peer Transit Gateways across regions
• Route Tables: limit which VPC can talk with other VPC
• Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections
• Supports IP Multicast (not supported by any other AWS service)


Transit Gateway: Site-to-Site VPN ECMP":
• ECMP = Equal-cost multi-path routing
• Routing strategy to allow to forward a packet over multiple best path
• Use case: create multiple Siteto-Site VPN connections to increase the bandwidth of your connection to AWS


Here are the steps to follow to set up a sharing Transit gateway across AWS Accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM).
	Create a Transit gateway in Account-1
	Share the Transit gateway with Account-2 using RAM
	Attach VPC’s to the Transit gateway
	Update the Routes with TGW
	Test the connection



Transit Gateway – Share Direct Connect between multiple accounts.
You can use AWS Resource Access Manager to share Transit Gateway with other accounts.



Area:
=====
Regional resource



UseCase:
========
Deliver applications around the world
Rapidly move to global scale
Smoothly respond to spikes in demanding
Host multicast applications in the cloud


Transit Gateways in different regions can peer with each other to enable VPC communications across regions. 
Transit Gateway inter-Region peering encrypts all traffic, with no single point of 
failure or bandwidth bottleneck which helps you to get improved security.



BillCost:
=========
Create multiple Siteto-Site VPN connections to increase the bandwidth of your connection to AWS
In AWS Transit Gateway you are charged for the number of connections that you make to the Transit 
Gateway per hour and the amount of traffic that flows through AWS Transit Gateway.



Security:
=========
AWS Transit Gateway inherits compliance from Amazon VPC and meets the standards for PCI DSS Level 1, 
ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, FedRAMP Moderate, 
FedRAMP High and HIPAA eligibility.





155
##VPC Traffic Mirroring
-------------------------------------------------
Traffic Mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface 
of type interface. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for:

• Allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in your VPC
• Route the traffic to security appliances that you manage
• Capture the traffic
	• From (Source) – ENIs
	• To (Targets) – an ENI or a Network Load Balancer
• Capture all packets or capture the packets of your interest (optionally, truncate packets)
• Source and Target can be in the same VPC or different VPCs (VPC Peering)
• Use cases: content inspection, threat monitoring, troubleshooting

156
##IPv6 VPC
-------------------------------------------------
Your VPC can operate in dual-stack mode — your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both. 
IPv4 and IPv6 communication are independent of each other. 

• IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC and subnets,this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC.
• You can enable IPv6 (they’re public IP addresses) to operate in dual-stack mode
• Your EC2 instances will get at least a private internal IPv4 and a public IPv6
• They can communicate using either IPv4 or IPv6 to the internet through an Internet Gateway.




157
##Egress Only Internet Gateway
-------------------------------------------------
An egress-only internet gateway is used to enable outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, 
and prevents hosts outside of your VPC from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instance.

Used for IPv6 only (similar to a NAT Gateway but for IPv6) You must update the Route Tables.

Minimizing egress traffic network cost
• Try to keep as much internet traffic within AWS to minimize costs
• Direct Connect location that are co-located in the same AWS Region result in lower cost for egress network





158
##VPC Section Summary
-------------------------------------------------
• CIDR – IP Range
• VPC – Virtual Private Cloud (list of IPv4 & IPv6 CIDR)
• Subnets – tied to an AZ, we define a CIDR
• Internet Gateway – at the VPC level, provide IPv4 & IPv6 Internet Access
• Route Tables – must be edited to add routes from subnets to the IGW, VPC Peering Connections, VPC Endpoints, …
• Bastion Host – public EC2 instance to SSH into, that has SSH connectivity to EC2 instances in private subnets
• NAT Instances – gives Internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets. Old, must be setup in a public subnet, disable Source / Destination check flag
• NAT Gateway – managed by AWS, provides scalable Internet access to private EC2 instances, IPv4 only
• Private DNS + Route 53 – enable DNS Resolution + DNS Hostnames (VPC).

• NACL – stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound, don’t forget Ephemeral Ports
• Security Groups – stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level
• Reachability Analyzer – perform network connectivity testing between AWS resources
• VPC Peering – connect two VPCs with non overlapping CIDR, non-transitive
• VPC Endpoints – provide private access to AWS Services (S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, SSM) within a VPC
• VPC Flow Logs – can be setup at the VPC / Subnet / ENI Level, for ACCEPT and REJECT traffic, helps identifying attacks, 
  analyze using Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights
• Site-to-Site VPN – setup a Customer Gateway on DC, a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and site-to-site VPN over public Internet
• VPN CloudHub – hub-and-spoke VPN model to connect your sites.
• Direct Connect – setup a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and establish a direct private connection to an AWS Direct Connect Location
• Direct Connect Gateway – setup a Direct Connect to many VPCs in different AWS regions.

AWS PrivateLink / VPC Endpoint Services:
	• Connect services privately from your service VPC to customers VPC
	• Doesn’t need VPC Peering, public Internet, NAT Gateway, Route Tables
	• Must be used with Network Load Balancer & ENI
• ClassicLink – connect EC2-Classic EC2 instances privately to your VPC
• Transit Gateway – transitive peering connections for VPC, VPN & DX
• Traffic Mirroring – copy network traffic from ENIs for further analysis
• Egress-only Internet Gateway – like a NAT Gateway, but for IPv6





159
##Networking Cost
-------------------------------------------------
• Use Private IP instead of Public IP for good savings and better network performance
• Use same AZ for maximum savings (at the cost of high availability)



Minimizing egress traffic network cost:
• Egress traffic: outbound traffic (from AWS to outside)
• Ingress traffic: inbound traffic - from outside to AWS (typically free)
• Try to keep as much internet traffic within AWS to minimize costs
• Direct Connect location that are co-located in the same AWS Region result in lower cost for egress network

##S3 Data Transfer Pricing – Analysis for USA
-------------------------------------------------
• S3 ingress: free
• S3 to Internet: $0.09 per GB
• S3 Transfer Acceleration:
	• Faster transfer times (50 to 500% better)
	• Additional cost on top of Data Transfer Pricing: +$0.04 to $0.08 per GB
	• S3 to CloudFront: $0.00 per GB
• CloudFront to Internet: $0.085 per GB (slightly cheaper than S3)
	• Caching capability (lower latency)
	• Reduce costs associated with S3 Requests Pricing (7x cheaper with CloudFront)
• S3 Cross Region Replication: $0.02 per GB

##Network Protection on AWS
-------------------------------------------------
• To protect network on AWS, we’ve seen
	• Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
	• Amazon VPC security groups
	• AWS WAF (protect against malicious requests)
	• AWS Shield & AWS Shield Advanced
	• AWS Firewall Manager (to manage them across accounts)
• But what if we want to protect in a sophisticated way our entire VPC?

Its AWS Network Firewall !!!

• Protect your entire Amazon VPC
• From Layer 3 to Layer 7 protection
• Any direction, you can inspect
	• VPC to VPC traffic
	• Outbound to internet
	• Inbound from internet
	• To / from Direct Connect & Site-to-Site VPN
• Internally, the AWS Network Firewall uses the AWS Gateway Load Balancer
• Rules can be centrally managed cross- account by AWS Firewall Manager to apply to many VPCs


Network Firewall – Fine Grained Controls:
• Supports 1000s of rules
	• IP & port - example: 10,000s of IPs filtering
	• Protocol – example: block the SMB protocol for outbound communications
	• Stateful domain list rule groups: only allow outbound traffic to *.mycorp.com or third-party software repo
	• General pattern matching using regex
• Traffic filtering: Allow, drop, or alert for the traffic that matches the rules
• Active flow inspection to protect against network threats with intrusion-prevention
  capabilities (like Gateway Load Balancer, but all managed by AWS)
• Send logs of rule matches to Amazon S3, CloudWatch Logs, Kinesis Data Firehose

AWS Network Firewall has a highly flexible rules engine, so you can build custom firewall rules to protect your unique workloads.

AWS Network Firewall’s stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, 
like tracking connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing 
your VPCs from accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol.

• Disaster recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster
• What kind of disaster recovery?
	• On-premise => On-premise: traditional DR, and very expensive
	• On-premise => AWS Cloud: hybrid recovery
	• AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B
• Need to define two terms:
	• RPO: Recovery Point Objective
	• RTO: Recovery Time Objective



RTO and RPO
-------------------------------------------------
Among the components of a DR plan are two key parameters that define:
	1)how long your business can afford to be offline and 
	2)how much data loss it can tolerate. 
These are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).


RTO:
RTO refers to how much time an application can be down without causing significant damage to the business. 
Some applications can be down for days without significant consequences. 


RPO:
RPO is your goal for the maximum amount of data the organization can tolerate losing. 
This parameter is measured in time: from the moment a failure occurs to your last valid data backup. 
For example, if you experience a failure now and your last full data backup was 24 hours ago, the RPO is 24 hours. 

If you back up all or most of your data in regularly scheduled 24-hour increments, then in the worst-case scenario you 
will lose 24 hours’ worth of data.


Disaster Recovery Strategies (Architecture of the DR strategies):
• Backup and Restore $
• Pilot Light $$
• Warm Standby $$$
• Hot Site / Multi Site Approach  $$$$
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-i-strategies-for-recovery-in-the-cloud/




Backup and restore:
Backups are created in the same Region as their source and are also copied to another Region.
Backup and restore is a suitable approach for mitigating against data loss or corruption.

For Region failover, in addition to data recovery from backup, you must also be able to restore your infrastructure 
in the recovery Region. 

Infrastructure as Code such as AWS CloudFormation or AWS Cloud Development Kit 
(AWS CDK) enables you to deploy consistent infrastructure across Regions.

The backup and recovery strategy is considered the least efficient for RTO.



Pilot Light:
With the pilot light strategy, the data is live, but the services are idle. 
Live data means the data stores and databases are up-to-date (or nearly up-to-date) with the active 
Region and ready to service read operations.

In the pilot light strategy, basic infrastructure elements are in place like Elastic Load Balancing 
and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in Figure 6. But functional elements (like compute) are “shut off.” 


• A small version of the app is always running in the cloud
• Useful for the critical core (pilot light)
• Very similar to Backup and Restore
• Faster than Backup and Restore as critical systems are already up



Warm Standby :
Like the pilot light strategy, the warm standby strategy maintains live data in addition to periodic backups. 

• Full system is up and running, but at minimum size 
• Upon disaster, we can scale to production load



Multi Site / Hot Site Approach 
With multi-site active/active, two or more Regions are actively accepting requests. 
Failover consists of re-routing requests away from a Region that cannot serve them.

Here, data is replicated across Regions and is actively used to serve read requests in those Regions.
 
• Very low RTO (minutes or seconds) – very expensive 
• Full Production Scale is running AWS and On Premise




Disaster Recovery Tips:
• Backup 
	• EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / Snapshots, etc… 
	• Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication 
	• From On-Premise: Snowball or Storage Gateway 
• High Availability 
	• Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region 
	• RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3 
	• Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect 
• Replication 
	• RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases 
	• Database replication from on-premises to RDS 
	• Storage Gateway 
• Automation 
	• CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment 
	• Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail 
	• AWS Lambda functions for customized automations 
• Chaos 
	• Netflix has a “simian-army” randomly terminating EC2



Creating a highly available EC2 instance
Creating a highly available EC2 instance With an Auto Scaling Group
Creating a highly available EC2 instance With ASG + EBS


High Availability for a Bastion Host
HA options for the bastion host:
	• Run 2 across 2 AZ
	• Run 1 across 2 AZ with 1 ASG 1:1:1
Routing to the bastion host:
	• If 1 bastion host, use an elastic IP withc ec2 user-data script to access it
	• If 2 bastion hosts, use an NetworkcLoad Balancer (layer 4) deployed in multiple AZ
	• If NLB, the bastion hosts can live in the private subnet directly
Note: Can’t use ALB as the ALB is layer 7 (HTTP protocol)

##DMS (Database Migration Service)
-------------------------------------------------
The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications 
that rely on the database. 


AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as 
heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, 
such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.


You must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks.


DMS Sources and Targets:
SOURCES:
	• On-Premise and EC2 instances databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SAP, DB2
	• Azure: Azure SQL Database
	• Amazon RDS: all including Aurora
	• Amazon S3

TARGETS:
	• On-Premise and EC2 instances databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SAP
	• Amazon RDS
	• Amazon Redshift
	• Amazon DynamoDB
	• Amazon S3
	• ElasticSearch Service
	• Kinesis Data Streams
	• DocumentDB


AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):
• Convert your Database’s Schema from one engine to another
• Example OLTP: (SQL Server or Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
• Example OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to Amazon Redshift
• Prefer compute-intensive instances to optimize data conversions

You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine
• Ex: On-Premise PostgreSQL => AWS RDS PostgreSQL
• The DB engine is still PostgreSQL (RDS is the platform)




RDS & Aurora MySQL Migrations
• RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL
	• Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS MySQL restored asvMySQL Aurora DB
	• Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS MySQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it as its
      own DB cluster (can take time and cost $)
• External MySQL to Aurora MySQL
	• Option 1:
		• Use Percona XtraBackup to create a file backup in Amazon S3
		• Create an Aurora MySQL DB from Amazon S3
	• Option 2:
		• Create an Aurora MySQL DB
		• Use the mysqldump utility to migrate MySQL into Aurora (slower than S3 method)
• Use DMS if both databases are up and running




RDS & Aurora PostgreSQL Migrations:
• RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL
	• Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS PostgreSQL restored as PostgreSQL Aurora DB
	• Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS PostgreSQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it
	- as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost $)
• External PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL
	• Create a backup and put it in Amazon S3
	• Import it using the aws_s3 Aurora extension
• Use DMS if both databases are up and running


AWS Application Discovery Service :
	Application Discovery Service helps enterprises obtain a snapshot of the current state of their 
	data center servers by collecting server specification information, hardware configuration, 
	performance data, and details of running processes and network connections. 
	Once the data is collected, you can use it to perform a Total Cost of Ownership 
	(TCO) analysis and then create a cost optimized migration plan based on your unique business requirements.


On-Premise strategy with AWS:
• Ability to download Amazon Linux 2 AMI as a VM (.iso format) 
	• VMWare, KVM, VirtualBox (Oracle VM), Microsoft Hyper-V 
• VM Import / Export 
	• Migrate existing applications into EC2 
	• Create a DR repository strategy for your on-premises VMs 
	• Can export back the VMs from EC2 to on-premises 
• AWS Application Discovery Service 
	• Gather information about your on-premises servers to plan a migration 
	• Server utilization and dependency mappings 
	• Track with AWS Migration Hub 
• AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) 
	• replicate On-premise => AWS , AWS => AWS, AWS => On-premise 
	• Works with various database technologies (Oracle, MySQL, DynamoDB, etc..) 
• AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) 
	• Incremental replication of on-premises live servers to AWS



With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data with high availability 
and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to 
Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3.



AWS DMS enables you to seamlessly migrate data from supported sources to relational databases, 
data warehouses, streaming platforms, and other data stores in AWS cloud.

AWS DMS performs this task out of box without any complex configuration or code development. 
You can also configure an AWS DMS replication instance to scale up or down depending on the workload.


https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/streaming-data-from-amazon-s3-to-amazon-kinesis-data-streams-using-aws-dms/



BillCost:
=========
You only pay for your replication instances and any additional log storage. 
Each database migration instance includes storage sufficient for swap space, replication logs, 
and data cache for most replications and inbound data transfer is free.






164
##AWS Backup
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Backup is a fully managed service that enables you to centralize and automate data protection 
across on-premises and AWS services. 

Can I use AWS Backup to back up on-premises data?
Yes, you can use AWS Backup to back up your on-premises Storage Gateway (volumes) and VMware virtual machines, 
providing a common way to manage the backups of your application data both on premises and on AWS.

AWS Backup supports both of the scenarios above—it lets you backup data from Amazon EFS, 
DynamoDB, RDS or EBS, and also from on-premise resources via the AWS Storage Gateway.


AWS Backup allows you to define a central data protection policy (called a backup plan) that works across 
AWS services for compute, storage, and databases. 
The backup plan defines parameters such as backup frequency and backup retention period. 

• Fully managed service 
• Centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services 
• No need to create custom scripts and manual processes 
• Supported services: 
	• Amazon EC2 / Amazon EBS 
	• Amazon S3 
	• Amazon RDS (all DBs engines) / Amazon Aurora / Amazon DynamoDB 
	• Amazon DocumentDB / Amazon Neptune 
	• Amazon EFS / Amazon FSx (Lustre & Windows File Server) 
	• AWS Storage Gateway (Volume Gateway) 
• Supports cross-region backups 
• Supports cross-account backups

Supports PITR for supported services
• On-Demand and Scheduled backups
• Tag-based backup policies
	• You create backup policies known as Backup Plans
	• Backup frequency (every 12 hours, daily, weekly, monthly, cron expression)
	• Backup window
	• Transition to Cold Storage (Never, Days, Weeks, Months, Years)
	• Retention Period (Always, Days, Weeks, Months, Years)



AWS Backup Vault Lock:
• Enforce a WORM (Write Once Read Many) state for all the backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault
• Additional layer of defense to protect your backups against: 
	• Inadvertent or malicious delete operations 
	• Updates that shorten or alter retention periods
• Even the root user cannot delete backups when enabled



AWS Application Discovery Service:
• Plan migration projects by gathering information about on-premises data centers
• Server utilization data and dependency mapping are important for migrations
	• Agentless Discovery (AWS Agentless Discovery Connector)
	    • VM inventory, configuration, and performance history such as CPU, memory, and disk usage
	• Agent-based Discovery (AWS Application Discovery Agent)
		• System configuration, system performance, running processes, and details of the network connections between systems
	• Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration Hub


AWS Application Discovery Service helps enterprise customers plan migration projects by 
gathering information about their on-premises data centers.

Not permorming of Migration.



AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
-------------------------------------------------
You can migrate any workload – applications, websites, databases, storage, physical 
or virtual servers – and even entire data centers from an on-premises environment, 
hosting facility, or other public cloud to AWS.

With Application Migration Service, you can migrate your applications from physical infrastructure, 
VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V,  EC2, VPC, and other clouds to AWS.


• The “AWS evolution” of CloudEndure Migration, replacing AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
• Lift-and-shift (rehost) solution which simplify migrating applications to AWS
• Converts your physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to run natively on AWS
• Supports wide range of platforms, Operating Systems, and databases
• Minimal downtime, reduced costs


Differences between AWS Application Migration Service(MGN) and AWS Server Migration Service(SMS) ?
	Application Migration Service utilizes continuous, block-level replication and enables 
	short cutover  windows measured in minutes. 

	Server Migration Service utilizes incremental, snapshot-based replication 
	and enables cutover windows measured in hours.



Application Migration Service is the primary service(New) recommended to migrate your applications to AWS. 
If Application Migration Service is not available in a specific AWS Region, you can use 
SMS APIs until March 31, 2023.


CloudEndure:
	Application Migration Service is the next generation of CloudEndure Migration, and offers 
	key features and operational benefits that are not available with CloudEndure Migration. 

Application Migration Service is not yet supported in AWS GovCloud and China Regions, and 
does not currently support some legacy operating systems that are supported by CloudEndure Migration.
 
Consider using CloudEndure Migration if your preferred AWS Region or operating system is not currently 
supported by AWS Application Migration Service.

Note: While CloudEndure Migration will continue to be available for use in AWS GovCloud and 
China Regions, it will no longer be available in other AWS Regions as of December 30, 2022. 
After January 1, 2023, CloudEndure Migration will be available only for migrations to 
AWS Outposts and AWS GovCloud and China Regions.






VMware Cloud on Aws
-------------------------------------------------
• Some customers use VMware Cloud to manage their on-premises Data Center
• They want to extend the Data Center capacity to AWS, but keep using the VMware Cloud software
• …Enter VMware Cloud on AWS
• Use cases
	• Migrate your VMware vSphere-based workloads to AWS
	• Run your production workloads across VMware vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments
	• Have a disaster recover strategy
	
	
	
	
Transferring large amount of data into AWS:
• Example: transfer 200 TB of data in the cloud. We have a 100 Mbps internet connection.

• Over the internet / Site-to-Site VPN:
	• Immediate to setup
	• Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*1000(MB)*8(Mb)/100 Mbps = 16,000,000s = 185d
• Over direct connect 1Gbps:
	• Long for the one-time setup (over a month)
	• Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*8(Gb)/1 Gbps = 1,600,000s = 18.5d
• Over Snowball:
	• Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel
	• Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transfer
	• Can be combined with DMS
• For on-going replication / transfers: Site-to-Site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync

165
S3 Event Notifications
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon S3 events Lambda Function SQS SNS
• S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication…
• Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
• Use case: generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3
• Can create as many “S3 events” as desired
• S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer




S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge
-------------------------------------------------
S3->EventBridge -> Over 18 AWS services as destinations

• Advanced filtering options with JSON rules (metadata, object size, name...)
• Multiple Destinations – ex Step Functions, Kinesis Streams / Firehose…
• EventBridge Capabilities – Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery

Amazon EventBridge – Intercept API Calls
API Gateway – AWS Service Integration Kinesis Data Streams example



There are two primary methods to trigger Lambda when an object is added to an S3 bucket — 
S3 Notifications and EventBridge.

CloudTrail/EventBridge:
	CloudTrail Data events are charged at $0.10 per 100,000 events.
	EventBridge supports a larger number of target services.
	EventBridge allows you to use to extract and transform part of the event to be sent to the target.


S3 Notifications:
	There is no pricing associated with S3 Notifications. 
	S3 Notifications can target Lambda, SNS and SQS.
	Object events can filter based on a prefix or suffix or both.


166
##Caching Strategies
-------------------------------------------------
Caching helps applications perform dramatically faster and cost significantly less at scale
In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature,
 so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s 
 primary storage location. 
 
 Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.


UseCase:
========
Database Caching
Domain Name System (DNS) Caching
Session Management
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Web Caching



167
##Blocking and IP address
-------------------------------------------------
Network ACL if it allows communication between the two subnets.

To allow or block specific IP addresses for your EC2 instances, use a network Access Control List (ACL) 
or security group rules in your VPC. 

Network ACLs and security group rules act as firewalls allowing or blocking 
IP addresses from accessing your resources.



Blocking an IP address
Blocking an IP address–with an ALB
Blocking an IP address–with an NLB
Blocking an IP address – ALB + WAF
Blocking an IP address – ALB, CloudFront WAF






168
##HPC (High performance Computing)
-------------------------------------------------
HPC has been key to solving the most complex problems in every industry, and changing the way we work and live. 
From weather modeling to genome mapping to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
HPC is helping to push the boundaries of what’s possible with advanced computing technologies.


The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC
• You can create a very high number of resources in no time
• You can speed up time to results by adding more resources
• You can pay only for the systems you have used
• Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling,
  weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving
• Which services help perform HPC?



Data Management & Transfer:
• AWS Direct Connect:
	• Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network.
• Snowball & Snowmobile
	• Move PB of data to the cloud
• AWS DataSync
	• Move large amount of data between on-premises and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows




Compute and Networking:
• EC2 Instances:
• CPU optimized, GPU optimized
• Spot Instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
• EC2 Placement Groups: Cluster for good network performance



EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV):
	• Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency
	• Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100 Gbps
	• Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps – LEGACY


ParallelCluster:
	AWS ParallelCluster is just an AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes 
	it easy for you to deploy and manage High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. 

ParallelCluster uses a simple text file to model and provision all the resources needed 
for your HPC applications in an automated and secure manner.



169
##Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
-------------------------------------------------
Great for inter-node communications.

• Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
• Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
• Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
• Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

	
An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate 
High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. 
EFA enables you to achieve the application performance of 
an on-premises HPC cluster, with the scalability, flexibility, and elasticity provided by the AWS Cloud.

EFAs cannot be attached to or detached from an instance in a running state.


 
 
170
##Storage
-------------------------------------------------
Instance-attached storage:
	• EBS: scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
	• Instance Store: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
Network storage:
	• Amazon S3: large blob, not a file system
	• Amazon EFS: scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
	• Amazon FSx for Lustre:
		• HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS
		• Backed by S3 




171
##Automation and Orchestration
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Batch
	• AWS Batch supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables you to run single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances.
	• Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly

AWS ParallelCluster
	• Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
	• Configure with text files
	• Automate creation of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instance types
	• Ability to enable EFA on the cluster (improves network performance)

172
##CloudFormation
-------------------------------------------------
An AWS CloudFormation template is a formatted text file in JSON or YAML language 
that describes your AWS infrastructure. 


Format version: Format version defines the capability of a template.
Description: Any comments about your template.
Metadata: Metadata can be used in the template to provide further information. 

CloudFormation Building Blocks:
Templates components
	1. Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template (MANDATORY)
	2. Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
	3. Mappings: the static variables for your template
	4. Outputs: References to what has been created
	5. Conditionals: List of conditions to perform resource creation
	6. Metadata
Templates helpers:
	1. References
	2. Functions

HowToWork:
-Create or use an existing CloudFormation template using JSON or YAML format.
-Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
-Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template. 
-CloudFormation reads the file and understands the services that are called, their order, 
 the relationship between the services, and provisions the services one after the other.


For example,you say:
	• I want a security group
	• I want two EC2 machines using this security group
	• I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
	• I want an S3 bucket
	• I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines


Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (1/2):
Infrastructure as code:
	• No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
	• The code can be version controlled for example using git
	• Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code

Cost:
	• Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
	• You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
	• Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely


• Productivity
	• Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
	• Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
	• Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
• Don’t re-invent the wheel
	• Leverage existing templates on the web!
	• Leverage the documentation
• Supports (almost) all AWS resources:
	• Everything we’ll see in this course is supported
	• You can use “custom resources” for resources that are not supported


CloudFormation Stack Designer:
	• We can see all the resources 
	• We can see the relations between the components




How CloudFormation Works:
• Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
• To update a template, we can’t edit previous ones. 
  We have to reupload a new version of the template to AWS.
• Stacks are identified by a name
• Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by CloudFormation.


Deploying CloudFormation templates:
Manual way:
	• Editing templates in the CloudFormation Designer
	• Using the console to input parameters, etc
Automated way:
	• Editing templates in a YAML file
	• Using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) to deploy the templates
	• Recommended way when you fully want to automate your flow

CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).

CloudFormation Stack Designer:
	• We can see all the resources .
	• We can see the relations between the components.


UseCase:
========
Manage infrastructure with DevOps
Automate, test, and deploy infrastructure templates with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) automations.
Scale production stacks
Run anything from a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance to a complex multi-region application.

175
##SSM Systems Manager – SSM Session Manager
-------------------------------------------------
Parameter Store allows you to create key-value parameters to save your application configurations, custom environment variables, 
product keys, and credentials on a single interface. 
Parameter Store allows you to secure your data by encryption which is integrated with AWS KMS.

AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is a new interactive shell and CLI that helps to provide secure, 
access-controlled, and audited Windows and Linux EC2 instance management. 

Session Manager removes the need to open inbound ports, manage SSH keys, or use bastion hosts.

Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on-premises servers
• No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
• No port 22 needed (better security)
• Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
• Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch Logs
Install the SSM Agent IF not already installed.



From (on-premises servers, EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.) sends a parameter request to SSM Parameter Store:
Then: 
	For plaintext check IAM if the user/role is allowed to retrieve the parameter.
    For encrypted check IAM if the user/role is allowed to retrieve and decrypt the parameter.

SecureString :
Fortunately, there’s no real effort to decrypting the variables. No keys to store or additional processing that needs to 
be done manually. To fetch the SecureString type parameters and have them decrypted along the way, 
simply include the WithDecryption property:




 
AWS Secrets Manager:
	AWS Secrets Manager enables you to rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, 
	API keys and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. 
	It also makes it really easy for you to follow security best practices such as 
	encrypting secrets and rotating these regularly. 

If you are a security administrator responsible for storing and managing secrets, 
and ensuring that your organization follows regulatory and compliance requirements, 
you can use Secrets Manager.

##END
=================================================
@@@Proceed by elimination
=================================================
=================================================
• Most questions are going to be scenario based
• For all the questions, rule out answers that you know for sure are wrong
• For the remaining answers, understand which one makes the most sense
• There are very few trick questions
• Don’t over-think it
• If a solution seems feasible but highly complicated, it’s probably wrong














181
##VPC Reachability Analyzer
-------------------------------------------------
VPC Reachability Analyzer to determine whether a destination resource in your 
virtual private cloud (VPC) is reachable from a source resource. 

It builds a model of the network configuration, then checks the reachability based on 
these configurations (it doesn’t send packets).


UseCase:
========
Troubleshoot connectivity issues,ensure network configuration is as intended.


BillCost:
=========
You are charged per analysis run between a source and destination.




182
##DNS Resolution
-------------------------------------------------
DNS Resolution (enableDnsSupport)
• Decides if DNS resolution from Route53 Resolver server is supported for the VPC
• True (default): it queries the Amazon Provider DNS Server at 169.254.169.253 or the
reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two (.2)

DNS Hostnames (enableDnsHostnames)
• By default,
• True => default VPC
• False => newly created VPCs
• Won’t do anything unless enableDnsSupport=true
• If True, assigns public hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public IPv4

If you use custom DNS domain names in a Private Hosted Zone in
Route53, you must set both these attributes (enableDnsSupport & enableDnsHostname) to true





183
##Route53 Private Zones
-------------------------------------------------
A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want  Route53 to respond to
DNS queries for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs that you create with the  VPC service.

You create a private hosted zone, such as example.com, and specify the VPCs that you want to associate with the hosted zone.
Managing hosted zones: You pay a monthly charge for each hosted zone managed with Route53.





184
#Data Warehouse
-------------------------------------------------
A data warehouse is a specialized type of relational database, which is optimized for
analysis and reporting of large amounts of data. It can be used to combine
transactional data from disparate sources.

Traditionally, setting up, running, and scaling a data warehouse has been complicated
and expensive. 
On AWS, you can leverage Amazon Redshift, a managed data
warehouse service that is designed to operate at less than a tenth the cost of
traditional solutions.

AWS STS is  to request temporary security credentials for your AWS resources, 
for IAM authenticated users and users that are authenticated in AWS such as federated users via OpenID or SAML2.0.


AWS STS – Security Token Service:
• Allows to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources.
• AssumeRole
• Cross Account Access: assume role in target account to perform actions there
• AssumeRoleWithSAML
• AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
• return creds for users logged with an IdP (Facebook Login, Google Login, OIDC compatible…)
• GetSessionToken
• Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour




Identity Federation in AWS:
• Federation lets users outside of AWS to assume temporary role for accessing AWS resources.
• These users assume identity provided access role.
Federations can have many flavors:
	• SAML 2.0
	• Custom Identity Broker
	• Web Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito
	• Web Identity Federation without Amazon Cognito
	• Single Sign On
	• Non-SAML with AWS Microsoft AD
Using federation, you don’t need to create IAM users (user management is outside of AWS)


ExamTips: Any time you see AssumeRole or Cross account access, its STS.


AWS STS supports open standards like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, 
with which you can use Microsoft AD FS to leverage your Microsoft Active Directory. 
You can also use SAML 2.0 to manage your own solution for federating user identities.

##GraphQL:
------------------------------------------------
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. 
GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they 
control the data they get, not the server.






207
##AppSync (GraphQL API)
-------------------------------------------------
What is AWS AppSync?
The fundamental idea of a GraphQL API is that all API functionality is available via a 
unified query language (the Graph Query Language) under a single endpoint. 


AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications.
AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs simplify application development by providing a single endpoint to securely 
query or update data from multiple databases, microservices, and APIs.


GraphQL APIs built with AWS AppSync give front-end developers the ability 
        to query multiple databases, microservices, and APIs from a single GraphQL endpoint. 
Pub/Sub APIs built with AWS AppSync give front-end developers the ability 
        to publish real-time data updates to subscribed API clients via serverless WebSockets connections.

AWS AppSync SDKs support iOS, Android, and JavaScript. 

Store and sync data across mobile and web apps in real-time

##BGP |   Border Gateway Protocol          
-------------------------------------------------
BGP is a means by which all junction points on the internet (routers) communicate with each other to dynamically establish the 
correct (and correctly weighted) paths that network packets should follow to traverse the global networking



210
##AWS Policy Simulator | IAM
-------------------------------------------------
The AWS IAM Simulator is a tool that helps you to test the effects of IAM access control policies. 
This tool helps when you find yourself manually performing actions to test a policy. 
The IAM simulator can simulate actions for any IAM principal, resource, and policy conditions.

The simulator does not make an actual AWS service request, so you can safely test 
requests that might make unwanted changes to your live AWS environment.




212
##ECMP
-------------------------------------------------
Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) is a routing strategy where packet forwarding to a single destination can occur over 
multiple best paths with equal routing priority.

=================================================
##Section 4: IAM & AWS CLI        
================================================= 

#IAM | User | Group | Policy
-------------------------------------------------
IAM is a global AWS services that is not limited by regions. 
Any user, group, role or policy is accessible globally.

AWS IAM is also called AWS Identity and Access Management.
It helps you securely manage AWS resources and services.
IAM user represents an entity (person or an application) that interacts with AWS resources and services.


IAM Entities:
-------------
-Users - any individual end user such as an employee, system architect, CTO, etc.
-Groups - any collection of similar people with shared permissions such as system administrators, HR employees, finance teams, etc. 
 Each user within their specified group will inherit the permissions set for the group.
-Roles - any software service that needs to be granted permissions to do its job, 
 e.g- AWS Lambda needing write permissions to S3 or a fleet of EC2 instances needing read permissions from a RDS MySQL database.
-Policies - the documented rule sets that are applied to grant or limit access. 
 In order for users, groups, or roles to properly set permissions, they use policies. 
 Policies are written in JSON and you can either use custom policies for your specific needs or use the default policies set by AWS.


IAM features are:
    AWS account root user
	IAM Users
	IAM policy
	IAM groups
	IAM roles
	Multi-factor authentication
	

User can access AWS Three way:
-AwS Management Console
-AWS Command Line Interface(CLI)
-AWS Softeare Developer Kit (SDK)
Also CloudShell like CLI	


ConfigCLI:
==========
Download/Install CLI Software you Operstion system
=>aws --version
=>aws configure
Then Enter access ID and Key
=>aws iam list-users


CloudShell:
AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that gives you command-line access to your AWS resources in the selected AWS region. 
AWS CloudShell comes pre-installed with popular tools for resource management and creation.


IAM Role:
Some aws service will need to perform action on your behalf, to do so, we will\
assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.



IAM Security Tools:
==================
• IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
-A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

• IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
-Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
-You can use this information to revise your policies.



IAM Guidelines & Best Practices:
• Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
• One physical user = One AWS user
• Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
• Create a strong password policy
• Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
• Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
• Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
• Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report



IAM Section – Summary:
• Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
• Groups: contains users only
• Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
• Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
• Security: MFA + Password Policy
• Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
• Audit: IAM Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor


Golden AMI is an image that contains all your software, dependencies, and configurations, so that future 
EC2 instances can boot up quickly from that AMI.



=================================================
##Section 5: EC2 Fundamentals
=================================================
Ec2=> Elastic Compute Cloud (Infrastructure as a Service on AWS)
EC2 provides virtual computing environments called “instances.”
Copy of EC2 instances: Old instance -> Snapshot -> Image (AMI) -> New instance


The following EC2-related resources don't generate charges when used or provisioned to an account:
-Virtual private clouds (VPCs)
-Security groups
-Key pairs
-Elastic network interfaces
-Auto Scaling groups


IAM Roles are the right way to provide credentials and permissions to an EC2 instance.


#EC2    
-------------------------------------------------
t2.micro:
	t - Instance Family
	2 - generation. Improvements with each generation.
	micro - size. (nano < micro < small < medium < large < xlarge < …..)


EC2 provides two important services to get details:
-Instance Metadata Service
-Dynamic Data Service

MetadataURL: 
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document


#AWS EC2 Instance Metadata
-------------------------------------------------
AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is powerful but one of the least known features to developers
• It allows AWS EC2 instances to ”learn about themselves” without using an IAM Role for that purpose.
• The URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
• You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you CANNOT retrieve the IAM Policy.
• Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
• Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instance
• Let’s practice and see what we can do with it!


#Bootstrapping: 
-------------------------------------------------
Install OS patches or software when an EC2 instance is launched.
def-sub-south-1a

Example:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document > /var/www/html/index.html
You can call http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/ from inside the EC2 instance to lookup user data configured for that instance.

http://3.110.83.133/home.html

#Security Groups:
-------------------------------------------------
Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances 
They regulate: 
• Access to Ports 
• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Security Groups can be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same AWS Region/VPC.


-Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
-They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
-Security groups only contain allow rules
-Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group



General Ports:
22    = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
21    = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
22    = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
80    = HTTP – access unsecured websites
443   = HTTPS – access secured websites
3389  = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance


Key Pairs:
-Public key cryptography (Key Pairs) used to protect your EC2 instances
-You need private key with right permissions (chmod 400) to connect to your EC2 instance. 
(Windows EC2 instances only) You need admin password also.
-Security group should allow SSH(22) or RDP(3389)


SSH:
-------------------------------------------------

Windows PowerShell:
Go to .pem file directory then
=>ssh -i .\MyKeFile.pem ec2-user@ec2PublicIP


=>whoami
=>ping google.com


#EC2 Tenancy - Shared vs Dedicated
--------------------------------------------------

There are two Dedicated EC2 options:
-EC2 Dedicated Instances
-EC2 Dedicated Hosts


EC2 Dedicated Instances are Virtualized instances on hardware dedicated to one customer:
You do NOT have visibility into the hardware of underlying host

EC2 Dedicated Hosts are Physical servers dedicated to one customer:
You have visibility into the hardware of underlying host (sockets and physical cores)
(Use cases) Regulatory needs or server-bound software licenses like Windows Server, SQL Server


#EC2 Pricing Models:
--------------------------------------------------
-On Demand: Request when you want it	Flexible and Most Expensive
-Spot: Quote the maximum price	Cheapest (upto 90% off) BUT NO Guarantees
-Reserved: Reserve ahead of time	Upto 75% off. 1 or 3 years reservation.
-Savings Plans: Commit spending $X per hour on (EC2 or AWS Fargate or Lambda)	Upto 66% off. No restrictions. 1 or 3 years reservation.


Compute Optimized:
Compute Optimized EC2 instances are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high-performance 
processors (e.g., batch processing, media transcoding, high-performance computing, scientific modeling & 
machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers).


Memory Optimized:
Memory Optimized EC2 instances are great for workloads requiring large data sets in memory.


Storage Optimized:
Storage Optimized EC2 instances are great for workloads requiring high, sequential read/write access to large data sets on local storage.


Dedicated Hosts:
Dedicated Hosts are good for companies with strong compliance needs or for software that have complicated licensing models. 
This is the most expensive EC2 Purchasing Option available.


#Monitoring EC2 instances
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon CloudWatch is used to monitor EC2 instances.

There are two types of monitoring:
(FREE) Basic monitoring (“Every 5 minutes”) provided for all EC2 instance types
(\(\)) EC2 Detailed Monitoring can be enabled for detailed metrics every 1 minute


VM Import/Export:
VM Import/Export enables you to easily import virtual machine images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances. 
This service allows you to leverage your existing investments in the virtual machines that you have built to meet your IT security, 
configuration management, and compliance requirements by bringing those virtual machines into Amazon EC2 as ready-to-use instances. 
If you are planning to use your own Microsoft licenses, use the ImportImage tool made available by the 
VM Import/Export service to import your own Microsoft media.
The VM Import/Export service is available at no additional charge beyond standard usage charges for Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.


Termination Protection:
Remember:EC2 Termination Protection is not effective for terminations from a) Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) b) Spot Instances c) OS Shutdown
Launch Templates - Pre-configured templates (AMI ID, instance type, and network settings) simplifying the creation of EC2 instances.


INP:
====
-You want to update the EC2 instance to a new AMI updated with latest patches
Relaunch a new instance with an updated AMI

-Create EC2 instances based on on-premise Virtual Machine (VM) images	
Use VM Import/Export. You are responsible for licenses.


-You are installing a lot of software using user data slowing down instance launch. How to make it faster?	
Create an AMI from the EC2 instance and use it for launching new instances

-I’ve stopped my EC2 instance. Will I be billed for it?	
ZERO charge for a stopped instance (If you have storage attached, you have to pay for storage)




=================================================
##Section 6: EC2 - Solutions Architect Associate Level
=================================================
Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-demand Instances. 
It allows you to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price.


#Elastic IP Addresses:
-------------------------------------------------
How do you get a constant public IP address for a EC2 instance? Quick and dirty way is to use an Elastic IP!
An Elastic IP can be switched to another EC2 instance within the same region. Elastic IP remains attached even if you stop the instance. 
You have to manually detach it.



#Placement Group        
-------------------------------------------------

Placement group is a way to impact the placement of interdependent EC2 instance groups in order 
to suit your workload requirements. 
AWS provides three placement strategies which you can use based on the type of your workload.


General rules and limitations:
	You can create a maximum of 500 placement groups per account in each Region.
	You cannot launch Dedicated Hosts in placement groups.




Cluster Placement Groups: 
	A logical grouping of instances within a single AZ.
	A cluster placement group can't span multiple Availability Zones.
	You can launch multiple instance types into a cluster placement group. 
	We recommend using the same instance type for all instances in a cluster placement group.
	Network traffic to the internet and over an AWS Direct Connect connection to on-premises 
	resources is limited to 5 Gbps.


Partition Placement Groups: 
Logical partition of instance groups such that no two partitions within a 
placement group share the same underlying hardware.

A partition placement group supports a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone. 
The number of instances that you can launch in a partition placement group is limited 
only by your account limits.
	Amazon EC2 doesn’t guarantee an even distribution of instances across all partitions.
	A partition placement group with Dedicated Instances can have a maximum of two partitions.
	You can't use Capacity Reservations to reserve capacity in a partition placement group.


Spread Placement Groups: 
each instance within a spread placement group will be placed in a different rack.
	A rack spread placement group supports a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone.
For example, in a Region with three Availability Zones, you can run a total of 21 instances in 
the group, with seven instances in each Availability Zone.
	Spread placement groups are not supported for Dedicated Instances.
	You can't use Capacity Reservations to reserve capacity in a spread placement group.

Host level spread placement groups are only supported for placement groups on AWS Outposts. 
There are no restrictions for the number of running instances with host level spread placement groups.


Cluster Placement Group:
	Recommended for low network latency, and/or high network throughput applications.
	Only specific to a single AZ
	Can span peered VPCs in the same Region
It usually supports up to 10Gbps network.
problem with cluster placement groups is if the rack fails, all the instances will fail at the same time 
compromising the high availability of the application.
  
  


Partition Placement Group:
 Each logical partition is composed of multiple instances. The partition placement group option allows 
 you to place those partitions within a single AZ or in a multi-AZ setup within the same region.

for large distributed and replicated workloads such as kafka, hadoop and cassandra etc.
	Reduces the impact of correlated hardware failures for your application
	Mainly used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as 
	HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks.
	Can have partitions in multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.



Spread Placement Group:
If you deploy five instances and put them into this type of placement group, each one of 
those five instances will reside on a different rack with its own network access and power, 
either within a single AZ or in multi-AZ architecture.

You can create up to 7 EC2 instances per availability zone per spread placement group. 
Spread placement groups are designed for applications that require maximum high availability and where 
each instance must be isolated from failure from each other.

Recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be 
kept separate from each other.
Can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.




#ENI |  Elastic network interfaces             
-------------------------------------------------
An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. 
Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) are bounded to a specific AZ. You can not attach an ENI to an EC2 instance in a different AZ.
ENIs have security groups, just like EC2 instances, which act as a built in firewall.


It can include the following attributes:
A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
One public IPv4 address
One or more IPv6 addresses
One or more security groups
A MAC address
A source/destination check flag
A description

ENIs are virtual network cards you can attach to your EC2 instances. They are used to enable network connectivity for your instances, 
and having more than one of them connected to your instance allows it to communicate on two different subnets.


A common use case for ENIs is the creation of management networks. 
This allows you to have public-facing applications like web servers in a public subnet but lock down SSH access 
down to a private subnet on a secondary network interface. In this scenario, you would connect using a 
VPN to the private management subnet, then administrate your servers as usual.



Each EC2 instance is connected to primary network interface (eth0). 
You can create and attach a secondary network interface - eth1.

This allows an instance to be dual homed - present in two subnets in a VPC. 
It can be used to create a management network or a low budget high availability solution.


Important terminology with ENI:
Hot attach: Attaching ENI when EC2 instance is running
Warm attach: Attaching ENI when EC2 instance is stopped
Cold attach: Attaching ENI at launch time of EC2 instance


ENI make you more control over the provate network, and IP.


EC2 Hibernate:
For enable EC2 Hibernation root ebs volume must be encrypted and must enought size to fit RAM in Root EBS.
To enable EC2 Hibernate, the EC2 Instance Root Volume type must be an EBS volume and must be encrypted to ensure the 
protection of sensitive content.


EC2 Nitro:
• Underlying Platform for the next generation of EC2 instances
• New virtualization technology
• Allows for better performance:
• Better networking options (enhanced networking, HPC, IPv6)
• Higher Speed EBS (Nitro is necessary for 64,000 EBS IOPS – max 32,000 on non-Nitro)
• Better underlying security
• Instance types example:
• Virtualized:A1, C5,C6gn, D3, G4, I3en, Inf1, M5,M5a,M5n.
• Bare metal: a1.metal, c5.metal, c5d.metal, c5n.metal, c6g.metal, c6gd.metal.



#EC2 capacity reservation:
-------------------------------------------------
Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. 
This gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. 
By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, 
for as long as you need it. 

You must reserve the instance only for 1 or 3 years, not any time in between.



=================================================
##Section 7: EC2 Instance Storage
=================================================

The OS provides access to block-level storage via open, write, and read system calls.

The simplified flow of a read request goes like this:
-An application wants to read the file /path/to/file.txt and makes a read system call.
-The OS forwards the read request to the file system.
-The file system translates /path/to/file.txt to the block on the disk where the data is stored.


#Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
-------------------------------------------------
AWS provides two kinds of block-level storage: network-attached storage (NAS) and instance storage. 
NAS is (like iSCSI) attached to your EC2 instance via a network connection, whereas instance storage is a normal hard 
disk that the host system provides to your EC2 instance. 

You can use block-level storage only in combination with an EC2 instance where the OS runs.
The OS provides access to block-level storage via open, write, and read system calls.

Aren’t part of your EC2 instances; they’re attached to your EC2 instance via a network connection. 
If you terminate your EC2 instance, the EBS volumes remain.

EBS Volumes are created for a specific AZ. It is possible to migrate them between different AZs using EBS Snapshots.

What’s an EBS Volume?
• An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach
to your instances while they run
• It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
• They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
• They are bound to a specific availability zone
• Analogy: Think of them as a “network USB stick”
• Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or
Magnetic per month


 - One EBS for one EC2
 - EBS Volume locked at the AZ level, EC2 and EBS have to be same zone to attach.
 - Make shapshots to sent data volum to AZ or region.
 - Using EBS Multi-Attach, you can attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ (with Full rw).
 - EBS Multi-Attach volume can be attached to multiple EC2 instances

When creating EC2 instances, you can only use the following EBS volume types as boot volumes: gp2, gp3, io1, io2, and Magnetic (Standard).
Using EBS Multi-Attach, you can attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ. 
Each EC2 instance has full read/write permissions.


#Instance stores:
-------------------------------------------------
An instance store provides block-level storage like a normal hard disk. Instance store is part of an EC2 instance and available only 
if your instance is running; it won’t persist your data if you stop or terminate the instance. Therefore you don’t pay 
separately for an instance store; instance store charges are included in the EC2 instance price.

64,000 is the maximum IOPS you can achieve when you're using EBS io1 or io2 volume types.


You are running a high-performance database that requires an IOPS of 310,000 for its underlying storage. What do you recommend?
You can run a database on an EC2 instance that uses an Instance Store, but you'll have a problem that the data will be lost if the 
EC2 instance is stopped (it can be restarted without problems). 
One solution is that you can set up a replication mechanism on another EC2 instance with an Instance Store to have a standby copy. 
Another solution is to set up backup mechanisms for your data. 
It's all up to you how you want to set up your architecture to validate your requirements. 
In this use case, it's around IOPS, so we have to choose an EC2 Instance Store.

 
Spot Instances:
===============
Spot instances are cost-effective when you can be flexible with your application’s availability and when your 
applications can be interrupted after a two-minute warning notification. 

Spot instances are ideal for stateless, error-tolerant, or flexible applications like data analysis, batch jobs, 
background processing, and optional tasks.

A Spot Price is the hourly rate for a Spot instance. 


There are two types of spot requests:
-A one-time spot request stays active until Amazon EC2 runs the spot instance, you cancel the request, or it expires. 
If the spot price goes above your bid or capacity is unavailable, Amazon terminates the spot instance and closes the spot request.

-A persistent spot instance request stays active until you cancel it or until it expires—even if Amazon carried out the request. 
If the spot price goes above your bid or capacity becomes unavailable, the spot instance is interrupted. 
Amazon keeps the request open, and if conditions change and a spot instance does become available, it starts or 
resumes the spot instance



#AMI  | Amazon Machine Image
-------------------------------------------------
You need to choose the Amazon Machine Image or AMI based on what operating system and what software do you want on the EC2 instance.
AMIs are stored in Amazon S3 (region specific).

AMIs are built for a specific AWS Region, they're unique for each AWS Region. You can't launch an EC2 instance using an 
AMI in another AWS Region, but you can copy the AMI to the target AWS Region and then use it to create your EC2 instances.


AMIs contain:
-Root volume block storage (OS and applications)
-Block device mappings for non-root volumes
-You can configure launch permissions on an AMI

Who can use the AMI?
You can share your AMIs with other AWS accounts

Best Practice: Backup upto date AMIs in multiple regions
Critical for Disaster Recovery


Three AMI sources:
-Provided by AWS
-AWS Market Place: Online store for customized AMIs. Per hour billing
-Customized AMIs: Created by you.


AMI Process (from an EC2 instance):
• Start an EC2 instance and customize it
• Stop the instance (for data integrity)
• Build an AMI – this will also create EBS snapshots
• Launch instances from other AMIs


EC2 Instance Store:
Instance store volumes, unlike EBS volumes, cannot be detached or attached to another instance


• EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
• If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
• Better I/O performance
• EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)
• Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
• Risk of data loss if hardware fails
• Backups and Replication are your responsibility


EBS Multi-Attach – io1/io2 family:
Only io1/io2 family can have multi-attach.
Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ.
Each instance has full read & write permissions to the volume.



#EFS – Elastic File System
-------------------------------------------------
AWS Elastic File System (EFS) is one of three main storage services offered by Amazon. 
It is a scalable, cloud-based file system for Linux-based applications and workloads that can be used in combination with 
AWS cloud services and on-premise resources. 
EFS offers a choice between two storage classes, Infrequent Access and Standard access.

EFS is a network file system (NFS) that allows you to mount the same file system on EC2 instances that are in different AZs.
• Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
• EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ



EFS – Performance & Storage Classes:
EFS Scale
• 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput
• Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically

Performance mode (set at EFS creation time)
• General purpose (default): latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc…)
• Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)

Throughput mode
• Bursting (1 TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s)
• Provisioned: set your throughput regardless of storage size, ex: 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage

Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature – move file after N days) 
• Standard: for frequently accessed files 
• Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. 
Enable EFS -IA with a Lifecycle Policy.

Availability and durability 
• Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod 
• One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone -IA)


EBS vs EFS:
-EBS have to pay for provisioning the Size and have to pay full capicity not the uses.
-EFS you do bill only what you used.


EFS multi AZ network file system for multiple EC2
EBS Single AZ single EC2
Instance Storage for single EC2 High permormance and Maximam I/O.


AWS S3:
Simple Storage Service (S3) provides object storage, without the use of EC2 instances, that is accessible directly through the internet.



=================================================
Section 8: High Availability and Scalability: ELB & ASG
=================================================
High Availability: 
Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
• Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
• Load Balancer multi AZ


The following cookie names are reserved by the ELB (AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG).


Load Balances:
Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple
servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream

It is integrated with many AWS offerings/services:
• EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
• AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
• Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator



AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers:

• Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) – 2009 – CLB
HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)

• Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2016 – ALB
HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket

• Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2017 – NLB
TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP

• Gateway Load Balancer – 2020 – GWLB
Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) – IP Protocol

Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they
provide more features
Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs



Application Load Balancer (v2):
-------------------------------------------------

ALBs can route traffic to different Target Groups based on URL Path, Hostname, HTTP Headers, and Query Strings.
You can't attach an Elastic IP address to Application Load Balancers.

• Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
• Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines
(target groups)
• Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine
(ex: containers)
• Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
• Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)
 Routing tables to different target groups:
• Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
• Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
• Routing based on Query String, Headers
(example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
• ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
• Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
• In comparison, we’d need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application

• ALB can route to multiple target groups
• Health checks are at the target group level

Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
• The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
• We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)



#Network Load Balancer (v2):
-------------------------------------------------
Network Load Balancer has one static IP address per AZ and you can attach an Elastic IP address to it. 
Application Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers have a static DNS name.
NLB has fixed IP, one fixep for per AZ.

• Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
• Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
• Handle millions of request per seconds
• Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
• NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP
  (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
• NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
• Not included in the AWS free tier



Network Load Balancer –Target Groups:
• EC2 instances
• IP Addresses – must be private IPs
• Application Load Balancer




#Gateway Load Balancer
-------------------------------------------------
• Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
• Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection
Systems, payload manipulation


Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) – IPPackets, Combines the following functions:
• Transparent Network Gateway – single entry/exit for all traffic
• Load Balancer – distributes traffic to your virtual appliances
• Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081



Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity):
-------------------------------------------------
• It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
• This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers
• The “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
• Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data




Cross-Zone Load Balancing:
-------------------------------------------------
When Cross-Zone Load Balancing is enabled, ELB distributes traffic evenly across all registered EC2 instances in all AZs.

Application Load Balancer 
• Always on (can’t be disabled) 
• No charges for inter AZ data 

Network Load Balancer 
• Disabled by default 
• You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled 

Classic Load Balancer 
• Disabled by default 
• No charges for inter AZ data if enabled


Sticky Sessions – Cookie Names
• Application-based Cookies
• Custom cookie
• Generated by the target
• Can include any custom attributes required by the application
• Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
• Don’t use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
• Application cookie
• Generated by the load balancer
• Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
• Duration-based Cookies
• Cookie generated by the load balancer
• Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB



Elastic Load Balancers – SSL Certificates:
-------------------------------------------------
Classic Load Balancer (v1)
• Support only one SSL certificate
• Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates

Application Load Balancer (v2)
• Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
• Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work

Network Load Balancer (v2)
• Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
• Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work


Connection Draining
-------------------------------------------------
Feature naming
• Connection Draining – for CLB
• Deregistration Delay – for ALB & NLB

• Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
• Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
• Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds)
• Can be disabled (set value to 0)
• Set to a low value if your requests are short


Auto Scaling Group Attributes
-------------------------------------------------

A Launch Template (older “Launch Configurations” are deprecated)
• AMI + Instance Type
• EC2 User Data
• EBS Volumes
• Security Groups
• SSH Key Pair
• IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances
• Network + Subnets Information
• Load Balancer Information
• Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
• Scaling Policies

It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric)



Auto Scaling Groups – Dynamic Scaling Policies
• Target Tracking Scaling
• Most simple and easy to set-up
• Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
• Simple / Step Scaling
• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
• Scheduled Actions
• Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
• Example: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays


VIP:
===
Only Network Load Balancer provides both static DNS name and static IP. 
While, Application Load Balancer provides a static DNS name but it does NOT provide a static IP. 
The reason being that AWS wants your Elastic Load Balancer to be accessible using a static endpoint, 
even if the underlying infrastructure that AWS manages changes.


Which feature in both Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers allows you to load multiple 
SSL certificates on one listener?
Server Name Indication (SNI)

Server Name Indication (SNI) allows you to expose multiple HTTPS applications each with its own 
SSL certificate on the same listener. 

Make sure you remember the Default Termination Policy for Auto Scaling Group. 
It tries to balance across AZs first, then terminates based on the age of the Launch Configuration.



=================================================
#Elastic Load Blancer |  | elb | ELB          
=================================================
Elastic Load Balancer are used to distribute traffic across EC2 instances in one or more AZs in a single region. 

The AWS ELB is an AWS service for automatic distribution of incoming application traffic across its components 
like Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, and containers..

A load balancer accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to its registered targets (such as EC2) in one or more AZ. 
The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets.
When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target. 
It then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.

TypeOfLoadBalancer:
 - Application Load Balancers
 - Network Load Balancers
 - Gateway Load Balancers
 - Classic Load Balancers
 
Load balancers are a regional service. They do not balance load across different regions. 
You must provision a new ELB in each region that you operate out of.


With Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, 
you register targets in target groups, and route traffic to the target groups. 
With Classic Load Balancers,you register instances with the load balancer.


Cross-zone load balancing is enable then every target equal load, if disable the  every AZ are equal. 
Application Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled.
With Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. 


Elastic Load Balancing works with the following services:

 - Amazon EC2 — Virtual servers that run your applications in the cloud. 
 - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling — Ensures that you are running your desired number of instances, even if an instance fails. 
 - AWS Certificate Manager — When you create an HTTPS listener, you can specify certificates provided by ACM. The load balancer uses certificates to terminate connections and decrypt requests from clients.
 - Amazon CloudWatch — Enables you to monitor your load balancer and to take action as needed. 
 - Amazon ECS — Enables you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. 
 - AWS Global Accelerator — Improves the availability and performance of your application. Use an accelerator to distribute traffic across multiple load balancers in one or more AWS Regions.
 - Route 53 — Provides a reliable and cost-effective way to route visitors to websites by translating domain names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other.
 - AWS WAF — You can use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web access control list (web ACL).

 
#AWS Classic Load Balancer:
------------------------------------------------- 
This simple load balancer operates both at the request level and the connection level and was originally used for classic EC2 instances. 
Classic Load balancer in AWS is used on EC2-classic instances. This is the previous generation’s load balancer and also it doesn’t allow host-based or path based routing.
Mostly it is used to route traffic to one single URL.


#NLB
------------------------------------------------- 
AWS recommends AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) if the application needs to achieve static IP and extreme performance.
AWS network load balancers also avoid DNS caching problems and work with existing firewall security policies of users thanks to its static and resilient IP addresses. 
And AWS load balancer TLS termination is only possible with NLB.


#Create a ELB
------------------------------------------------- 
Select which type of AWS load balancer to use
Complete basic configuration
Configure a security group
Configure a target group
Register targets
Create a load balancer and test it
Get more details on how to configure AWS load balancers


#GateWay Load Balancer
-------------------------------------------------
Gateway Load Balancer helps you easily deploy, scale, and manage your third-party virtual appliances. 
It gives you one gateway for distributing traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up or down, 
based on demand. This decreases potential points of failure in your network and increases availability.

You can find, test, and buy virtual appliances from third-party vendors directly in AWS Marketplace.  

Use cases:
Centralize your third-party virtual appliances
Consolidating your third-party virtual appliances with Gateway Load Balancer can reduce operational overhead and costs.



=================================================
#ASG Auto Scaling | Auto Scaling groups        
================================================= 
An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a 
logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. 
An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies.

When you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group, you must specify a launch configuration. You can specify your launch configuration with multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups. 

AutoScaling happend in a available zone.


Component of Authscaling

You cannot modify a launch configuration after you've created it. If you want to change the launch 
configuration for an Auto Scaling group, you must create a new launch configuration and update your Auto Scaling group to 
inherit this new launch configuration.

The default termination policy for an Auto Scaling Group is to automatically terminate a stopped instance, 
so unless you've configured it to do otherwise, stopping an instance will result in termination regardless 
if you wanted that to happen or not. 
A new instance will be spun up in its place.
 
 

#Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling vs. AWS Auto Scaling           
--------------------------------------------------
AWS Auto Scaling:
You should use AWS Auto Scaling to manage scaling for multiple resources across multiple services. 
AWS Auto Scaling lets you define dynamic scaling policies for multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups or other resources using predefined scaling strategies. Using AWS Auto Scaling to configure scaling policies for all of the scalable resources 
in your application is faster than managing scaling policies for each resource via its individual service console

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling :
You should use EC2 Auto Scaling if you only need to scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you are only interested 
in maintaining the health of your EC2 fleet. You should also use EC2 Auto Scaling if you need 
to create or configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you need to set up scheduled or step 
scaling policies (as AWS Auto Scaling supports only target tracking scaling policies)


Predictive Scaling of AWS Auto Scaling pla:
Predictive Scaling Policy brings the similar prediction algorithm offered through AWS Auto Scaling 
plan as a native scaling policy in EC2 Auto Scaling. 
If you have predictable load changes, you can use Predictive Scaling policy to proactively increase capacity ahead of upcoming demand. 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to run your Amazon EC2 fleet at optimal utilization.


What is fleet management and how is it different from dynamic scaling:

Fleet management refers to the functionality that automatically replaces unhealthy instances and maintains your fleet at the 
desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling fleet management ensures that your application is able to receive traffic 
and that the instances themselves are working properly. 
When Auto Scaling detects a failed health check, it can replace the instance automatically.


The dynamic scaling capabilities of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling refers to the functionality that automatically increases 
or decreases capacity based on load or other metrics. For example, if your CPU spikes above 80% (and you have an alarm setup)
 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can add a new instance dynamically.



================================================= 
##Section 9: AWS Fundamentals: RDS + Aurora + ElastiCache
================================================= 
RDS is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in AWS. 
It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating or outsourcing time-consuming administration tasks such as 
hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.

RDS comes in six different flavors:
SQL Server
Oracle
MySQL Server
PostgreSQL
MariaDB
Aurora


RDS has two key features when scaling out:
-Read replication for improved performance
-Multi-AZ for high availability


You cannot SSH into an RDS instance so therefore you cannot patch the OS. 
This means that AWS is responsible for the security and maintenance of RDS. 

You can provision an EC2 instance as a database if you need or want to manage the underlying server yourself, 
but not with an RDS engine.

Multi-AZ is supported for all DB flavors except aurora. This is because Aurora is completely fault-tolerant on its own.
Multi-AZ feature allows for high availability across availability zones and not regions.

During a failover, the recovered former primary becomes the new secondary and the promoted secondary becomes primary. 
Once the original DB is recovered, there will be a sync process kicked off where the two 
DBs mirror each other once to sync up on the new data that the failed former primary might have missed out on.



Read Replication is exclusively used for performance enhancement.

You can promote read replicas to be their very own production database if needed.
Read replicas are supported for all six flavors of DB on top of RDS.
Each Read Replica will have its own DNS endpoint.
Automated backups must be enabled in order to use read replicas.



RDS supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

IAM Auth is not supported for ElastiCache Redis. It works with both RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL.
For your RDS database, you can have up to 5 Read Replicas.
You can not create encrypted Read Replicas from an unencrypted RDS DB instance.


RDS is a managed service:
• Automated provisioning, OS patching
• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
• Monitoring dashboards
• Read replicas for improved read performance
• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
• Maintenance windows for upgrades
• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
• BUT you can’t SSH into your instances


Backups are automatically enabled in RDS,Automated backups:

• Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
• Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
• => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
• 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)



ReadReplica:
----------------------------------------------

Up to 5 Read Replicas
• Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
• Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent (My Old data found some time)

Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements(not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Multi-AZ keeps the same connection string regardless of which database is up.
Read Replicas add new endpoints with their own DNS name. We need to change our application to reference them individually 
to balance the read load.

Storing Session Data in ElastiCache is a common pattern to ensuring different EC2 instances can retrieve 
your user's state if needed.


Multi AZ:
SYNC replication and One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
• Increase availability
• Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
• No manual intervention in apps
• Not used for scaling
• Multi-AZ replication is free
• Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)
 

RDS – From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ:
• Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
• Just click on “modify” for the database
• The following happens internally:
• A snapshot is taken
• A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
• Synchronization is established between the two databases



RDS Security – Network & IAM
--------------------------------------------
Network Security
• RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
• RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2
  instances) – it controls which IP / security group can communicate with RDS
Access Management
• IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
• Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database
• IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL-compatible


Aurora and RDS Security – Summary
--------------------------------------------
Encryption at rest:
• Is done only when you first create the DB instance
• or: unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted => create DB from snapshot
• Your responsibility:
• Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB’s SG
• In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM
• Creating a database with or without public access
• Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections

AWS responsibility:
• No SSH access
• No manual DB patching
• No manual OS patching
• No way to audit the underlying instance

ElastiCache – Redis vs Memcached
----------------------------------------
REDIS:
• Multi AZ with Auto-Failover
• Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability
• Data Durability using AOF persistence
• Backup and restore features

MEMCACHED:
• Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
• No high availability (replication)
• Non persistent
• No backup and restore
• Multi-threaded architecture


ElastiCache – Cache Security
----------------------------------------
All caches in ElastiCache:
• Do not support IAM authentication
• IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security

Redis AUTH
• You can set a “password/token” when you create a Redis cluster
• This is an extra level of security for your cach (on top of security groups)
• Support SSL in flight encryption

Memcached
• Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)


RDS Backups:
When it comes to RDS, there are two kinds of backups:
-automated backups
-database snapshots

Automated backups allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a retention period (between one and 35 days). 
Automated backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day. 
When you perform a DB recovery, RDS will first choose the most recent daily backup and apply the relevant transaction logs from that day. 


DB snapshots are done manually by the administrator. A key different from automated backups is that they are retained even 
after the original RDS instance is terminated. With automated backups, the backed up data in 
S3 is wiped clean along with the RDS engine. 


A relational database system does not scale well for the following reasons:
It normalizes data and stores it on multiple tables that require multiple queries to write to disk.
It generally incurs the performance costs of an ACID-compliant transaction system.
It uses expensive joins to reassemble required views of query results.


Scenario:
=========
-You want full control of OS or need elevated permissions	Consider going for a custom installation (EC2 + EBS)
-You want to migrate data from an on-premise database to cloud database of the same type	Consider using AWS Database Migration Service
-You want to migrate data from one database engine to another (Example : Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora)	Consider using AWS Schema Conversion Tool
-What are retained when you delete a RDS database instance?	All automatic backups are deleted
-All manual snapshots are retained (until explicit deletion)
(Optional) Take a final snapshot
-How do you reduce global latency and improve disaster recovery?	Use multi region read replicas
-How do you select the subnets a RDS instance is launched into?	Create DB Subnet groups
-How can you add encryption to an unencrypted database instance?	Create a DB snapshot
-Encrypt the database snapshot using keys from KMS
-Create a database from the encrypted snapshot
-Are you billed if you stop your DB instance?	You are billed for storage, IOPS, backups and snapshots. You are NOT billed for DB instance hours
-I will need RDS for at least one year. How can I reduce costs?	Use Amazon RDS reserved instances.
-Efficiently manage database connections	Use Amazon RDS Proxy
-Sits between client applications (including lambdas) and RDS



Let’s add a standby database in the second data center with replication.

Let’s consider some challenges:

Challenge 1 (SOLVED): Your database will go down if the data center crashes
You can switch to the standby database
Challenge 2 (SOLVED): You will lose data if the database crashes
Challenge 3 (SOLVED): Database will be slow when you take snapshots
Take snapshots from standby.
Applications connecting to master will get good performance always




=================================================
##Section 10: Route 53
=================================================
DNS Terminologies:
• Domain Registrar: Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, …
• DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, …
• Zone File: contains DNS records
• Name Server: resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative)
• Top Level Domain (TLD): .com, .us, .in, .gov, .org, …
• Second Level Domain (SLD): amazon.com, google.com


Route 53 – Records:
• How you want to route traffic for a domain
Each record contains:
• Domain/subdomain Name – e.g., example.com
• Record Type – e.g., A or AAAA
• Value – e.g., 12.34.56.78
• Routing Policy – how Route 53 responds to queries
• TTL – amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers

Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
• (must know) A / AAAA / CNAME / NS
• (advanced) CAA / DS / MX / NAPTR / PTR / SOA / TXT / SPF / SRV


Route 53 – Record Types:
• A – maps a hostname to IPv4
• AAAA – maps a hostname to IPv6

CNAME – maps a hostname to another hostname
• The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
• Can’t create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
• Example: you can’t create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com

NS – Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
• Control how traffic is routed for a domain



Route 53 – Alias Records Targets:
--------------------------------------------
• Elastic Load Balancers
• CloudFront Distributions
• API Gateway
• Elastic Beanstalk environments
• S3 Websites
• VPC Interface Endpoints
• Global Accelerator accelerator
• Route 53 record in the same hosted zone
• You cannot set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name


CNAME vs Alias
--------------------------------------------
• AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront...) expose an AWS hostname:
• lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com

CNAME:
• Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
• ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka. something.mydomain.com)

Alias:
• Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
• Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com)
• Free of charge
• Native health check 



Route 53 Routing Policies:
--------------------------------------------
• Define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries 
• Don’t get confused by the word “Routing” 
• It’s not the same as Load balancer routing which routes the traffic 
• DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries 

Route 53 Supports the following Routing Policies 
• Simple 
• Weighted 
• Failover 
• Latency based 
• Geolocation 
• Multi-Value Answer 
• Geoproximity (using Route 53 Traffic Flow feature)



VIP:
====
Weighted Routing Policy allows you to redirect part of the traffic based on weight (e.g., percentage). 
It's a common use case to send part of traffic to a new version of your application.

Each DNS record has a TTL (Time To Live) which orders clients for how long to cache these values and not overload the 
DNS Resolver with DNS requests. The TTL value should be set to strike a balance between how long the value should be cached vs. 
how many requests should go to the DNS Resolver.

Latency Routing Policy will evaluate the latency between your users and AWS Regions, and help them get a 
DNS response that will minimize their latency (e.g. response time)



You have a legal requirement that people in any country but France should NOT be able to access your website. 
Which Route 53 Routing Policy helps you in achieving this?
Geolocation.


You have purchased a domain on GoDaddy and would like to use Route 53 as the DNS Service Provider. 
What should you do to make this work?
Public Hosted Zones are meant to be used for people requesting your website through the Internet. Finally, NS records must be updated on the 3rd party Registrar.




=================================================
##Section 12: Amazon S3 Introduction
=================================================
S3 not a global service, need to region select for it.

Amazon S3 Overview – Objects (continued)
• Object values are the content of the body:
• Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

S3 Encryption for Objects, There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3:
• SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
• SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
• SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
• Client Side Encryption 

Multi-Part Upload is recommended as soon as the file is over 100 MB.
5GB is Max file size to upload.

With SSE-C, the encryption happens in AWS and you have full control over the encryption keys.

With SSE-KMS, the encryption happens in AWS, and the encryption keys are managed by AWS but you 
have full control over the rotation policy of the encryption key. Encryption keys stored in AWS.

With Client-Side Encryption, you have to do the encryption yourself and you have full control over the encryption keys. 
You perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS. 
AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data.

Explicit DENY in an IAM Policy will take precedence over an S3 bucket policy.


S3 Select & Glacier Select:
• Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server side filtering
• Can filter by rows & columns (simple SQL statements)
• Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side


S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge:
• Advanced filtering options with JSON rules (metadata, object size, name...)
• Multiple Destinations – ex Step Functions, Kinesis Streams / Firehose…
• EventBridge Capabilities – Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery


S3 – Requester Pays
-------------------------------------------------
• In general, bucket owners pay for all
Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs associated with their bucket

• With Requester Pays buckets, the
requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket

• Helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts
• The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)



MFA Delete forces users to use MFA codes before deleting S3 objects. 
It's an extra level of security to prevent accidental deletions.

S3 Access Logs log all the requests made to S3 buckets and Amazon Athena can then be used to run 
cserverless analytics on top of the log files.

S3 Replication allows you to replicate data from an S3 bucket to another in the same/different AWS Region.

S3 Pre-Signed URLs are temporary URLs that you generate to grant time-limited access to some actions in your S3 bucket.


S3 MFA-Delete:
• MFA (multi factor authentication) forces user to generate a code on a device (usually a
mobile phone or hardware) before doing important operations on S3
• Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA-Delete
• MFA-Delete currently can only be enabled using the CLI


S3 Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies:
• One way to “force encryption” is to use a bucket policy and refuse any
API call to PUT an S3 object without encryption headers

Another way is to use the “default encryption” option in S3
• Note: Bucket Policies are evaluated before “default encryption”

S3 Access Logs: Warning
• Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket
• It will create a logging loop, and your bucket will grow in size exponentially


S3 Replication – Notes
• After activating, only new objects are replicated
• Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using S3 Batch Replication
• Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication
• For DELETE operations:
• Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
• Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)
• There is no “chaining” of replication
• If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
• Then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3


S3 Pre-Signed URLs:
• Can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
• For downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
• For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
• Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with --expires-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS] argument
• Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for GET / PUT
• Examples :
• Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video on your S3 bucket
• Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically
• Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in our bucket

Transition actions:
These actions define when objects transition to another storage class. 
For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 
30 days after creating them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after creating them.




=================================================
##Section 15: CloudFront & AWS Global Accelerator
=================================================
CloudFront is a global service.

CloudFront– Origins:
-------------------------------------------------
• S3 bucket 
• For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
• Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
• CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3) 
Custom Origin (HTTP) 
• Application Load Balancer 
• EC2 instance 
• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website) 
• Any HTTP backend you want


CloudFront Geo Restriction:
-------------------------------------------------
• You can restrict who can access your distribution
• Whitelist: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the
countries on a list of approved countries.
• Blacklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the

countries on a blacklist of banned countries.
• The “country” is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database
• Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content


CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
-------------------------------------------------
CloudFront:
• Global Edge network
• Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
• Great for static content that must be available everywhere

S3 Cross Region Replication:
• Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
• Files are updated in near real-time
• Read only
• Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions


CloudFront Signed URL / Signed Cookies
-------------------------------------------------
• You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
• We can use CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie. We attach a policy with:
• Includes URL expiration
• Includes IP ranges to access the data from
• Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs)
• How long should the URL be valid for?
• Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
• Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
• Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
• Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)


CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL
-------------------------------------------------
CloudFront Signed URL:
• Allow access to a path, no matter
the origin
• Account wide key-pair, only the root
can manage it
• Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration
• Can leverage caching features

S3 Pre-Signed URL:
• Issue a request as the person who
pre-signed the URL
• Uses the IAM key of the signing
IAM principal
• Limited lifetime

CloudFront – Origin Groups
• To increase high-availability and do failover
• Origin Group: one primary and one secondary origin
• If the primary origin fails, the second one is used


CloudFront Signed URLs are commonly used to distribute paid content through dynamically generated signed URLs.

Signed Cookies are useful when you want to access multiple files.

AWS Global Accelerator will provide us with the two static IP addresses and the ALB will provide us with the HTTP routing rules.



=================================================
##Section 16: AWS Storage Extras
=================================================
Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge,
and migrate data into and out of AWS

What is Edge Computing?
-------------------------------------------------
• Process data while it’s being created on an edge location
• A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground

These locations may have
• Limited / no internet access
• Limited / no easy access to computing power

We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
Use cases of Edge Computing:
• Preprocess data
• Machine learning at the edge
• Transcoding media streams
Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)


Amazon FSx for Windows (File Server) 
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon FSx For Windows File Server does not have a parallel file system, unlike Lustre.

• EFS is a shared POSIX system for Linux systems. 
• FSx for Windows is a fully managed Windows file system share drive 
• Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS 
• Microsoft Active Directory integration, ACLs, user quotas 
• Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances 
• Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data 

Storage Options: 
• SSD – latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, …) 
• HDD – broad spectrum of workloads (home directory, CMS, …) 

• Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect) 
• Can be configured to be Multi-AZ (high availability) •
• Data is backed-up daily to S3



Amazon FSx for Lustre
-------------------------------------------------
FSx for Lustre is compatible with the most popular Linux-based AMIs, including Amazon Linux, 
Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, SUSE Linux and Ubuntu.

Since the Lustre file system is designed for high-performance computing workloads that typically run on compute clusters, 
choose EFS for normal Linux file system if your requirements don't match this use case.

FSx Lustre has the ability to store and retrieve data directly on S3 on its own.

• Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
• The name Lustre is derived from “Linux” and “cluster
• Machine Learning, High Performance Computing (HPC)
• Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
• Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

Storage Options:
• SSD – low-latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations
• HDD – throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations

• Seamless integration with S3
• Can “read S3” as a file system (through FSx)
• Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)
• Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)


FSx File System Deployment Options
-------------------------------------------------
Scratch File System
• Temporary storage
• Data is not replicated (doesn’t persist if file server fails)
• High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
• Usage: short-term processing, optimize costs

Persistent File System
• Long-term storage
• Data is replicated within same AZ
• Replace failed files within minutes
• Usage: long-term processing, sensitive data



AWS Storage Gateway
-------------------------------------------------
Storage Gateway is a way of Hybrid cloud make possible
Gateway mean Interface, FileGateway->FileInterface.(AWS Storage Gateway's file interface, or file gateway)


3 types of Storage Gateway:
• File Gateway
• Volume Gateway
• Tape Gateway


File Gateway:
• Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
• Supports S3 standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA
• Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
• Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
• Can be mounted on many servers
• Integrated with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication

Volume Gateway:

• Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
• Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes!
• Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
• Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3

Tape Gateway:
.
• Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
• With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
• Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
• Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
• Works with leading backup software vendors 


Amazon FSx File Gateway:
• Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
• Local cache for frequently accessed data
• Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory...)
• Useful for group file shares and home directories


AWS Storage Gateway Summary:
• Exam tip: Read the question well, it will hint at which gateway to use
• On-premises data to the cloud => Storage Gateway
• File access / NFS – user auth with Active Directory => File Gateway(backed by S3)
• Volumes / Block Storage / iSCSI => Volume gateway (backed by S3 with EBS snapshots)
• VTL Tape solution / Backup with iSCSI = > Tape Gateway (backed by S3 and Glacier)
• No on-premises virtualization => Hardware Appliance


AWS Transfer Family:
-------------------------------------------------
• A fully-managed service for file transfers into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using the FTP protocol

Supported Protocols
• AWS Transfer for FTP (File Transfer Protocol (FTP))
• AWS Transfer for FTPS (File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS))
• AWS Transfer for SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP))

• Managed infrastructure, Scalable, Reliable, Highly Available (multi-AZ)
• Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
• Store and manage users’ credentials within the service
• Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft Active Directory,LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
• Usage: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP.



Storage Comparison:
• S3: Object Storage
• Glacier: Object Archival
• EFS: Network File System for Linux instances, POSIX filesystem
• FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
• FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
• EBS volumes: Network storage for one EC2 instance at a time
• Instance Storage: Physical storage for your EC2 instance (high IOPS)
• Storage Gateway: File Gateway, Volume Gateway (cache & stored), Tape Gateway
• Snowball / Snowmobile: to move large amount of data to the cloud, physically
• Database: for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying

Snowball Edge is the right answer as it comes with computing capabilities and allows you to pre-process the data while it's being moved into Snowball.




=================================================
##Section 17: Decoupling applications: SQS, SNS, Kinesis, Active MQ
=================================================
Decouple your applications using:
• using SQS: queue model
• using SNS: pub/sub model
• using Kinesis: real-time streaming model
• These services can scale independently from our application!



Amazon SQS:
-------------------------------------------------

Standard Queue:
	• Oldest offering (over 10 years old)
	• Fully managed service, used to decouple applications
	• Attributes:
	• Unlimited throughput, unlimited number of messages in queue
	• Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
	• Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
	• Limitation of 256KB per message sent
	• Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)
	• Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)

SQS FIFO:
(First-In-First-Out) Queues have all the capabilities of the SQS Standard Queue, plus the following two features. 
First, The order in which messages are sent and received are strictly preserved and a message is 
delivered once and remains available until a consumer process and deletes it. 
Second, duplicated messages are not introduced into the queue.


SQS Delay Queues is a period of time during which Amazon SQS keeps new SQS messages invisible to consumers. 
In SQS Delay Queues, a message is hidden when it is first added to the queue. (default: 0 mins, max.: 15 mins)


When SQS Long Polling is enabled, Amazon SQS reducing the number of empty responses when there are no messages 
available to return and eliminating false empty responses (when SQS messages are available but aren't included in a response).

SQS Visibility Timeout is a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing 
the message again. In Visibility Timeout, a message is hidden only after it is consumed from the queue. 
Increasing the Visibility Timeout gives more time to the consumer to process the message and prevent 
duplicate reading of the message. (default: 30 sec., min.: 0 sec., max.: 12 hours)

SQS Dead Letter Queue is where other SQS queues (source queues) can send messages that can't be processed (consumed) 
successfully. It's useful for debugging as it allows you to isolate problematic messages so 
you can debug why their processing doesn't succeed.


This is a common pattern where only one message is sent to the SNS topic and then "fan-out" to multiple SQS queues. 
This approach has the following features: it's fully decoupled, no data loss, and you have the ability to add more
SQS queues (more applications) over time.


The capacity limits of a Kinesis data stream are defined by the number of shards within the data stream. 
The limits can be exceeded by either data throughput or the number of reading data calls. Each shard allows for 
1 MB/s incoming data and 2 MB/s outgoing data. You should increase the number of shards within 
your data stream to provide enough capacity.


Kinesis Data Stream uses the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a 
given data record belongs to. When you use the identity of each user as the partition key, this ensures the 
data for each user is ordered hence 
sent to the same shard.


Which AWS service is most appropriate when you want to perform real-time analytics on streams of data?
Use Kinesis Data Analytics with Kinesis Data Streams as the underlying source of data.


This is a perfect combo of technology for loading data near real-time data into S3 and Redshift. 
Kinesis Data Firehose supports custom data transformations using AWS Lambda.


Which of the following is NOT a supported subscriber for AWS SNS?
Kinesis Data Firehose is now supported, but not Kinesis Data Streams.

Amazon MQ supports industry-standard APIs such as JMS and NMS, and protocols for messaging, 
including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket.




Kinesis:
-------------------------------------------------
What is a source in Kinesis Data Firehose?
A source is where your streaming data is continuously generated and captured. For example, a source can be a logging server 
running on Amazon EC2 instances, an application running on mobile devices, or a sensor on an IoT device. 
You can connect your sources to Kinesis Data Firehose using 
1) Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose API, which uses the AWS SDK for Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, or Ruby. 
2) Kinesis Data Stream, where Kinesis Data Firehose reads data easily from an existing Kinesis data 
stream and load it into Kinesis Data Firehose destinations. 
3) AWS natively supported Service like AWS Cloudwatch, AWS EventBridge, AWS IOT, or AWS Pinpoint. 
For complete list, see the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose developer guide. 
4) Kinesis Agents, which is a stand-alone Java software application that continuously monitors a set of files and 
sends new data to your stream. 
5) Fluentbit, which an open source Log Processor and Forwarder. 
6) AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You can use write your Lambda function to send traffic from S3 or DynamoDB to 
Kinesis Data Firehose based on a triggered event.

What is a destination in Kinesis Data Firehose?
A destination is the data store where your data will be delivered. 
Kinesis Data Firehose currently supports Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Splunk, Datadog, 
NewRelic, Dynatrace, Sumologic, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, and HTTP End Point as destinations.


• Makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze streaming data in real-time
• Ingest real-time data such as: Application logs, Metrics, Website clickstreams, IoT telemetry data
• Kinesis Data Streams: capture, process, and store data streams
• Kinesis Data Firehose: load data streams into AWS data stores
• Kinesis Data Analytics: analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink
• Kinesis Video Streams: capture, process, and store video streams


Kinesis Data Streams vs Firehose:

Kinesis Data Streams:
• Streaming service for ingest at scale
• Write custom code (producer / consumer)
• Real-time (~200 ms)
• Manage scaling (shard splitting / merging)
• Data storage for 1 to 365 days
• Supports replay capability

Kinesis Data Firehose:
• Load streaming data into S3 / Redshift / ES / 3rd party / custom HTTP
• Fully managed
• Near real-time (buffer time min. 60 sec)
• Automatic scaling
• No data storage
• Doesn’t support replay capability

Kinesis Data Analytics (SQL application):
• Perform real-time analytics on Kinesis Streams using SQL
• Fully managed, no servers to provision
• Automatic scaling
• Real-time analytics
• Pay for actual consumption rate
• Can create streams out of the real-time queries
• Use cases:
• Time-series analytics
• Real-time dashboards
• Real-time metrics


Kinesis vs SQS ordering:
• Let’s assume 100 trucks, 5 kinesis shards, 1 SQS FIFO

Kinesis Data Streams:
• On average you’ll have 20 trucks per shard
• Trucks will have their data ordered within each shard
• The maximum amount of consumers in parallel we can have is 5
• Can receive up to 5 MB/s of data

SQS FIFO
• You only have one SQS FIFO queue
• You will have 100 Group ID
• You can have up to 100 Consumers (due to the 100 Group ID)
• You have up to 300 messages per second (or 3000 if using batching)



Amazon MQ:
-------------------------------------------------
• SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services, and they’re using proprietary protocols from AWS.
• Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
• When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
• Amazon MQ = managed Apache ActiveMQ
• Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
• Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine, can run in HA with failover
• Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)




=================================================
##Section 18: Containers on AWS: ECS, Fargate, ECR & EKS
=================================================
Docker Containers Management on AWS:

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
• Amazon’s own container platform

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
• Amazon’s managed Kubernetes (open source)

AWS Fargate
• Amazon’s own Serverless container platform
• Works with ECS and with EKS

Amazon ECR:
• Store container images



Note:
• Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system



Amazon ECS - EC2 Launch Type
• ECS = Elastic Container Service
• Launch Docker containers on AWS =
Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters
• EC2 Launch Type: you must provision
& maintain the infrastructure (the EC2
instances)
• Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS
Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
• AWS takes care of starting / stopping
containers



Amazon ECS – Fargate Launch Type
• Launch Docker containers on AWS
• You do not provision the infrastructure
(no EC2 instances to manage)
• It’s all Serverless!
• You just create task definitions
• AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based
on the CPU / RAM you need
• To scale, just increase the number of
tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances


ECS Task Role:
• Allows each task to have a specific role
• Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
• Task Role is defined in the task definition



Amazon EKS Overview:
---------------------------------------------------
• Amazon EKS = Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
• It is a way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
• Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and
management of containerized (usually Docker) application
• It’s an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
• EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or Fargate to deploy
serverless containers
• Use case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in
another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
• Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud – Azure, GCP…)
• For multiple regions, deploy one EKS cluster per region



Amazon ECS – Load Balancer Integrations:

• Application Load Balancer supported
and works for most use cases

• Network Load Balancer recommended
only for high throughput / high
performance use cases, or to pair it with
AWS Private Link

• Elastic Load Balancer supported but not
recommended (no advanced features –
no Fargate)



EC2 Launch Type – Auto Scaling EC2 Instances:
• Accommodate ECS Service Scaling by adding underlying EC2 Instances

Auto Scaling Group Scaling
• Scale your ASG based on CPU Utilization
• Add EC2 instances over time

ECS Cluster Capacity Provider
• Used to automatically provision and scale the infrastructure for your ECS Tasks
• Capacity Provider paired with an Auto Scaling Group
• Add EC2 Instances when you’re missing capacity (CPU, RAM…)



EC2 Instance Profile is the IAM Role used by the ECS Agent on the EC2 instance to execute ECS-specific 
actions such as pulling Docker images from ECR and storing the container logs into CloudWatch Logs.

ECS Task Role is the IAM Role used by the ECS task itself. Use when your container wants to call 
other AWS services like S3, SQS, etc.

EFS volume can be shared between different EC2 instances and different ECS Tasks. 
It can be used as a persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers.

Amazon ECR is a fully managed container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, share, and deploy your container images. 
It won't help in running your Docker-based applications.




=================================================
##Section 19: Serverless Overviews from a Solution Architect Perspective
=================================================

 Serverless does not mean there are no servers…
it means you just don’t manage / provision / see them

Serverless in AWS:

• AWS Lambda 
• DynamoDB 
• AWS Cognito 
• AWS API Gateway 
• Amazon S3 
• AWS SNS & SQS 
• AWS Kinesis Data Firehose 
• Aurora Serverless 
• Step Functions 
• Fargate




AWS Lambda Limits to Know - per region
-------------------------------------------------
Execution:
• Memory allocation: 128 MB – 10GB (1 MB increments)
• Maximum execution time: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
• Environment variables (4 KB)
• Disk capacity in the “function container” (in /tmp): 512 MB
• Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)

Deployment:
• Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
• Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
• Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup

• Intelligently Route Across Origins and Data Centers 
• Bot Mitigation at the Edge 
• Real-time Image Transformation 
• A/B Testing 
• User Authentication and Authorization 
• User Prioritization 
• User Tracking and Analytics


DynamoDB - Basics:
• DynamoDB is made of Tables
• Each table has a Primary Key (must be decided at creation time)
• Each table can have an infinite number of items (= rows)
• Each item has attributes (can be added over time – can be null)
• Maximum size of an item is 400KB
Data types supported are:
• Scalar Types – String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
• Document Types – List, Map
• Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set


DynamoDB – Read/Write Capacity Modes:
Control how you manage your table’s capacity (read/write throughput)

Provisioned Mode (default)
• You specify the number of reads/writes per second
• You need to plan capacity beforehand
• Pay for provisioned Read Capacity Units (RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCU)
• Possibility to add auto-scaling mode for RCU & WCU

On-Demand Mode
• Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
• No capacity planning needed
• Pay for what you use, more expensive ($$$)
• Great for unpredictable workloads


DynamoDB Streams:
Ordered stream of item-level modifications (create/update/delete) in a table

Stream records can be:
• Sent to Kinesis Data Streams
• Read by AWS Lambda
• Read by Kinesis Client Library applications
• Data Retention for up to 24 hours

Use cases:
• react to changes in real-time (welcome email to users)
• Analytics
• Insert into derivative tables
• Insert into ElasticSearch
• Implement cross-region replication


AWS API Gateway :
• AWS Lambda + API Gateway: No infrastructure to manage 
• Support for the WebSocket Protocol 
• Handle API versioning (v1, v2…) 
• Handle different environments (dev, test, prod…) 
• Handle security (Authentication and Authorization) 
• Create API keys, handle request throttling 
• Swagger / Open API import to quickly define APIs 
• Transform and validate requests and responses 
• Generate SDK and API specifications 
• Cache API responses


API Gateway – Integrations High Level:
Lambda Function
• Invoke Lambda function
• Easy way to expose REST API backed by AWS Lambda

HTTP
• Expose HTTP endpoints in the backend
• Example: internal HTTP API on premise, Application Load Balancer…
• Why? Add rate limiting, caching, user authentications, API keys, etc…

AWS Service
• Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway?
• Example: start an AWS Step Function workflow, post a message to SQS
• Why? Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate control…


API Gateway – Security – Summary
IAM:
• Great for users / roles already within your AWS account
• Handle authentication + authorization
• Leverages Sig v4

Custom Authorizer:
• Great for 3rd party tokens
• Very flexible in terms of what IAM policy is returned
• Handle Authentication + Authorization
• Pay per Lambda invocation

Cognito User Pool:
• You manage your own user pool (can be backed by Facebook, Google login etc…)
• No need to write any custom code
• Must implement authorization in the backend 



AWS Cognito:
We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our
application.

Cognito User Pools:
• Sign in functionality for app users
• Integrate with API Gateway

Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):
• Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly
• Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider

Cognito Sync:
• Synchronize data from device to Cognito.
• May be deprecated and replaced by AppSync 


SAM = Serverless Application Model
• Framework for developing and deploying serverless applications

All the configuration is YAML code
• Lambda Functions
• DynamoDB tables
• API Gateway
• Cognito User Pools
SAM can help you to run Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB locally
SAM can use CodeDeploy to deploy Lambda functions


AWS Cognito:
• We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our application.
• Cognito User Pools:
• Sign in functionality for app users
• Integrate with API Gateway
• Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):
• Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly
• Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider
• Cognito Sync:
• Synchronize data from device to Cognito.
• May be deprecated and replaced by AppSync 

Premium User Video service:
• We have implemented a fully serverless solution:
• Cognito for authentication
• DynamoDB for storing users that are premium
• 2 serverless applications
	• Premium User registration
	• CloudFront Signed URL generator
• Content is stored in S3 (serverless and scalable)
• Integrated with CloudFront with OAI for security (users can’t bypass)
• CloudFront can only be used using Signed URLs to prevent unauthorized users
• What about S3 Signed URL? They’re not efficient for global access


Why CloudFront?
• No changes to architecture
• Will cache software update files at the edge
• Software update files are not dynamic, they’re static (never changing)
• Our EC2 instances aren’t serverless
• But CloudFront is, and will scale for us
• Our ASG will not scale as much, and we’ll save tremendously in EC2
• We’ll also save in availability, network bandwidth cost, etc
• Easy way to make an existing application more scalable and cheaper!


Big Data Ingestion Pipeline discussion:
• IoT Core allows you to harvest data from IoT devices
• Kinesis is great for real-time data collection
• Firehose helps with data delivery to S3 in near real-time (1 minute)
• Lambda can help Firehose with data transformations
• Amazon S3 can trigger notifications to SQS
• Lambda can subscribe to SQS (we could have connecter S3 to Lambda)
• Athena is a serverless SQL service and results are stored in S3
• The reporting bucket contains analyzed data and can be used by
reporting tool such as AWS QuickSight, Redshift, etc



DynamoDB is serverless with no servers to provision, patch, or manage and no software to install, maintain or operate. 
It automatically scales tables up and down to adjust for capacity and maintain performance. 
It provides both provisioned (specify RCU & WCU) and on-demand (pay for what you use) capacity modes.

RCU and WCU are decoupled, so you can increase/decrease each value separately.

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to 
10x performance improvement. It caches the most frequently used data, thus offloading the heavy reads on 
hot keys off your DynamoDB table,


DynamoDB Streams allows you to capture a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in a DynamoDB table. 
It's integrated with AWS Lambda so that you create triggers that automatically respond to events in real-time.


An Edge-Optimized API Gateway is best for geographically distributed clients. 
API requests are routed to the nearest CloudFront Edge Location which improves latency. 
The API Gateway still lives in one AWS Region.

Lambda@Edge is a feature of CloudFront that lets you run code closer to your users, which 
improves performance and reduces latency.


Mibile client to direct S3, for Authentication use AWSCognito and STS
Mobile client to CloudFront to S3 then use OAI to access S3 from of CloudFront


Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. 
Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, 
such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect

DynamoDB Streams enable DynamoDB to get a changelog and use that changelog to replicate data across replica 
tables in other AWS Regions.

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds. Amazon CloudFront can be used in front of 
an Application Load Balancer.


Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. 
It can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of sources such as website clickstreams, 
database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.

================================================
##Section 22: AWS Monitoring & Audit: CloudWatch, CloudTrail & Config
=================================================

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that allows you to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide 
performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. 
It is used to monitor your applications' performance and metrics.


AWS CloudTrail allows you to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your 
AWS infrastructure. It provides the event history of your AWS account activity, audit API calls made through the 
AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI. So, the EC2 instance termination API call will appear here. 
You can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts.


You can use the CloudTrail Console to view the last 90 days of recorded API activity. 
For events older than 90 days, use Athena to analyze CloudTrail logs stored in S3.



AWS CloudWatch Metrics
• CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
• Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn…)
• Metrics belong to namespaces
• Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc…).
• Up to 10 dimensions per metric
• Metrics have timestamps
• Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

Dimensions are name/value pairs that categorize metric characteristics. 
Each metric you create can have up to 10 dimensions defined. 
You can use these dimensions to distinguish between multiple instances of the same service and to 
filter metrics by service use. For example, you can assign InstanceId dimensions to your 
EC2 instances to distinguish between them for monitoring.


EC2 Detailed monitoring
• EC2 instance metrics have metrics “every 5 minutes”
• With detailed monitoring (for a cost), you get data “every 1 minute”
• Use detailed monitoring if you want to scale faster for your ASG!
• The AWS Free Tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics
• Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed
from inside the instance as a custom metric)


CloudWatch Custom Metrics
• Possibility to define and send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch
• Example: memory (RAM) usage, disk space, number of logged in users …
• Use API call PutMetricData
• Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics
• Instance.id
• Environment.name
• Metric resolution (StorageResolution API parameter – two possible value):
• Standard: 1 minute (60 seconds)
• High Resolution: 1/5/10/30 second(s) – Higher cost
• Important: Accepts metric data points two weeks in the past and two hours in the
future (make sure to configure your EC2 instance time correctly)

CloudWatch Logs
• Log groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application
• Log stream: instances within application / log files / containers
• Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 30 days, etc..)
• CloudWatch Logs can send logs to:
• Amazon S3 (exports)
• Kinesis Data Streams
• Kinesis Data Firehose
• AWS Lambda
• ElasticSearch

CloudWatch Logs- Sources
• SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent, CloudWatch Unified Agent 
• Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application 
• ECS: collection from containers 
• AWS Lambda: collection from function logs 
• VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs 
• API Gateway 
• CloudTrail based on filter 
• Route53: Log DNS queries


CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent
• For virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premises servers…)
• CloudWatch Logs Agent
• Old version of the agent
• Can only send to CloudWatch Logs

CloudWatch Unified Agent
• Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc…
• Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
• Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store


CloudWatch Unified Agent – Metrics
• Collected directly on your Linux server / EC2 instance
• CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal)
• Disk metrics (free, used, total), Disk IO (writes, reads, bytes, iops)
• RAM (free, inactive, used, total, cached)
• Netstat (number of TCP and UDP connections, net packets, bytes)
• Processes (total, dead, bloqued, idle, running, sleep)
• Swap Space (free, used, used %)
• Reminder: out-of-the box metrics for EC2 – disk, CPU, network (high level)


Amazon EventBridge
• EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events
• Default Event Bus – generated by AWS services (CloudWatch Events)
• Partner Event Bus – receive events from SaaS service or applications (Zendesk,
DataDog, Segment, Auth0…)
• Custom Event Buses – for your own applications
• Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts
• You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
• Ability to replay archived events
• Rules: how to process the events (like CloudWatch Events)


Amazon EventBridge vs CloudWatch Events:
• Amazon EventBridge builds upon and extends CloudWatch Events.
• It uses the same service API and endpoint, and the same underlying service
infrastructure.
• EventBridge allows extension to add event buses for your custom
applications and your third-party SaaS apps.
• Event Bridge has the Schema Registry capability
• EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities
• Over time, the CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge.


AWS CloudTrail:
• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
	• Console
	• SDK
	• CLI
	• AWS Services
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
• If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!



CloudTrail Events:
• Management Events:
	• Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
	• Examples:
		• Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
		• Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
		• Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
	• By default, trails are configured to log management events.
	• Can separate Read Events (that don’t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources)
• Data Events:
	• By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)
	• Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events
	• AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)
• CloudTrail Insights Events:
 • See next slide J

• Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources
• Helps record configurations and changes over time
• Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
	• Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
	• Do my buckets have any public access?
	• How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
• You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes
• AWS Config is a per-region service
• Can be aggregated across regions and accounts
• Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)


Config Rules:
• Can use AWS managed config rules (over 75)
• Can make custom config rules (must be defined in AWS Lambda)
	• Ex: evaluate if each EBS disk is of type gp2
	• Ex: evaluate if each EC2 instance is t2.micro
• Rules can be evaluated / triggered:
	• For each config change
	• And / or: at regular time intervals
• AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)

• Pricing: no free tier, $0.003 per configuration item recorded per region,
$0.001 per config rule evaluation per region



CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config:
• CloudWatch 
	• Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network, etc…) & dashboards 
	• Events & Alerting 
	• Log Aggregation & Analysis 
• CloudTrail 
	• Record API calls made within your Account by everyone 
	• Can define trails for specific resources 
	• Global Service 
• Config 
	• Record configuration changes 
	• Evaluate resources against compliance rules 
	• Get timeline of changes and compliance



For an Elastic Load Balancer
• CloudWatch:
	• Monitoring Incoming connections metric
	• Visualize error codes as % over time
	• Make a dashboard to get an idea of your load balancer performance
• Config:
	• Track security group rules for the Load Balancer
	• Track configuration changes for the Load Balancer
	• Ensure an SSL certificate is always assigned to the Load Balancer (compliance)
• CloudTrail:
	• Track who made any changes to the Load Balancer with API calls





=================================================
##Section 23: Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Advanced
=================================================
AWS STS – Security Token Service
• Allows to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources.
• Token is valid for up to one hour (must be refreshed)
• AssumeRole
	• Within your own account: for enhanced security
	• Cross Account Access: assume role in target account to perform actions there
• AssumeRoleWithSAML
	• return credentials for users logged with SAML
	• AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
	• return creds for users logged with an IdP (Facebook Login, Google Login, OIDC compatible…)
• AWS recommends against using this, and using Cognito instead
	• GetSessionToken
	• for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user


Using STS to Assume a Role:
• Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
• Define which principals can access this IAM Role
• Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you
have access to (AssumeRole API)
• Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour



Identity Federation in AWS:
• Federation lets users outside of AWS to assume temporary role for accessing AWS resources.
• These users assume identity provided access role.
• Federations can have many flavors:
	• SAML 2.0
	• Custom Identity Broker
	• Web Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito
	• Web Identity Federation without Amazon Cognito
	• Single Sign On
	• Non-SAML with AWS Microsoft AD
• Using federation, you don’t need to create IAM users
(user management is outside of AWS)



SAML 2.0 Federation:
• To integrate Active Directory / ADFS with AWS (or any SAML 2.0)
• Provides access to AWS Console or CLI (through temporary creds)
• No need to create an IAM user for each of your employees


Custom Identity Broker Application:
• Use only if identity provider is not compatible with SAML 2.0
• The identity broker must determine the appropriate IAM policy
• Uses the STS API: AssumeRole or GetFederationToken


AWS Cognito:
• Goal:
	• Provide direct access to AWS Resources from
	the Client Side (mobile, web app)
• Example:
	• provide (temporary) access to write to S3
	bucket using Facebook Login
• Problem:
	• We don’t want to create IAM users for our app
	users
• How:
	• Log in to federated identity provider – or
	remain anonymous
	• Get temporary AWS credentials back from the
	Federated Identity Pool
	• These credentials come with a pre-defined IAM
	policy stating their permissions




AWS Directory Services:
AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	• Create your own AD in AWS, manage users
	locally, supports MFA
	• Establish “trust” connections with your on- premises AD
AD Connector
	• Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on- premises AD, supports MFA
	• Users are managed on the on-premises AD
Simple AD
	• AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
	• Cannot be joined with on-premises AD


AWS Organizations:
• Global service
• Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
• The main account is the master account – you can’t change it
• Other accounts are member accounts
• Member accounts can only be part of one organization
• Consolidated Billing across all accounts - single payment method
• Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3…)
• API is available to automate AWS account creation


Service Control Policies (SCP):
• Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
• Applied at the OU or Account level
• Does not apply to the Master Account
• SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root user
• The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
• Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations
and can't be restricted by SCPs.
• SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
• Use cases:
• Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)
• Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services



AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) helps you securely share your AWS resources within your organization or 
organizational units (OUs) in AWS Organizations and with AWS Accounts. You can also share resources with IAM Roles and IAM Users.



Amazon Cognito can be used to federate mobile user accounts and provide them with their own IAM permissions, 
so they can be able to acces`s their own personal 
space in the S3 bucket.





=================================================
##Section 24: AWS Security & Encryption: KMS, SSM Parameter Store, CloudHSM, Shield, WAF
=================================================
KMS Key bound in a specificed region.


Encryption in flight (SSL):
• Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
• SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
• Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen


KMS – Customer Master Key (CMK) Types:

Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
• First offering of KMS, single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
• AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
• Necessary for envelope encryption
• You never get access to the Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)

Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
• Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
• Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
• The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted
• Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API



AWS KMS (Key Management Service) :
• Able to fully manage the keys & policies: 
	• Create 
	• Rotation policies 
	• Disable 
	• Enable 
• Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail) 
• Three types of Customer Master Keys (CMK): 
	• AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free 
	• User Keys created in KMS: $1 / month 
	• User Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month 
+ pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)



KMS Key Policies:
• Control access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies
• Difference: you cannot control access without them
Default KMS Key Policy:
	• Created if you don’t provide a specific KMS Key Policy
	• Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account
	• Gives access to the IAM policies to the KMS key
Custom KMS Key Policy:
	• Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
	• Define who can administer the key
	• Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key



KMS Automatic Key Rotation
• For Customer-managed CMK (not AWS managed CMK)
• If enabled: automatic key rotation happens every 1 year
• Previous key is kept active so you can decrypt old data
• New Key has the same CMK ID (only the backing key is changed)


KMS Alias Updating
• Better to use aliases in this case (to hide the change of key for the
application)



Parameters Policies (for advanced parameters)
• Allow to assign a TTL to a parameter (expiration date) to force
updating or deleting sensitive data such as passwords
• Can assign multiple policies at a time



AWS Secrets Manager:L
• Newer service, meant for storing secrets
• Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
• Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
• Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)
• Secrets are encrypted using KMS
• Mostly meant for RDS integration



AWS Shield:
• AWS Shield Standard:
• Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
• Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks
and other layer 3/layer 4 attacks

AWS Shield Advanced:
• Optional DDoS mitigation service ($3,000 per month per organization)
• Protect against more sophisticated attack on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load
Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53
• 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
• Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS


AWS WAF – Web Application Firewall:
• Protects your web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)
• Layer 7 is HTTP (vs Layer 4 is TCP)
• Deploy on Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront
• Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List):
	• Rules can include: IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
	• Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	• Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
	• Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) – for DDoS protection



Amazon GuardDuty
• Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account
• Uses Machine Learning algorithms, anomaly detection, 3rd party data
• One click to enable (30 days trial), no need to install software
• Input data includes:
	• CloudTrail Events Logs – unusual API calls, unauthorized deployments
	• CloudTrail Management Events – create VPC subnet, create trail, …
	• CloudTrail S3 Data Events – get object, list objects, delete object, …
	• VPC Flow Logs – unusual internal traffic, unusual IP address
	• DNS Logs – compromised EC2 instances sending encoded data within DNS queries
	• Kubernetes Audit Logs – suspicious activities and potential EKS cluster compromises
• Can setup CloudWatch Event rules to be notified in case of findings
• CloudWatch Events rules can target AWS Lambda or SNS
• Can protect against CryptoCurrency attacks (has a dedicated “finding” for it)

What does AWS Inspector evaluate?
• Remember: only for EC2 instances and container infrastructure
• Continuous scanning of the infrastructure, only when needed
• Package vulnerabilities (EC2 & ECR) – database of CVE
• Network reachability (EC2)
• A risk score is associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritization


Amazon Macie:
• Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service
that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.
• Macie helps identify and alert you to sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII)


AWS Shared Responsibility Model
-------------------------------------------
• AWS responsibility - Security of the Cloud
	• Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities, and networking) that runs
	all the AWS services
	• Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.
• Customer responsibility - Security in the Cloud
	• For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS
	(including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
	• Encrypting application data
• Shared controls:
• Patch Management, Configuration Management, Awareness & Training




Example, for RDS:
AWS responsibility:
	• Manage the underlying EC2 instance, disable SSH access
	• Automated DB patching
	• Automated OS patching
	• Audit the underlying instance and disks & guarantee it functions
Your responsibility:
	• Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB’s SG
	• In-database user creation and permissions
	• Creating a database with or without public access
	• Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
	• Database encryption setting

Example, for S3 • 

AWS responsibility: 
• Guarantee you get unlimited storage 
• Guarantee you get encryption 
• Ensure separation of the data between different customers 
• Ensure AWS employees can’t access your data 

Your responsibility: 
• Bucket configuration 
• Bucket policy / public setting 
• IAM user and roles 
• Enabling encryption


Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security service that uses Machine Learning to discover and protect your sensitive data 
stored in S3 buckets. It automatically provides an inventory of S3 buckets including a list of unencrypted buckets, 
publicly accessible buckets, and buckets shared with other AWS accounts. It allows you to identify and 
alert you to sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).



AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall 
rules across your accounts and applications in AWS Organizations. It is integrated with AWS Organizations so you can enable 
AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced protection, security groups, AWS Network Firewall rules, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver 
DNS Firewall rules.




SSM Parameters Store can be used to store secrets and has built-in version tracking capability. 
Each time you edit the value of a parameter, SSM Parameter Store creates a new version of the parameter and retains the previous 
versions. You can view the details, including the values, of all versions in a parameter's history.



KMS keys can be symmetric or asymmetric. A symmetric KMS key represents a 256-bit key used for encryption and decryption. 
An asymmetric KMS key represents an RSA key pair used for encryption and decryption or signing and verification, but not both. 
Or it represents an elliptic curve (ECC) key pair used for signing and verification.




In-flight Encryption = HTTPS, and HTTPS can not be enabled without an SSL certificate.


=================================================
##Section 25: Networking - VPC
=================================================
VPC in AWS – IPv4:
VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region – soft limit)
	• Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
	• Min. size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
	• Max. size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed:
	• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
	• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
	• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks (e.g., corporate)



VPC – Subnet (IPv4):
• AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
• These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can’t be assigned to an
EC2 instance
Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:
	• 10.0.0.0 – Network Address
	• 10.0.0.1 – reserved by AWS for the VPC router
	• 10.0.0.2 – reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
	• 10.0.0.3 – reserved by AWS for future use
	• 10.0.0.255 – Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, 
	  therefore the address is reserved
Exam Tip, if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
• You can’t choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 – 5 = 27 < 29)
• You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 – 5 = 59 > 29)




Internet Gateway (IGW)
• Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC connect to the Internet
• It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
• Must be created separately from a VPC
• One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
• Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access…
• Route tables must also be edited!



Bastion Hosts
• We can use a Bastion Host to SSH into our
private EC2 instances
• The bastion is in the public subnet which is
then connected to all other private subnets
• Bastion Host security group must be tightened
• Exam Tip: Make sure the bastion host only has
port 22 traffic from the IP address you need,
not from the security groups of your other
EC2 instances



NAT Instance – Comments:
Pre-configured Amazon Linux AMI is available
• Reached the end of standard support on December 31, 2020
Not highly available / resilient setup out of the box
• You need to create an ASG in multi-AZ + resilient user-data script
Internet traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance type
You must manage Security Groups & rules:
• Inbound:
	• Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from Private Subnets
	• Allow SSH from your home network (access is provided through Internet Gateway)
• Outbound:
	• Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic to the Internet



NAT Gateway:
• AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
• Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
• NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
• Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other
subnets)
• Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
• 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 45 Gbps
• No Security Groups to manage / required


• NAT Gateway is resilient within a single Availability Zone
• Must create multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs for fault-tolerance
• There is no cross-AZ failover needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT


DNS Resolution in VPC
• DNS Resolution (enableDnsSupport)
• Decides if DNS resolution from Route 53 Resolver server is supported for the VPC
• True (default): it queries the Amazon Provider DNS Server at 169.254.169.253 or the
reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two (.2)

DNS Resolution in VPC
• DNS Hostnames (enableDnsHostnames)
• By default,
• True => default VPC
• False => newly created VPCs
• Won’t do anything unless enableDnsSupport=true
• If True, assigns public hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public IPv4

DNS Resolution in VPC
• If you use custom DNS domain names in a Private Hosted Zone in
Route 53, you must set both these attributes (enableDnsSupport &
enableDnsHostname) to true



Network Access Control List (NACL):
• NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnets
• One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned the Default NACL
• You define NACL Rules:
	• Rules have a number (1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number
	• First rule match will drive the decision
	• Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 DENY 10.0.0.10/32, the IP
	address will be allowed because 100 has a higher precedence over 200
	• The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match
• AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
• Newly created NACLs will deny everything
• NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level


Accepts everything inbound/outbound with the subnets it’s associated with
• Do NOT modify the Default NACL, instead create custom NACLs

Ephemeral Ports
• For any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports
• Clients connect to a defined port, and expect a response on an ephemeral port
• Different Operating Systems use different port ranges, examples:
	• IANA & MS Windows 10 è 49152 – 65535
	• Many Linux Kernels è 32768 – 60999


VPC – Reachability Analyzer
• A network diagnostics tool that troubleshoots
network connectivity between two endpoints
in your VPC(s)
• It builds a model of the network configuration,
then checks the reachability based on these
configurations (it doesn’t send packets)
• When the destination is
	• Reachable – it produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path
	• Not reachable – it identifies the blocking component(s) (e.g., configuration issues in SGs,
NACLs, Route Tables, …)
• Use cases: troubleshoot connectivity issues,
ensure network configuration is as intended,



VPC Peering:
• Privately connect two VPCs using AWS’network
• Make them behave as if they were in the
same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDRs • VPC Peering connection is NOT transitive
(must be established for each VPC that
need to communicate with one another)
• You must update route tables in each VPC’s
subnets to ensure EC2 instances can
communicate with each other


You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWS
accounts/regions
• You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (works cross
accounts – same region)


VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
• Every AWS service is publicly exposed(public URL)
• VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS
services using a private network instead of using the public Internet
• They’re redundant and scale horizontally
• They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, …to access AWS Services
• In case of issues:
• Check DNS Setting Resolution in your VPC
• Check Route Tables



Types of Endpoints
--------------------------------------------------

There are three types of VPC endpoints: 
	gateway load balancer endpoints, 
	gateway endpoints,
	interface endpoints.
	
Gateway Load Balancer endpoint:
	The first type of endpoint, a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, allows you to intercept traffic and route 
	it to a network or security service that you’ve configured using a Gateway Load Balancer. 
	Gateway load balancers enable you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, 
	such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems. 
UserReq->GWLB->GWLBE->VPC->EC2

Gateway endpoint:
	The second type of endpoint, a Gateway endpoint, allows you to provide access to 
	Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. You can configure resource policies 
	on both the gateway endpoint and the AWS resource that the endpoint provides access to.


Interface endpoint:
	The third type of endpoint, an Interface endpoint, allows you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. 
	This includes a large number of AWS services. It also can also include services hosted by other 
	AWS customers, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners in their own VPCs. 
	By using AWS partner services through AWS PrivateLink, you no longer have to rely on access to the public internet. 


 A VPC endpoint policy is an AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) resource policy that you can attach to an endpoint. 
 It is a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service. 
 
 
Interface Endpoints:
• Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a Security Group)
• Supports most AWS services

Gateway Endpoints:
• Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in a route table
• Supports both S3 and DynamoDB


A gateway connects dissimilar networks. You can think of a gateway as a protocol converter. 
AWS VPC uses an internet gateway to connect an AWS private network to the world wide web.


VPC Flow Logs:
• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	• VPC Flow Logs
	• Subnet Flow Logs
	• Elastic Network Interface (ENI) Flow Logs
• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues
• Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs
• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: ELB,
RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, WorkSpaces, NATGW, Transit Gateway


WS Site-to-Site VPN
• Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
• VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
• VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection
• Possibility to customize the ASN (Autonomous System Number)

Customer Gateway (CGW)
• Software application or physical device on customer side of the VPN connection


Site-to-Site VPN Connections:
----------------------------------------------
To create a VPN connection, you must create a customer gateway resource in AWS, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. Next, you have to set up an Internet-routable IP address (static) of the customer gateway’s external interface.
don’t need a NAT instance for you to be able to create a VPN connection.


Customer Gateway Device (On-premises)
• What IP address to use?
	• Public Internet-routable IP address for your Customer Gateway device
	• If it’s behind a NAT device that’s enabled for NAT
	  traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of the NAT device
• Important step: enable Route Propagation for
the Virtual Private Gateway in the route table
that is associated with your subnets
• If you need to ping your EC2 instances from
on-premises, make sure you add the ICMP
protocol on the inbound of your security
groups


AWS VPN CloudHub 
• Provide secure communication between
multiple sites, if you have multiple VPN
connections
• Low -cost hub -and -spoke model for primary or secondary network connectivity
between different locations (VPN only)
• It’s a VPN connection so it goes over the
public Internet
• To set it up, connect multiple VPN
connections on the same VGW, setup
dynamic routing and configure route tables




Direct Connect (DX)
• Provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC
• Dedicated connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct
Connect locations
• You need to setup a Virtual Private Gateway on your VPC
• Access public resources (S3) and private (EC2) on same connection
• Use Cases:
	• Increase bandwidth throughput - working with large data sets – lower cost
	• More consistent network experience - applications using real-time data feeds
	• Hybrid Environments (on prem + cloud)
• Supports both IPv4 and IPv6



Direct Connect – Connection Types
Dedicated Connections: 1Gbps and 10 Gbps capacity
• Physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
• Request made to AWS first, then completed by AWS Direct Connect Partners

Hosted Connections: 50Mbps, 500 Mbps, to 10 Gbps
• Connection requests are made via AWS Direct Connect Partners
• Capacity can be added or removed on demand
• 1, 2, 5, 10 Gbps available at select AWS Direct Connect Partners
• Lead times are often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection



Direct Connect - Resiliency:
High Resiliency for Critical Workloads
One connection at multiple locations

Maximum Resiliency for Critical Workloads
Maximum resilience is achieved by separate connections
terminating on separate devices in more than one location.




AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services):
• Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPC (own or other accounts)
• Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
• Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC) or GWLB
• If the NLB is in multiple AZ, and the ENIs in multiple AZ, the solution is fault tolerant! 



EC2-Classic & AWS ClassicLink (deprecated)
• EC2-Classic: instances run in a single network shared with other customers
• Amazon VPC: your instances run logically isolated to your AWS account
ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic instances to a VPC in your account
• Must associate a security group
• Enables communication using private IPv4 addresses
• Removes the need to make use of public IPv4 addresses or Elastic IP addresses
Likely to be distractors at the exam 


Transit Gateway
• For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and
on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
• Regional resource, can work cross-region
• Share cross-account using Resource Access Manager (RAM)
• You can peer Transit Gateways across regions
• Route Tables: limit which VPC can talk with other VPC
• Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections
• Supports IP Multicast (not supported by any other AWS
service)



Transit Gateway: Site-to-Site VPN ECMP
• ECMP = Equal-cost multi-path
routing
• Routing strategy to allow to
forward a packet over multiple
best path
• Use case: create multiple Siteto-Site VPN connections to
increase the bandwidth of your
connection to AWS

IPv6 Troubleshooting
• IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC
and subnets
• So, if you cannot launch an EC2 instance
in your subnet
	• It’s not because it cannot acquire an IPv6
	(the space is very large)
	• It’s because there are no available IPv4 in
	your subnet
• Solution: create a new IPv4 CIDR in
your subnet



Egress-only Internet Gateway
• Used for IPv6 only
• (similar to a NAT Gateway but for IPv6)
• Allows instances in your VPC outbound
connections over IPv6 while preventing
the internet to initiate an IPv6 connection
to your instances
• You must update the Route Tables



VPC Section Summary:
------------------------------------------------
• CIDR – IP Range
• VPC – Virtual Private Cloud => we define a list of IPv4 & IPv6 CIDR
• Subnets – tied to an AZ, we define a CIDR
• Internet Gateway – at the VPC level, provide IPv4 & IPv6 Internet Access
• Route Tables – must be edited to add routes from subnets to the IGW, VPC Peering Connections, VPC Endpoints, …
• Bastion Host – public EC2 instance to SSH into, that has SSH connectivity to EC2 instances in private subnets
• NAT Instances – gives Internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets. Old, must be setup in a public subnet, disable Source / Destination check flag
• NAT Gateway – managed by AWS, provides scalable Internet access to private EC2 instances, IPv4 only
• Private DNS + Route 53 – enable DNS Resolution + DNS Hostnames (VPC)
NACL – stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound, don’t forget Ephemeral Ports
• Security Groups – stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level
• Reachability Analyzer – perform network connectivity testing between AWS
resources
• VPC Peering – connect two VPCs with non overlapping CIDR, non-transitive
• VPC Endpoints – provide private access to AWS Services (S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, SSM) within a VPC
• VPC Flow Logs – can be setup at the VPC / Subnet / ENI Level, for ACCEPT and REJECT traffic, helps identifying attacks, analyze using Athena or CloudWatch Logs
Insights
• Site-to-Site VPN – setup a Customer Gateway on DC, a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and site-to-site VPN over public Internet
• AWS VPN CloudHub – hub-and-spoke VPN model to connect your sites
Direct Connect – setup a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and establish a direct private connection to an AWS Direct Connect Location
• Direct Connect Gateway – setup a Direct Connect to many VPCs in different AWS regions
• AWS PrivateLink / VPC Endpoint Services:
• Connect services privately from your service VPC to customers VPC
• Doesn’t need VPC Peering, public Internet, NAT Gateway, Route Tables
• Must be used with Network Load Balancer & ENI
• ClassicLink – connect EC2-Classic EC2 instances privately to your VPC
• Transit Gateway – transitive peering connections for VPC, VPN & DX
• Traffic Mirroring – copy network traffic from ENIs for further analysis
• Egress-only Internet Gateway – like a NAT Gateway, but for IPv6



Networking Costs in AWS per GB - Simplified
Use Private IP
instead of Public
IP for good
savings and
better network
performance

Use same AZ for
maximum savings
(at the cost of
high availability)


Minimizing egress traffic network cost
• Egress traffic: outbound
traffic (from AWS to
outside)
• Ingress traffic: inbound
traffic - from outside to
AWS (typically free)
• Try to keep as much
internet traffic within
AWS to minimize costs
• Direct Connect location
that are co-located in
the same AWS Region
result in lower cost for
egress network


S3 Data Transfer Pricing – Analysis for USA
• S3 ingress: free
• S3 to Internet: $0.09 per GB
• S3 Transfer Acceleration:
	• Faster transfer times (50 to 500% better)
	• Additional cost on top of Data Transfer Pricing: +$0.04 to $0.08 per GB
• S3 to CloudFront: $0.00 per GB
• CloudFront to Internet: $0.085 per GB (slightly cheaper than S3)
	• Caching capability (lower latency)
	• Reduce costs associated with S3 Requests
	Pricing (7x cheaper with CloudFront)
• S3 Cross Region Replication: $0.02 per GB\





VP:
==
/28 means 16 IPs (=2^(32-28) = 2^4), means only the last digit can change.

CIDR not should overlap, and the max CIDR size in AWS is /16.

Route tables must be updated in both VPCs that are peered.

You can't create a VPC Peering connection between VPC and on-premises corporate data center. Also, the VPC Peering connection is not transitive.

You have set up a Direct Connect connection between your corporate data center and your VPC A in your AWS account. 
You need to access VPC B in another AWS region from your corporate datacenter as well.
 What should you do?
Ans:This is the main use case of Direct Connect Gateways.


When using VPC Endpoints, what are the only two AWS services that have a Gateway Endpoint available?
S3/DymanoDB
These two services have a VPC Gateway Endpoint (remember it), all the other ones have an 
Interface endpoint (powered by Private Link - means a private IP).

VPC Flow Logs is a VPC feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

Hosted Direct Connect connection supports 50Mbps, 500Mbps, up to 10Gbps.


Allows you to expose a private application to other AWS customers without making the application public to the Internet and without making a VPC Peering connection.
Use VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)

AWS VPN CloudHub allows you to securely communicate with multiple sites using AWS VPN. 
It operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.

##Section 26: Disaster Recovery & Migrations
=================================================
Disaster Recovery Strategies:
• Backup and Restore
• Pilot Light 
• Warm Standby 
• Hot Site / Multi Site Approach



Disaster Recovery Tips:
Backup 
	• EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / Snapshots, etc… 
	• Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication 
	• From On-Premise: Snowball or Storage Gateway 
High Availability 
	• Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region 
	• RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3 
	• Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect 
Replication 
	• RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases 
	• Database replication from on-premises to RDS 
	• Storage Gateway 
Automation 
	• CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment 
	• Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail 
	• AWS Lambda functions for customized automations 
Chaos 
	• Netflix has a “simian-army” randomly terminating EC2




AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):
• Convert your Database’s Schema from one engine to another
• Example OLTP: (SQL Server or Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
• Example OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to Amazon Redshift
• Prefer compute-intensive instances to optimize data conversions
• You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine
	• Ex: On-Premise PostgreSQL => RDS PostgreSQL
	• The DB engine is still PostgreSQL (RDS is the platform)



On-Premise strategy with AWS:
• Ability to download Amazon Linux 2 AMI as a VM (.iso format) 
	• VMWare, KVM, VirtualBox (Oracle VM), Microsoft Hyper-V 
• VM Import / Export 
	• Migrate existing applications into EC2 
	• Create a DR repository strategy for your on-premises VMs 
	• Can export back the VMs from EC2 to on-premises 
• AWS Application Discovery Service 
	• Gather information about your on-premises servers to plan a migration 
	• Server utilization and dependency mappings 
	• Track with AWS Migration Hub 
• AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) 
	• replicate On-premise => AWS , AWS => AWS, AWS => On-premise 
	• Works with various database technologies (Oracle, MySQL, DynamoDB, etc..) 
• AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) 
	• Incremental replication of on-premises live servers to AWS


AWS DataSync
• Move large amount of data from on-premises to AWS
• Can synchronize to: Amazon S3 (any storage classes – including
Glacier), Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre...)
• Move data from your NAS or file system via NFS or SMB
• Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
• Leverage the DataSync agent to connect to your systems
• Can setup a bandwidth limit




Transferring large amount of data into AWS:
• Example: transfer 200 TB of data in the cloud. We have a 100 Mbps internet connection.
• Over the internet / Site-to-Site VPN:
	• Immediate to setup
	• Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*1000(MB)*8(Mb)/100 Mbps = 16,000,000s = 185d
• Over direct connect 1Gbps:
	• Long for the one-time setup (over a month)
	• Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*8(Gb)/1 Gbps = 1,600,000s = 18.5d
• Over Snowball:
	• Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel
	• Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transfer
	• Can be combined with DMS
• For on-going replication / transfers: Site-to-Site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync





AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between 
on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services.


AWS Backup enables you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services. 
It helps you support your regulatory compliance or business policies for data protection.

AWS CodeCommit->AWS CodeBuild->AWS Elastic Beanstalk
GitHub
Or 3rd party
code repository

Jenkins CI
Or 3rd party CI servers

AWS CodeDeploy
User Managed
EC2 Instances
Fleet
(CloudFormation)


What is CloudFormation:
• CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS
Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
• For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
	• I want a security group
	• I want two EC2 machines using this security group
	• I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
	• I want an S3 bucket
	• I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
• Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the
exact configuration that you specify


Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (1/2):

nfrastructure as code
• No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
• The code can be version controlled for example using git
• Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code

Cost
• Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how
much a stack costs you
• You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
• Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and
recreated at 8 AM, safely

Productivity
• Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
• Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
• Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)

Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex:
• VPC stacks
• Network stacks
• App stacks

Don’t re-invent the wheel
• Leverage existing templates on the web!
• Leverage the documentation


How CloudFormation Works:
• Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in
CloudFormation
• To update a template, we can’t edit previous ones. We have to reupload a new version of the template to AWS
• Stacks are identified by a name
• Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by
CloudFormation.

##FAQ
================================================= 


#Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling FAQs:
-------------------------------------------------
1)Q. Is there a limit on how large or small a subnet can be?\
The minimum size of a subnet is a /28 (or 14 IP addresses.) for IPv4. Subnets cannot be larger than the VPC in which they are created.
For IPv6, the subnet size is fixed to be a /64. Only one IPv6 CIDR block can be allocated to a subnet.

2)Q. How large of a VPC can I create?
Currently, Amazon VPC supports five (5) IP address ranges, one (1) primary and four (4) secondary for IPv4. 
Each of these ranges can be between /28 (in CIDR notation) and /16 in size. The IP address ranges of your 
VPC should not overlap with the IP address ranges of your existing network.
For IPv6, the VPC is a fixed size of /56 (in CIDR notation). A VPC can have both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks associated to it.





21) How is AWS CloudFormation different from AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Here are some differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
AWS CloudFormation helps you provision and describe all of the infrastructure resources that are present in your cloud environment. 
On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.

AWS CloudFormation supports the infrastructure needs of various types of applications, like legacy applications and 
existing enterprise applications. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to
help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.



22) What are the elements of an AWS CloudFormation template?
AWS CloudFormation templates are YAML or JSON formatted text files that are comprised of five essential elements, they are:
-Template parameters
-Output values
-Data tables
-Resources
-File format versi


23) What happens when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?
If the resource in the stack cannot be created, then the CloudFormation automatically rolls back and terminates all the 
resources that were created in the CloudFormation template. This is a handy feature 
when you accidentally exceed your limit of Elastic IP addresses or don’t have access to an EC2 AMI.



23) What Is Identity and Access Management (IAM) and How Is It Used?
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. 
IAM lets you manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which 
AWS resources users and applications can access.




24) What are the policies that you can set for your users’ passwords?
Here are some of the policies that you can set:
You can set a minimum length of the password, or you can ask the users to add at least one number or special characters in it.
You can assign requirements of particular character types, including uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
You can enforce automatic password expiration, prevent reuse of old passwords, and request for a password 
reset upon their next AWS sign in.
You can have the AWS users contact an account administrator when the user has allowed the password to expire. 



25) Can AWS Config aggregate data across different AWS accounts?
Yes, you can set up AWS Config to deliver configuration updates from different accounts to one S3 bucket, 
once the appropriate IAM policies are applied to the S3 bucket.



26) What happens to my Amazon EC2 instances if I delete my ASG?
If you have an EC2 Auto Scaling group (ASG) with running instances and you choose to delete the ASG, the instances will be 
terminated and the ASG will be deleted.



27) How do I know when EC2 Auto Scaling is launching or terminating the EC2 instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group?
When you use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale your applications automatically, 
it is useful to know when EC2 Auto Scaling is launching or terminating the EC2 instances in your EC2 Auto Scaling group. 
Amazon SNS coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of notifications to subscribing clients or endpoints. 



28) What is a launch configuration?
A launch configuration is a template that an EC2 Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances.
You can specify your launch configuration with multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups. However, you can only specify one launch configuration 
for an EC2 Auto Scaling group at a time, and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it. 

Therefore, if you want to change the launch configuration for your EC2 Auto Scaling group, 
you must create a launch configuration and then update your EC2 Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration. 

When you change the launch configuration for your EC2 Auto Scaling group, any new instances are launched using the new 
configuration parameters, but existing instances are not affected. You can see the launch configurations section of the 
EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide for more details.



29) What happens if a scaling activity causes me to reach my Amazon EC2 limit of instances?
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cannot scale past the Amazon EC2 limit of instances that you can run. 
If you need more Amazon EC2 instances, complete the Amazon EC2 instance request form.



30) Can EC2 Auto Scaling groups span multiple AWS regions?
EC2 Auto Scaling groups are regional constructs. They can span Availability Zones, but not AWS regions.



31) How can I implement changes across multiple instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group?
You can use AWS CodeDeploy or CloudFormation to orchestrate code changes to multiple instances in your EC2 Auto Scaling group.



32) If I have data installed in an EC2 Auto Scaling group, and a new instance is dynamically created later, is the data copied over to the new instances?
Data is not automatically copied from existing instances to new instances. You can use lifecycle hooks to copy the data, or an Amazon RDS database including replicas.



33) When I create an EC2 Auto Scaling group from an existing instance, does it create a new AMI (Amazon Machine Image)?
When you create an Auto Scaling group from an existing instance, it does not create a new AMI. 



34) What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks let you take action before an instance goes into service or before it gets terminated. 
This can be especially useful if you are not baking your software environment into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). 



35) Which health check type should I select?
If you are using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) with your group, you should select an ELB health check. 
If you’re not using ELB with your group, you should select the EC2 health check.



36) How do I control which instances Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates when scaling in, and how do I protect data on an instance?
You can configure this through the use of a termination policy. You can also use instance protection to prevent 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from selecting specific instances for termination when scaling in. 

If you have data on an instance, 
and you need that data to be persistent even if your instance is scaled in, then you can use a service like S3, RDS, or DynamoDB, 
to make sure that it is stored off the instance.



37) How long is the turn-around time for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to spin up a new instance at inService state after 
detecting an unhealthy server?
The turnaround time is within minutes. The majority of replacements happen within less than 5 minutes, and on average 
it is significantly less than 5 minutes. It depends on a variety of factors, including how long it takes to boot up the AMI 
of your instance.



38) If Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) determines that an instance is unhealthy, and moved offline, 
will the previous requests sent to the failed instance be queued and rerouted to other instances within the group?

When ELB notices that the instance is unhealthy, it will stop routing requests to it. 
However, prior to discovering that the instance is unhealthy, some requests to that instance will fail.


39) If you don’t use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) how would users be directed to the other servers in a group if there was a failure?
You can integrate with Route53 (which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not currently support out of the box, but many customers use).
You can also use your own reverse proxy, or for internal microservices, can use service discovery solutions.


================================================= 
#Security:
================================================= 

40) Are CloudWatch agents automatically installed on EC2 instances when you create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group?
If your AMI contains a CloudWatch agent, it’s automatically installed on EC2 instances when you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. With the stock Amazon Linux AMI, you need to install it (recommended, via yum).


Cost Optimization:
=================

41) Can I create a single ASG to scale instances across different purchase options?
Yes. You can provision and automatically scale EC2 capacity across different EC2 instance types, Availability Zones, and On-Demand, RIs and Spot purchase options in a single Auto Scaling Group. 


42)Can I use ASGs to launch and manage just Spot Instances or just On-Demand instances and RIs?
Yes. You can configure your ASG specifying all capacity to be only Spot instances or all capacity to be only On-Demand instances and RIs.


43) Can I specify instances of different sizes (CPU cores, memory) in my Auto Scaling group?
Yes. You can specify any instance type available in a region. Additionally, you can specify an optional weight for each instance type, which defines the capacity units that each instance would contribute to your application’s performance.


44) What are the costs for using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling fleet managment for EC2 instances carries no additional fees. The dynamic scaling capabilities of 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling are enabled by Amazon CloudWatch and also carry no additional fees. 
Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudWatch service fees apply and are billed separately.

3) What is the difference between Amazon ECR public and private repositories?
A private repository does not offer content search capabilities and requires Amazon IAM-based authentication using 
AWS account credentials before allowing images to be pulled. A public repository has descriptive content and allows 
anyone anywhere to pull images without needing an AWS account or using IAM credentials. Public repository 
images are also available in the Amazon ECR public gallery.


4) What compliance capabilities can I enable on Amazon ECR?
You can use AWS CloudTrail on Amazon ECR to provide a history of all API actions such as who pulled an image and 
when tags were moved between images. Administrators can also find which EC2 instances pulled which images.


5) Can I access Amazon ECR inside a VPC?
Yes. You can set up AWS PrivateLink endpoints to allow your instances to pull images from your private repositories without traversing through the public internet.


6)Does Amazon ECR work with AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Yes. AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports Amazon ECR for both single and multi-container Docker environments, allowing you to easily 
deploy container images stored in Amazon ECR with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. All you need to do is specify the 
Amazon ECR repository in your Dockerrun.aws.json configuration and attach the 
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly policy to your container instance role.


7) Does Amazon ECR scan container images for vulnerabilities?
You can enable Amazon ECR to automatically scan your container images for a broad range of operating system vulnerabilities. 
You can also scan images using an API command, and Amazon ECR will notify you over API and in the console when a scan completes. 
For enhanced image scanning, you can turn on Amazon Inspector.

================================================= 
AWS Outposts FAQ:
================================================= 

Why would I use AWS Outposts rack instead of operating in an AWS Region?

You can use Outposts rack to support your applications that have low latency or local data processing requirements. 
These applications may need to generate near real-time responses to end user applications or need to communicate with other 
on-premises systems or control on-site equipment. These can include workloads running on factory floors for automated operations in 
manufacturing, real-time patient diagnosis or medical imaging, and content and media streaming. You can use Outposts rack to securely 
store and process customer data that needs to remain on premises or in countries where there is no AWS Region. You can run data intensive 
workloads on Outposts rack and process data locally when transmitting data to AWS Regions is expensive and 
wasteful and for better control on data analysis, backup and restore.

To access your file system, mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 Linux-based instance using the standard Linux mount command and the 
 system’s DNS name. To simplify accessing your Amazon EFS file systems, we recommend using the Amazon EFS mount helper utility. 
 Once mounted, you can work with the files and directories in your file system just like you would with a local file system.
EFS uses the Network File System version 4 (NFS v4) protocol. For a step-by-step example of how to access a file system from an 
EC2 instance, see the guide here.



3)What is an Amazon EFS Access Point?
Amazon EFS Access Points simplify providing applications with access to shared datasets in an Amazon EFS file system. 
Amazon EFS Access Points work together with AWS IAM and enforce an operating system user and group, and a directory for every file 
system request made through the access point. You can create multiple access points per file system and use them to provide access 
to specific applications.



4)How do I access an Amazon EFS file system from servers in my on-premises datacenter?
To access Amazon EFS file systems from on premises, you must have an AWS Direct Connect or 
AWS VPN connection between your on-premises datacenter and your Amazon VPC.
You mount an Amazon EFS file system on your on-premises Linux server using the standard Linux mount command for mounting a file system 
using the NFS v4.1 protocol.

You can access your Amazon EFS file system concurrently from servers in your on-premises datacenter as well as Amazon EC2 instances in your Amazon VPC.


5)How much does Amazon EFS cost?

With Amazon EFS, you pay only for what you use per month.
When using the Provisioned Throughput mode, you pay for the throughput you provision per month. 
There is no minimum fee and no setup charges.

You specify an AWS Region when you create your Amazon S3 bucket. For S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Glacier 
Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, your objects are automatically stored 
across multiple devices spanning a minimum of three Availability Zones, each separated by miles across an AWS Region. Objects stored 
in the S3 One Zone-IA storage class are stored redundantly within a single Availability Zone in the AWS Region you select. 
For S3 on Outposts, your data is stored in your Outpost on-premises environment, unless you manually choose to transfer it to an 
AWS Region. Please refer to Regional Products and Services for details of Amazon S3 service availability by AWS Region.


3)How much does Amazon S3 cost?

Amazon S3 bucket. S3 Transfer Acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed AWS Edge Locations. 
As data arrives at an AWS Edge Location, data is routed to your Amazon S3 bucket over an optimized network path.


6)How secure is my data in Amazon S3?     
Amazon S3 is secure by default. Upon creation, only you have access to Amazon S3 buckets that you create, 
and you have complete control over who has access to your data. Amazon S3 supports user authentication to control access to data. 
You can use access control mechanisms such as bucket policies to selectively grant permissions to users and groups of users. 
The Amazon S3 console highlights your publicly accessible buckets, indicates the source of public accessibility, and also warns 
you if changes to your bucket policies or bucket ACLs would make your bucket publicly accessible. You should enable Block Public 
Access for all accounts and buckets that you do not want publicly accessible. 

You can securely upload/download your data to Amazon S3 via SSL endpoints using the HTTPS protocol. 
If you need extra security you can use the Server-Side Encryption (SSE) option to encrypt data stored at rest. 
You can configure your Amazon S3 buckets to automatically encrypt objects before storing them if the incoming storage 
requests do not have any encryption information. Alternatively, you can use your own encryption libraries to encrypt data before 
storing it in Amazon S3.



7)What is S3 Select?
S3 Select is an Amazon S3 feature that makes it easy to retrieve specific data from the contents of an object using simple 
SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object. S3 Select simplifies and improves the performance of scanning and 
filtering the contents of objects into a smaller, targeted dataset by up to 400%. With S3 Select, you can also perform operational 
investigations on log files in Amazon S3 without the need to operate or manage a compute cluster.

A backup plan is a policy expression that defines when and how you want to back up your AWS resources, such as DynamoDB tables or 
EFS file systems. You assign resources to backup plans and AWS Backup will then automatically make and retain backups for those 
resources according to the backup plan. Backup plans are composed of one or more backup rules. Each backup rule is composed of 
1) a backup schedule, which includes the backup frequency (Recovery Point Objective - RPO) and backup window, 
2) a lifecycle rule that specifies when to transition a backup from one storage tier to another and when to expire the recovery point, 
3) the backup vault in which to place the created recovery points, and 
4) the tags to be added to backups upon creation. For example, a backup plan might have a “daily backup rule” and a “monthly backup rule.”
 The daily rule backs up resources every day at midnight and retains the backups for one month. 
 The monthly rule takes a backup once a month on the beginning of every month and retains the backups for one year.

AWS Transfer Family supports multiple protocols for business-to-business (B2B) file transfers so data can easily and securely be 
exchanged across stakeholders, third-party vendors, business partners, or customers. Without using Transfer Family, 
you have to host and manage your own file transfer service which requires you to invest in operating and managing infrastructure, 
patching servers, monitoring for uptime and availability, and building one-off mechanisms to provision users and audit their activity. 


2) How do I get started with AWS Transfer for SFTP, FTPS, and FTP?
In 3 simple steps, you get an always-on server endpoint enabled for SFTP, FTPS, and/or FTP. First, you select the protocol(s) 
you want to enable your end users to connect to your endpoint. Next, you configure user access using AWS Transfer 
Family built-in authentication manager (service managed), Microsoft Active Directory (AD), or by integrating your own or a 
third party identity provider such as Okta or Microsoft AzureAD (“BYO” authentication). Finally, select the server to access 
S3 buckets or EFS file systems. Once the protocol(s), identity provider, and the access to file systems are enabled, 
your users can continue to use their existing SFTP, FTPS, or FTP clients and configurations, 
while the data accessed is stored in the chosen file systems.


3)Which protocols should I use for securing data while in-transit over a public network?
Either SFTP or FTPS should be used for secure transfers over public networks. 
Due to the underlying security of the protocols based on SSH and TLS cryptographic algorithms, 
data and commands are transferred through a secure, encrypted channel.


4) How am I billed for use of the service?
You are billed on an hourly basis for each of the protocols enabled, from the time you create and configure your server endpoint, 
until the time you delete it. You are also billed based on the amount of data uploaded and downloaded over 
SFTP, FTPS, or FTP and number of messages exchanged over AS2.

================================================= 
Amazon VPC FAQs:
================================================= 

1)Why should I use Amazon VPC?
Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud - no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required. 
You can define your own network space, and control how your network and the Amazon EC2 resources inside 
your network are exposed to the Internet. You can also leverage the enhanced security options in 
Amazon VPC to provide more granular access to and from the Amazon EC2 instances in your virtual network.



2)What are the components of Amazon VPC?
-A Virtual Private Cloud: A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. 
You define a VPC’s IP address space from ranges you select.

-Subnet: A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.

-Internet Gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.

-NAT Gateway: A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your 
resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.

-Virtual private gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.

-Peering Connection: A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs.

-VPC Endpoints: Enables private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your 
VPC without using an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies.

A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect to other services in AWS. These endpoints include gateway endpoints, 
interface endpoints, and load balancer endpoints.
AWS VPC endpoints allow you to connect to S3 (for instance) from your network without the use of the 
internet (internet gateway, NAT gateway).


-Egress-only Internet Gateway: A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.


3) How will I be charged and billed for my use of Amazon VPC?
There are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC itself. 
If you connect your VPC to your corporate datacenter using the optional hardware VPN connection, pricing is per VPN connection-hour 
(the amount of time you have a VPN connection in the "available" state.) Partial hours are billed as full hours. 
Data transferred over VPN connections will be charged at standard AWS Data Transfer rates.


4)What are the connectivity options for my Amazon VPC?
-The internet (via an internet gateway)
-Your corporate data center using an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection (via the virtual private gateway)
-Both the internet and your corporate data center (utilizing both an internet gateway and a virtual private gateway)
-Other AWS services (via internet gateway, NAT, virtual private gateway, or VPC endpoints)
-Other Amazon VPCs (via VPC peering connections)


5) When is an IP address considered a Public IP address?
Any IP address that is assigned to an instance or a service hosted in a VPC that can be accessed over the internet is considered a 
public IP address. Only public IPv4 addresses, including Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) and IPv6 GUA can be routable on the internet. 
To do so, you would need to first connect the VPC to the internet and then update the route table to 
make them reachable to/from the internet.


6)How do instances without public IP addresses access the Internet?
Instances without public IP addresses can access the Internet in one of two ways:
Instances without public IP addresses can route their traffic through a NAT gateway or a NAT instance to access the Internet. 
These instances use the public IP address of the NAT gateway or NAT instance to traverse the Internet. 
The NAT gateway or NAT instance allows outbound communication but doesn’t allow machines on the Internet to initiate a 
connection to the privately addressed instances.

For VPCs with a hardware VPN connection or Direct Connect connection, instances can route their Internet traffic down the 
virtual private gateway to your existing datacenter. From there, it can access the Internet via your existing egress points 
and network security/monitoring devices.


7)Can I connect to my VPC using a software VPN?
Yes. You may use a third-party software VPN to create a site to site or remote access 
VPN connection with your VPC via the Internet gateway.



8)Does traffic go over the internet when two instances communicate using public IP addresses, or when instances 
communicate with a public AWS service endpoint?
No. When using public IP addresses, all communication between instances and services hosted in AWS use AWS's private network. 
Packets that originate from the AWS network with a destination on the AWS network stay on the AWS global network, except 
traffic to or from AWS China Regions.
 
In addition, all data flowing across the AWS global network that interconnects our data centers and Regions is 
automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. 
Additional encryption layers exist as well; for example, all VPC cross-region peering traffic, 
and customer or service-to-service Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections. 


9)What IP address ranges are assigned to a default Amazon VPC?
Default VPCs are assigned a CIDR range of 172.31.0.0/16. Default subnets within a default VPC are assigned /20 
netblocks within the VPC CIDR range. 



10)How large of a VPC can I create?
Currently, Amazon VPC supports five (5) IP address ranges, one (1) primary and four (4) secondary for IPv4. 
Each of these ranges can be between /28 (in CIDR notation) and /16 in size. 
The IP address ranges of your VPC should not overlap with the IP address ranges of your existing network.
For IPv6, the VPC is a fixed size of /56 (in CIDR notation). A VPC can have both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks associated to it.



11)Is there a limit on how large or small a subnet can be?
The minimum size of a subnet is a /28 (or 14 IP addresses.) for IPv4. Subnets cannot be larger than the VPC in which they are created.
For IPv6, the subnet size is fixed to be a /64. Only one IPv6 CIDR block can be allocated to a subnet.


12)Can I assign any IP address to an instance?
You can assign any IP address to your instance as long as it is:
Part of the associated subnet's IP address range
Not reserved by Amazon for IP networking purposes
Not currently assigned to another interfac
Not currently assigned to another interfac




13)Can I assign multiple IP addresses to an instance?
Yes. You can assign one or more secondary private IP addresses to an Elastic Network Interface or an EC2 instance in Amazon VPC. 
The number of secondary private IP addresses you can assign depends on the instance type. 


14) Can I monitor the network traffic in my VPC?
Yes. You can use Amazon VPC traffic mirroring and Amazon VPC flow logs features to monitor the network traffic in your Amazon VPC.

VPC flow logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. 
Flow logs data can be published to either Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3.


15)What is Amazon VPC traffic mirroring?
Amazon VPC traffic mirroring makes it easy for customers to replicate network traffic to and from an 
Amazon EC2 instance and forward it to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for use-cases such as content inspection, 
threat monitoring, and troubleshooting. 



16)Can a VPC span multiple Availability Zones?
Yes. 


17) Can a subnet span Availability Zones?
No. A subnet must reside within a single Availability Zone.


18)Am I charged for network bandwidth between instances in different subnets?
If the instances reside in subnets in different Availability Zones, you will be charged $0.01 per GB for data transfer.



19)What are instance hostnames?
When you launch an instance, it is assigned a hostname. There are two options available, an IP based name or a Resource based name, 
and this parameter is configurable at instance launch. 
The IP based name uses a form of the Private IPv4 address while the Resource based name uses a form of the instance-id.

 you can change the hostname of an instance form IP based to 
 Resource based or vice versa by stopping the instance and then changing the resource based naming options.
 the instance hostname can be used as DNS hostnames.



20)What is AWS PrivateLink?
AWS PrivateLink enables customers to access services hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, 
while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network.



21)How many VPCs, subnets,  es, and internet gateways can I create?

Five Amazon VPCs per AWS account per region
Two hundred subnets per Amazon VPC
Five Amazon VPC Elastic IP addresses per AWS account per region
One internet gateway per Amazon VPC

================================================= 
AWS Direct Connect FAQs:
================================================= 

What is AWS Direct Connect?
AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS. 
Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a 
private network connection between your facilities and AWS. In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, 
increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. All AWS services, including 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and 
Amazon DynamoDB can be used with AWS Direct Connect.



2)What is an AWS Direct Connect gateway?
An AWS Direct Connect gateway is a grouping of virtual private gateways (VGWs) and private virtual interfaces (VIFs). 
An AWS Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. You can create the AWS Direct Connect gateway in any 
Region and access it from all other Regions. 


3)What is a virtual interface (VIF)?

A virtual interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, and is either public or private. 
A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3. A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC. 


4) What is a virtual private gateway (VGW)?
A virtual private gateway (VGW) is part of a VPC that provides edge routing for AWS managed VPN connections and AWS 
Direct Connect connections. You associate an AWS Direct Connect gateway with the virtual private gateway for the VPC. 


5)What is AWS Direct Connect SiteLink?
When the AWS Direct Connect SiteLink feature is enabled at two or more AWS Direct Connect locations, 
you can send data between those locations, bypassing AWS Regions. 
AWS Direct Connect SiteLink works with both hosted and dedicated connections.


6)How will I be charged and billed for my use of AWS Direct Connect?
AWS Direct Connect has two separate charges: port hours and data transfer. Pricing is per port-hour consumed for each port type. 
Partial port hours consumed are billed as full hours. The account that owns the port will be charged the port hour charges.
Data transfer through AWS Direct Connect will be billed in the same month in which the usage occurred.



7)How does AWS Direct Connect differ from an IPsec VPN Connection?
VPN connections use IPsec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and an Amazon VPC over the public internet. 
VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest 
bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability of internet-based connectivity. AWS Direct Connect bypasses 
the internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your network and AWS.



8)Does MACsec replace other encryption technologies I currently use in my network?
MACsec is not intended as a replacement for any specific encryption technology. For simplicity, and for defense in depth,
you should continue to use any encryption technologies that you already use. We offer MACsec as an encryption option you can 
integrate into your network in addition to other encryption technologies you currently use.



================================================= 
Elastic Load Balancing FAQs:
================================================= 

1)How do I decide which load balancer to select for my application?
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) supports four types of load balancers. 
You can select the appropriate load balancer based on your application needs. 
If you need to load balance HTTP requests, we recommend you use the Application Load Balancer (ALB). 
For network/transport protocols (layer4 – TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance/low latency 
applications we recommend using Network Load Balancer. If your application is built within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) 
Classic network, you should use Classic Load Balancer. If you need to deploy and run 
third-party virtual appliances, you can use Gateway Load Balancer.


2)Can Network Load Balancer process both TCP and UDP protocol traffic on the same port?
Yes. To achieve this, you can use a TCP+UDP listener. For example, for a DNS service using both TCP and UDP, 
you can create a TCP+UDP listener on port 53, and the load balancer will process traffic for both UDP and TCP requests on that port. 
You must associate a TCP+UDP listener with a TCP+UDP target group.



3) How does Gateway Load Balancer pricing work?
You are charged for each hour or partial hour that a Gateway Load Balancer is running and the number of Load Balancer 
Capacity Units (LCU) used by Gateway Load Balancer per hour.



================================================= 
Amazon Athena FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is Amazon Athena?
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. 
Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing data immediately. 
You don’t even need to load your data into Athena, it works directly with data stored in S3. To get started, 
just log into the Athena Management Console, define your schema, and start querying. 

Amazon Athena uses Presto with full standard SQL support and works with a variety of standard data formats, 
including CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet. Athena can handle complex analysis, including large joins, window functions, and arrays. 



2)How do you access Amazon Athena?
Amazon Athena can be accessed via the AWS Management Console, an API, or an ODBC or JDBC driver. 
You can programmatically run queries, add tables or partitions using the ODBC or JDBC driver.



3) What is federated query?
If you have data in sources other than Amazon S3, you can use Athena to query the data in place or build pipelines that extract 
data from multiple data sources and store them in Amazon S3. With Athena Federated Query, you can run SQL queries across data 
stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources.


4)How is Amazon Athena priced?
Amazon Athena is priced per query and charges based on the amount of data scanned by the query. 
You can store data in a variety of formats on Amazon S3. If you compress your data, partition, 
or convert it to columnar storage formats, you pay less because you scan less data. 
Converting data to the columnar format allows Athena to read only the columns it needs to process the query.

No, you are not charged for failed queries.
Amazon Athena queries data directly from Amazon S3, so your source data is billed at S3 rates. When Amazon Athena runs a query, 
it stores the results in an S3 bucket of your choice and you are billed at standard S3 rates for these result sets.

#Security, Identity, & Compliance
=================================================



AWS Identity and Access Management FAQ:
======================================

1) What is AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
IAM provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. With IAM, you can control access to services and resources under specific 
conditions. 
IAM provides authentication and authorization for AWS services. A service evaluates if an AWS request is allowed or denied. 
Access is denied by default and is allowed only when a policy explicitly grants access. You can attach policies to roles and 
resources to control access across AWS.


2)What are IAM roles and how do they work?
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles provide a way to access AWS by relying on temporary security credentials. 
Each role has a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, and a role is not associated with a specific user or group. 
Instead, trusted entities such as identity providers or AWS services assume roles.



3)What are IAM policies?
IAM policies define permissions for the entities you attach them to. For example, to grant access to an IAM role, 
attach a policy to the role. The permissions defined in the policy determine whether requests are allowed or denied. 
You also can attach policies to some resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets, to grant direct, cross-account access.



4)What are customer managed policies and when should I use them?
To grant only the permissions required to perform tasks, you can create customer managed policies that are specific to your use 
cases and resources. Use customer managed policies to continue refining permissions for your specific requirements.


5)What are inline policies and when should I use them?
Inline policies are embedded in and inherent to specific IAM roles. Use inline policies if you want to maintain a strict 
one-to-one relationship between a policy and the identity to which it is applied. 
For example, you can grant administrative permissions to ensure they are not attached to other roles. 


6)What are resource-based policies and when should I use them?
Resource-based policies are permissions policies that are attached to resources. For example, you can attach resource-based policies 
to Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SQS queues, VPC endpoints, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys. 
For a list of services that support resource-based policies, see AWS services that work with IAM. 
Use resource-based policies to grant direct, cross-account access. 
With resource-based policies, you can define who has access to a resource and which actions they can perform with it.



AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On) FAQs:
==============================================================

1) What is AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)?
IAM Identity Center is built on top of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to simplify access management to multiple AWS accounts, 
AWS applications, and other SAML-enabled cloud applications. In IAM Identity Center, you create, or connect, 
your workforce users for use across AWS. You can choose to manage access just to your AWS accounts, just to your cloud applications, 
or to both. You can create users directly in IAM Identity Center, or you can bring them from your existing workforce directory. 
With IAM Identity Center, you get a unified administration experience to define, customize, and assign fine-grained access. 
Your workforce users get a user portal to access their assigned AWS accounts or cloud applications.

Amazon Cognito FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is Amazon Cognito?
Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. 
Amazon Cognito also enables you to authenticate users through an external identity provider and provides 
temporary security credentials to access your app’s backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway. 
Amazon Cognito works with external identity providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect, social 
identity providers (such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon) and you can also integrate your own identity provider.



2)What is a User Pool?
A User Pool is your user directory that you can configure for your web and mobile apps. 
A User Pool securely stores your users’ profile attributes. You can create and manage a 
User Pool using the AWS console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK.


3)What are unauthenticated users?
Unauthenticated users are users who do not authenticate with any identity provider, but instead access your app as a guest. 
You can define a separate IAM role for these users to provide limited permissions to access your backend resources.


4)How much does Cognito Identity cost?
With Amazon Cognito, you pay only for what you use. There are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.
If you are using the Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only. 
A user is counted as a MAU if, within a calendar month, there is an identity operation related to that user, such as sign-up, 
sign-in, token refresh, password change, or a user account attribute is updated. You are not charged for subsequent sessions or 
for inactive users with in that calendar month. Separate charges apply for optional use of SMS messaging as described below.



================================================= 
AWS Directory Service FAQ:
================================================= 

1)What can I do with AWS Directory Service?

provide single sign-on to applications and services, create and apply group policy, join Amazon EC2 instances to a domain, 
as well as simplify the deployment and management of cloud-based Linux and Microsoft Windows workloads. 
AWS Directory Service enables your end users to use their existing corporate credentials when accessing AWS applications, 
such as Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs and Amazon WorkMail, as well as directory-aware Microsoft workloads, 
including custom .NET and SQL Server-based applications. Finally, you can use your existing corporate credentials to 
administer AWS resources via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role-based access to the AWS Management Console, 
so you do not need to build out more identity federation infrastructure.


2)How do I create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory?
You can launch the AWS Directory Service console from the AWS Management Console to create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. 
Alternatively, you can use the AWS SDK or AWS CLI.

================================================= 
Amazon MQ FAQs
================================================= 

1) What is Amazon MQ?
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message 
brokers in the cloud. You get direct access to the ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ consoles and industry standard APIs and protocols for 
messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP 1.0 and 0.9.1, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. You can easily move from any message 
broker that uses these standards to Amazon MQ because you don’t have to rewrite any messaging code in your applications.



2)Who should use Amazon MQ?
Amazon MQ is suitable for enterprise IT pros, developers, and architects who are managing a message broker themselves–whether 
on-premises or in the cloud–and want to move to a fully managed cloud service without rewriting the messaging code in their applications.


3)Who should use Amazon MQ?
Amazon MQ is suitable for enterprise IT pros, developers, and architects who are managing a message broker themselves–whether 
on-premises or in the cloud–and want to move to a fully managed cloud service without rewriting the messaging code in their applications.

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) - create and control the keys used to encrypt your data




================================================= 
Amazon SQS FAQs:
================================================= 

1) How is Amazon SQS different from Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)?
Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, 
eliminating the need to periodically check or “poll” for updates. Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed 
applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components. 



2)How is Amazon SQS different from Amazon MQ?
If you're using messaging with existing applications, and want to move your messaging to the cloud quickly and easily, 
we recommend you consider Amazon MQ. 
It supports industry-standard APIs and protocols so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to 
Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code in your applications. If you are building brand new applications in the cloud, 
we recommend you consider Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS. Amazon SQS and SNS are lightweight, fully managed message queue and topic 
services that scale almost infinitely and provide simple, easy-to-use APIs.



3)How is Amazon SQS different from Amazon Kinesis Streams?
Amazon SQS offers a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. 
It moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components. 
Amazon SQS provides common middleware constructs such as dead-letter queues and poison-pill management. 
It also provides a generic web services API and can be accessed by any programming language that the AWS SDK supports. 
Amazon SQS supports both standard and FIFO queues.

Amazon Kinesis Streams allows real-time processing of streaming big data and the ability to read and replay records to multiple 
Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same 
record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications that read from the same 
Amazon Kinesis stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).


4)How much does Amazon SQS cost?

You pay only for what you use, and there is no minimum fee.
The cost of Amazon SQS is calculated per request, plus data transfer charges for data transferred out of 
Amazon SQS (unless data is transferred to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 
instances or to AWS Lambda functions within the same region). 



5)Can I use Amazon SQS with other AWS services?
Yes. You can make your applications more flexible and scalable by using Amazon SQS with compute services such as 
Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and AWS Lambda, as well as with storage and database services such as 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.


6) What is Amazon SQS long polling?
Amazon SQS long polling is a way to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queues. 
While the regular short polling returns immediately, even if the message queue being polled is empty, 
long polling doesn’t return a response until a message arrives in the message queue, 
or the long poll times out.

Long polling makes it inexpensive to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queue as soon as the messages are available. 
Using long polling might reduce the cost of using SQS, because you can reduce the number of empty receives



7) How does Amazon SQS handle messages that can't be processed?
In Amazon SQS, you can use the API or the console to configure dead letter queues, which receive messages from other source queues. 
When configuring a dead letter queue, you are required to set appropriate permissions for the dead letter queue 
redrive using RedriveAllowPolicy.
RedriveAllowPolicy includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue redrive permission. 
It defines which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object.
Once you make a dead letter queue, it receives messages after a maximum number of processing attempts cannot be completed. You can use dead letter queues to isolate messages that can't be processed for later analysis.



8) What is a visibility timeout?
The visibility timeout is a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consuming components 
from receiving and processing a message.



9)What are message groups?
Messages are grouped into distinct, ordered "bundles" within a FIFO queue. For each message group ID, all messages are sent and 
received in strict order. However, messages with different message group ID values might be sent and received out of order. 
You must associate a message group ID with a message. If you don't provide a message group ID, the action fails.

If multiple hosts (or different threads on the same host) send messages with the same message group ID are sent to a FIFO queue, 
Amazon SQS delivers the messages in the order in which they arrive for processing. 
To ensure that Amazon SQS preserves the order in which messages are sent and received, ensure that multiple senders send each 
message with a unique message group ID.



================================================= 
Amazon SNS FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)?
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from 
the cloud. It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective capability to publish messages 
from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications. 

It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon SNS follows the “publish-subscribe” (pub-sub) messaging paradigm,
 with notifications being delivered to clients using a “push” mechanism that eliminates the need to 
 periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates. 
 
With simple APIs requiring minimal up-front development effort, 
 no maintenance or management overhead and pay-as-you-go pricing, Amazon SNS gives developers an easy mechanism to 
 incorporate a powerful notification system with their applications.


2)What are the benefits of using Amazon SNS?
Instantaneous, push-based delivery (no polling)
Simple APIs and easy integration with applications
Flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
Inexpensive, pay-as-you-go model with no up-front costs
Web-based AWS Management Console offers the simplicity of a point-and-click interface



3)What are some example uses for Amazon SNS notifications?
The Amazon SNS service can support a wide variety of needs including event notification, monitoring applications, 
workflow systems, time-sensitive information updates, mobile applications, and any other application that generates or 
consumes notifications. 

For example, Amazon SNS can be used in workflow systems to relay events among distributed computer 
applications, move data between data stores or update records in business systems. Event updates and notifications 
concerning validation, approval, inventory changes and shipment status are immediately delivered to relevant system components as 
well as end-users. A common pattern is to use SNS to publish messages to Amazon SQS message queues to reliably send messages to one or 
many system components asynchronously. 

Another example use for Amazon SNS is to relay time-critical events to mobile applications and 
devices. Since Amazon SNS is both highly reliable and scalable, it provides significant advantages to developers who build 
applications that rely on real-time events.


4)How much does Amazon SNS cost?
With Amazon SNS, there is no minimum fee and you pay only for what you use. Users pay $0.50 per 1 million 
Amazon SNS Requests, $0.06 per 100,000 notification deliveries over HTTP, and $2.00 per 100,000 notification deliveries over email. 
For SMS messaging, charges vary by destination country.


5) Are there quotas for the number of topics or number of subscribers per topic?
By default, SNS offers 10 million subscriptions per topic, and 100,000 topics per account.



================================================= 
Amazon SWF FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is Amazon SWF?
Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components. 
Amazon SWF enables applications for a range of use cases, including media processing, web application back-ends, 
business process workflows, and analytics pipelines, to be designed as a coordination of tasks.


2)What can I do with Amazon SWF?
Amazon SWF can be used to address many challenges that arise while building applications with distributed components. 
For example, you can use Amazon SWF and the accompanying AWS Flow Framework for:

-Writing your applications as asynchronous programs using simple programming constructs that abstract details such as initiating tasks to run remotely and tracking the program’s runtime state.

-Maintaining your application’s execution state (e.g. which steps have completed, which ones are running, etc.). 
You do not have to use databases, custom systems, or ad hoc solutions to keep execution state.
Communicating and managing the flow of work between your application components. 

With Amazon SWF, you do not need to design a messaging protocol or worry about lost and duplicated tasks.

Centralizing the coordination of steps in your application. Your coordination logic does not have to be scattered across

Amazon AppFlow FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is Amazon AppFlow?
Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service 
(SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, 
in just a few clicks. With AppFlow, you can run data flows at nearly any scale at the frequency you choose - on a schedule, 
in response to a business event, or on demand. You can configure powerful data transformation capabilities like filtering and 
validation to generate rich, ready-to-use data as part of the flow itself, without additional steps. AppFlow automatically encrypts 
data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public Internet for SaaS applications that are 
integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats.




================================================= 
AWS Step Functions FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is AWS Step Functions?
AWS Step Functions is a fully managed service that makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and 
microservices using visual workflows. 

Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete 
function lets you scale easily and change applications quickly. 

Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate 
components and step through the functions of your application. Step Functions provides a graphical console 
to arrange and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. 

This makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and 
retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. 

Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly. 
You can change and add steps without even writing code, so you can easily evolve your application and innovate faster.



2)What are some common AWS Step Functions use cases?
AWS Step Functions helps with any computational problem or business process that can be subdivided into a series of steps. 
It’s also useful for creating end-to-end workflows to manage jobs with interdependencies. 
Common use cases include:

Data processing: consolidate data from multiple databases into unified reports, refine and reduce large data sets into useful formats, 
or coordinate multi-step analytics and machine learning workflows

DevOps and IT automation: build tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment, or create event-driven applications 
that automatically respond to changes in infrastructure

E-commerce: automate mission-critical business processes, such as order fulfillment and inventory tracking

Web applications: implement robust user registration processes and sign-on authentication



================================================= 
Amazon CloudWatch FAQs:
================================================= 


1)What is Amazon CloudWatch?
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. 
You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. 
Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, 
as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate. 
You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and 
operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your application running smoothly.



2)What can I use to access CloudWatch?
Amazon CloudWatch can be accessed via API, command-line interface, AWS SDKs, and the AWS Management Console.


3)How do I retrieve my log data?
You can retrieve any of your log data using the CloudWatch Logs console or through the CloudWatch Logs CLI. 
Log events are retrieved based on the Log Group, Log Stream and time with which they are associated. 
The CloudWatch Logs API for retrieving log events is GetLogEvents.

You can use the CLI to retrieve your log events and search through them using command line grep or similar search functions.


4)What is CloudWatch Dashboards?
Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards allow you to create, customize, interact with, and save graphs of AWS resources and custom metrics.


5)What is CloudWatch Events?
Amazon CloudWatch Events (CWE) is a stream of system events describing changes in your AWS resources. 
The events stream augments the existing CloudWatch Metrics and Logs streams to provide a more complete picture of the 
health and state of your applications. You write declarative rules to associate events of interest with automated actions to be taken.


6) What services emit CloudWatch Events?
Currently, Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and AWS CloudTrail are supported. 
Via AWS CloudTrail, mutating API calls (i.e., all calls except Describe*, List*, and Get*) across all services are 
visible in CloudWatch Events.


================================================= 
AWS Auto Scaling FAQs:
================================================= 
1)What is AWS Auto Scaling? 
AWS Auto Scaling helps you configure consistent and congruent scaling policies across the full infrastructure stack 
backing your application. AWS Auto Scaling will automatically scale resources as needed to align to your selected scaling strategy, 
so you maintain performance and pay only for the resources you actually need.


2)When should I use AWS Auto Scaling?
You should use AWS Auto Scaling if you have an application that uses one or more scalable resources and experiences variable load. 
A good example would be an e-commerce web application that receives variable traffic through the day. 
It follows a standard three tier architecture with Elastic Load Balancing for distributing incoming traffic, 
Amazon EC2 for the compute layer, and DynamoDB for the data layer. 
In this case, AWS Auto Scaling will scale one or more EC2 Auto Scaling groups and DynamoDB tables that are powering the application 
in response to the demand curve.



3) How much does AWS Auto Scaling cost?
Similar to Auto Scaling on individual AWS resources, AWS Auto Scaling is free to use. 
AWS Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch, so service fees apply for CloudWatch and your application resources 
(such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, etc.).




================================================= 
AWS CloudFormation FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is AWS CloudFormation?
CloudFormation introduces four concepts: A template is a JSON or YAML declarative code file that describes the intended 
state of all the resources you need to deploy your application


AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and 
third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

Developers can deploy and update compute, database, and many other resources in a simple, declarative style that 
abstracts away the complexity of specific resource APIs. 


2)How is CloudFormation different from AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
These services are designed to complement each other. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment where you can easily 
deploy and run applications in the cloud. It is integrated with developer tools and provides a one-stop experience for 
managing application lifecycle. If your application workloads can be managed as Elastic Beanstalk workloads, 
you can enjoy a more turn-key experience in creating and updating applications. Behind the scenes, 
Elastic Beanstalk uses CloudFormation to create and maintain resources. If your application requirements dictate more custom control, 
the additional functionality of CloudFormation gives you more options to control your workloads.

AWS CloudFormation is a convenient provisioning mechanism for a broad range of AWS and third-party resources. 
It supports the infrastructure needs of many different types of applications such as existing enterprise applications, 
legacy applications, applications built using a variety of AWS resources, and container-based solutions 
(including those built using AWS Elastic Beanstalk).



3)How much does AWS CloudFormation cost?
There is no additional charge for using AWS CloudFormation with resource providers in the following 
namespaces: AWS::*, Alexa::*, and Custom::*. In this case, you pay for AWS resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances, 
Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, etc.) created using AWS CloudFormation just as if you had created them manually. 
You only pay for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no required upfront commitments.



================================================= 
AWS CloudTrail FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is AWS CloudTrail?
AWS CloudTrail enables auditing, security monitoring, and operational troubleshooting by tracking user activity and API usage. 
CloudTrail logs, continuously monitors, and retains account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure, 
giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.


2)Who should use CloudTrail?
You should use CloudTrail if you need to audit activity, monitor security, or troubleshoot operational issues.


3)How can I secure my CloudTrail log files?
By default, CloudTrail log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 Server Side Encryption (SSE) and placed into your S3 bucket. 
You can control access to log files by applying IAM or S3 bucket policies. You can add an additional layer of security by 
enabling S3 Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete on your S3 bucket. 


4)Why should I use AWS CloudTrail Lake?
CloudTrail Lake allows you to examine incidents by querying all actions logged by CloudTrail. 
It simplifies incident logging by helping to remove operational dependencies and provides tools that can help reduce 
your reliance on complex data process pipelines that span across teams. 


5)How do I get charged for AWS CloudTrail?
AWS CloudTrail allows you to view, search, and download the last 90 days of your account’s management events for free. 
You can deliver one copy of your ongoing management events to Amazon S3 for free by creating a trail. 
Once a CloudTrail trail is set up, Amazon S3 charges apply based on your usage.



================================================= 
AWS Config FAQs:
================================================= 

1)What is AWS Config?
AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, 
and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance. With AWS Config you can discover existing AWS resources, 
export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource was 
configured at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, 
resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.


2)How will I be charged for AWS Config?
With AWS Config, you are charged based on the number of configuration items recorded, the number of active AWS Config rule 
evaluations and the number of conformance pack evaluations in your account. A configuration item is a record of the 
configuration state of a resource in your AWS account. An AWS Config rule evaluation is a compliance state evaluation of a 
resource by a AWS Config rule in your AWS account, and a conformance pack evaluation is the evaluation of a resource by a 
AWS Config rule within the conformance pack.

Amazon Elastic Search to visualize them. You can use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to move the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon ElasticSearch.




5) Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific ?
AWS services that are not region-specific are:
IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront



6) What is CloudWatch?
The Amazon CloudWatch has the following features:
Depending on multiple metrics, it participates in triggering alarms.
Helps in monitoring the AWS environments like CPU utilization, EC2, Amazon RDS instances, Amazon SQS, S3, Load Balancer, SNS, etc.




7) What is an Elastic Transcoder?
To support multiple devices with various resolutions like laptops, tablets, and smartphones, we need to change the resolution and 
format of the video. This can be done easily by an AWS Service tool called the Elastic Transcoder, 
which is a media transcoding in the cloud that exactly lets us do the needful. It is easy to use, cost-effective, 
and highly scalable for businesses and developers.


8) How do you set up SSH agent forwarding so that you do not have to copy the key every time you log in?
Here’s how you accomplish this:
Go to your PuTTY Configuration
Go to the category SSH -> Auth
Enable SSH agent forwarding to your instance



9) How do you configure CloudWatch to recover an EC2 instance?
Here’s how you can configure them:
Create an Alarm using Amazon CloudWatch
In the Alarm, go to Define Alarm -> Actions tab
Choose Recover this instance option



10) What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:
Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI




11) What are Key-Pairs in AWS?
The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our 
identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances. The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a 
Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.



12) How can you recover/login to an EC2 instance for which you have lost the key?
Follow the steps provided below to recover an EC2 instance if you have lost the key:

Verify that the EC2Config service is running
Detach the root volume for the instance
Attach the volume to a temporary instance
Modify the configuration file
Restart the original instance



13) How do you monitor Amazon VPC?
You can monitor VPC by using:
-CloudWatch and CloudWatch logs
-VPC Flow Logs



14) When Would You Prefer Provisioned IOPS over Standard Rds Storage?
You would use Provisioned IOPS when you have batch-oriented workloads. 
]Provisioned IOPS delivers high IO rates, but it is also expensive. 
However, batch processing workloads do not require manual intervention. 



15) How Do Amazon Rds, Dynamodb, and Redshift Differ from Each Other?
Amazon RDS is a database management service for relational databases. It manages patching, upgrading, and data backups automatically. 
It’s a database management service for structured data only. On the other hand, DynamoDB is a NoSQL 
database service for dealing with unstructured data. Redshift is a data warehouse product used in data analysis.



16) What are the factors to consider while migrating to Amazon Web Services?
Here are the factors to consider during AWS migration:
Operational Costs - These include the cost of infrastructure, ability to match demand and supply, transparency, and others.
Workforce Productivity 
Cost avoidance
Operational resilience
Business agility




17) What is RTO and RPO in AWS?
RTO or Recovery Time Objective is the maximum time your business or organization is willing to wait for a recovery to 
complete in the wake of an outage. On the other hand, RPO or Recovery Point Objective is the 
maximum amount of data loss your company is willing to accept as measured in time.





18) What are the advantages of AWS IAM?
AWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access. Various user groups and users may require 
varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed. 
We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.

It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to 
resources without having to create IAM Roles.


19) Explain Connection Draining ?
Connection Draining is an AWS service that allows us to serve current requests on the servers that are either being 
decommissioned or updated.

By enabling this Connection Draining, we let the Load Balancer make an outgoing instance finish its 
existing requests for a set length of time before sending it any new requests. A departing instance will 
immediately go off if Connection Draining is not enabled, and all pending requests will fail.


20) What is Power User Access in AWS?
The AWS Resources owner is identical to an Administrator User. ,
The Administrator User can build, change, delete, and inspect resources, as well as grant permissions to other AWS users.

Administrator Access without the ability to control users and permissions is provided to a Power User. 
A Power User Access user cannot provide permissions to other users but has the ability to modify, remove, view, and create resources.

2)A web application hosted on a fleet of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group. 
You are exposing this application through an Application Load Balancer. Both the EC2 instances and the ALB are deployed on a 
VPC with the following CIDR 192.168.0.0/18. 
How do you configure the EC2 instances' security group to ensure only the ALB can access them on port 80?

Ans:Add an Inbound Rule with port 80  and ALB's Security Group as the source.
This is the most secure way of ensuring only the ALB can access the EC2 instances. 
Referencing by security groups in rules is an extremely powerful rule and many questions at the exam rely on it. 
Make sure you fully master the concepts behind it!

3)An application is deployed with an Application Load Balancer and an Auto Scaling Group. Currently, you manually 
scale the ASG and you would like to define a Scaling Policy that will ensure the average number of connections to your

Your colleague can run the application on his machine without issues, while you get API Authorization Exceptions. 
What should you do?
Ans:Chack both IAM using AWS Policy Simulator.

2)Filtering of server side data of S3 get List thing its S3 Select & Glacier Select

3) Your application on EC2 creates images thumbnails after profile photos
are uploaded to Amazon S3. These thumbnails can be easily recreated,
and only need to be kept for 45 days. The source images should be able
to be immediately retrieved for these 45 days, and afterwards, the user
can wait up to 6 hours. How would you design this?
S3 source images can be on STANDARD, with a lifecycle configuration
to transition them to GLACIER after 45 days.
S3 thumbnails can be on ONEZONE_IA, with a lifecycle configuration
to expire them (delete them) after 45 days. 

4)
• A rule in your company states that you should be able to recover your
deleted S3 objects immediately for 15 days, although this may happen rarely.
After this time, and for up to 365 days, deleted objects should be recoverable
within 48 hours.
• You need to enable S3 versioning in order to have object versions, so that
“deleted objects” are in fact hidden by a “delete marker” and can be
recovered
• You can transition these “noncurrent versions” of the object to S3_IA
• You can transition afterwards these “noncurrent versions” to
DEEP_ARCHIVE

5)S3Request pay
