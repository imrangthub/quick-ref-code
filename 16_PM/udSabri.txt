- CODE OF ETHICS -



Golden Rules of the Code of Ethics:

· Rule 1: Always obey the laws of the country where your project is located. This is mandatory regardless of where your organization is based.

· Rule 2: Adhere to the policies of your organization. These policies are as important as the local laws and guide ethical behavior within the company.

· Rule 3: Consider customs in your actions and decisions. Customs refer to accepted practices and traditions in a specific culture or community.

· Rule 4: Always be and appear honest and ethical. Your actions should not only be ethical but also perceived as such by others.

Application of Rules in Scenarios:

· Permit Requirements: Obtain permits as required by local laws, even if it causes project delays.

· Sponsor's Instructions: Always follow legal and ethical guidelines, even if instructed otherwise by a sponsor or superior.

· Honesty in Communication: Always be truthful, especially in project-related communications, regardless of pressure to withhold information.

· Accepting Gifts: Only accept gifts if they do not violate local laws, organizational policies, or ethical standards. Avoid accepting gifts in sensitive situations like procurement processes to prevent the perception of bribery.

Additional Ethical Considerations:

· Reporting Violations: Report any violations of laws and policies, but only with clear evidence.

· Respect for Intellectual Property: Do not use others' work without permission. Seek permission to use documents created in previous employment.

General Mindset for Ethics: Assume the mindset of being the most honest person in the world and always doing the right thing.
