Question 1
Skipped
Your firm has experienced a challenging quarter due to marketplace conditions. The organizational income has affected all of the projects that were expected to be completed. After meeting with several stakeholders, you have found a significant bottleneck in procurement, causing schedule impacts. There is only one person in the procurement office who is authorized to approve any company charges. Knowing how tight funds are in the company, this person scrutinizes every purchase and contract before approving the purchase. What should you do next in this scenario?
Correct answer
Consult with the head of the procurement office.
Review project constraints and assumptions.
Alert the project sponsor to the delay that is likely to occur.
Review the resource management plan.
Overall explanation
The first thing you should do is consult with the head of the procurement office. Addressing the problem head-on is always best, and you may learn more information that may provide you with another solution. The person reviewing the purchasing may need more lead time for purchase requests, and this information can assist you in planning accordingly. This person is a project stakeholder, so it is appropriate to engage the individual to see how you can better manage the project in anticipation of the longer purchasing cycle. While reviewing the resource management plan is a good idea, it will not solve any organization-wide issues. Project sponsors will need to be alerted. However, you should bring a solution to the sponsors, which should be determined after meeting with the head of the procurement office. While reviewing project constraints and assumptions is a good idea, that process will not solve any organization-wide issues.

Alina is a senior project manager for the Allin Corporation and has led large, technical projects over the past twelve years. Marcus has recently earned his CAPM and has joined the Allin Corporation as a junior project manager. Management has tasked Alina to mentor Marcus on the best project management practices Alina uses. What is an example of feedback that Marcus may hear from Alina as a mentor?
I have shared some written documentation for you to consult on this process, Marcus.
Marcus, you should ask our intern, Juliana, to send that email.
Marcus, you need to deliver the payables reports by 11:00 on Thursday.
Correct answer
Let's spend an hour working on this report together, Marcus.
Overall explanation
Alina sitting down and performing a process while showing Marcus what she has learned is a prime example of mentorship. Mentorship, also called coaching, is based on recommendations and helping people reach their goals. Delivering the payable reports is an example of delegation, not coaching Marcus. Alina's sharing of documentation is more of an example of supporting Marcus rather than mentoring Marcus; this is because Alina is not actively helping Marcus in this example, as she would as a mentor. Asking the intern to send an email is an example of delegation, not a best practice on organizational processes.

Quincy is the scrum master for Project Ironworks, which just completed its third iteration. The project team wants to transition several deliverables to the operations team, but the operations team does not believe the deliverables are complete. Quincy consults the product owner for help. How can Quincy and the product owner determine if the deliverables are ready to be transitioned?
Correct answer
Refer to the agreed-upon definition of done.
Trust the project team that the deliverables are ready for deployment.
Perform a spike to determine if the deliverables are ready.
Escalate the request to the product owner.
Overall explanation
The definition of done is an agreed-upon way to determine if a deliverable is complete, which will help Quincy and the product owner determine if the deliverables are done or not. Quincy should trust the project team’s word, but he should back it up by confirming if the deliverables meet the definition of done. A spike is used to examine, learn, or configure new technology. Escalating the situation to the product owner is not the best answer for this question as the product owner has been consulted already.

Otto is preparing for his team's first in-person meeting. He has created an agenda for the meeting. Otto included presentation details with what the project will be about and a 3D model of what they will be working on from another project. Otto has requested that his team members review this material before the meeting and raise any questions or concerns. What type of knowledge does this scenario best describe?
Project knowledge
Organizational knowledge
Tacit knowledge
Correct answer
Explicit knowledge
Overall explanation
Otto has prepared documents for his teammates to review that can be absorbed by reading through the material and viewing the presentation. Explicit knowledge can easily be codified using words, numbers, and pictures. Organizational knowledge is about managing programs or portfolios. Tacit knowledge is knowledge with context that is difficult to codify as it resides in the minds of people. Project knowledge is knowledge about implementing the tools and techniques to achieve the goals of the project.

Constance is an experienced project manager in your organization, and she is leading a large, complex project with 52 key stakeholders. Constance uses the SCARF Model by David Rock to help consider biological responses as she interacts with stakeholders. The project team has worked together on similar projects, and they feel confident they can be successful on this project. Constance has empowered the team to first create and agree upon project ground rules. The team adapts grounds rules from a previous project they worked on together. In the rules, which Constance approves, the team is to be self-managing, make decisions, experiment for the best possible outcomes, and mentor one another as needed. Based on the SCARF model, in which aspects are Constance and the project team most minimizing project threats?
Status and Autonomy
Status and Fairness
Relatedness and Certainty
Correct answer
Relatedness and Fairness
Overall explanation
The theory of this model is that the human brain is prewired to minimize threats and maximize rewards. The word SCARF is an acronym, which stands for: Status – the relative importance to others, Certainty – the ability to predict the future, Autonomy – the sense of control over events, Relatedness – the sense of safety with others, Fairness – the perception of fair exchanges. A self-managing team minimizes the threats of loss of fairness by having rules come from within rather than without, and mentoring can build relatedness. Status and fairness do not address or minimize threats as status is about the relative importance to others, not addressing threats to the project. Relatedness and certainty do not minimize threats as relatedness is about teamwork and community within the project, which is admirable, but does not address risks. The project team has status and autonomy, but these attributes do not address the project risks.

Question 6
Skipped
Keith is a successful facilitator in his agile meetings. He sets aside two minutes at the start of major meetings to cover two things. Those are most likely to be
Correct answer
The objective of the meeting and a few basic ground rules.
A word about ensuring everyone is on time for meetings and completes their pre-work.
A quick overview of each topic and how many minutes are allocated to each.
A pep talk on the progress of the project.
Overall explanation
Keith should focus on objective and ground rules versus the other items, as it is critical to communicate the project vision regularly. Agile methods do specifically require that the team is aligned with the vision, while they do not require the other choices. There is no need to set aside special time to go into detail about each topic the team will discuss, as this would go against the agile principle of simplicity. There is no specific need to hold pep talks for the team regularly. There is no need to set aside special time on time and pre-work chat, as this would go against the agile principle of simplicity.

You are a senior project manager for your organization and many project managers look to you for advice and coaching. Your supervisor has asked you to help train a new project manager, Joyce. You are reviewing several lessons learned documents with Joyce that should help onboard her and familiarize her with the way your organization manages projects. Which of the following lessons learned represents tacit knowledge?
Correct answer
Jonathan, a senior project manager, often has a difficult time eliciting stakeholder feedback from the marketing department at your company.
The technical codebase will be outdated by 2027 and will need to be refactored by then to adhere to new database policies.
A key supplier, T9 Woodworking, has upped its pricing by 15% for future projects.
Going forward, company policy states that projects over $5M will require signature authority from the CEO.
Overall explanation
Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to communicate. This kind of knowledge is typically related to experience, ability, or emotion. Therefore, Jonathan's negative experience and strained ability with the marketing department is a clear example of tacit knowledge. The other choices represent examples of explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is fact-based knowledge that is easily communicated through words or symbols. A key supplier, T9 Woodworking, has upped its pricing by 15% for future projects is an example of explicit knowledge as it is fact-based and easily communicated and understood. The technical codebase that will be outdated by 2027 is an example of explicit knowledge. A new company policy is an example of explicit knowledge.

Margaret is the project manager for the Momentum Project, which will affect multiple lines of business when it is finished. So that the work does not affect current business cycles, Margaret has decided to schedule each project milestone to end. This is an example of which of the following choices?
Expert judgment
WBS scheduling
Correct answer
Soft logic
Constraint
Overall explanation
The correct response is soft logic, which allows the project manager to make decisions based on conditions outside the project, guidelines, or best practices. WBS scheduling is incorrect because it does not fully describe the scenario. Expert judgment does not fully describe the situation and is therefore incorrect. This scenario is not an example of constraints because the project manager is not required to use soft logic.

Spike is the scrum master for Project AZ, eight iterations into its development with a velocity of 28 story points. Recently, a new developer, Tanya, joined the team and began work. In addition to introducing Tanya to everyone on the team, what else should Spike do?
Introduce Tanya to the product owner.
Show Tanya the project’s knowledge base.
Pair Tanya up with another team member as a mentor.
Correct answer
Ensure Tanya understands everyone on the team’s responsibilities.
Overall explanation
While all of the answers are reasonable, the best answer is that Spike should ensure Tanya knows the roles and responsibilities on the team, which will help Tanya understand what everyone does and who to go to for help. Giving Tanya a mentor is a good idea but will not help her understand the team members’ roles and responsibilities. Knowing who the product owner is essential but will not help Tanya integrate with the team. The knowledge base is critical but is not the next best step.

Jacob is the project manager of a construction project that is nearly ten percent over budget due to errors and rework. The project sponsor is not happy with the project performance and the PMO asks Jacob to provide a report on the cost of conformance. Which of the following should he include?
Correct answer
Quality training
Rework of deliverables
Scrap
Inventory costs
Overall explanation
Quality training is the only cost listed that would be included in the cost of conformance. Quality training can be interpreted as a preventative measure to avoid expenses in the future. This is a tricky question as the background story hints at the cost of nonconformance, which is scrap and waste, rework of deliverables, but the question is asking for the cost of conformance. Scrap is the cost of nonconformance to quality, sometimes called poor quality. Inventory costs describe the cost to keep inventory "on the shelf" until it is needed. If materials are wasted, then inventory is pulled to the project work and the inventory on hand is replenished. Rework of deliverables is the cost of nonconformance to quality, sometimes called poor quality.

Timothy is the project manager for Project WXA, and he is working with his team and the key stakeholders to plan the project work. After a recent stakeholder meeting, Timothy sent a short survey to each stakeholder. Included in this survey are questions related to their knowledge of the work, requirements, and risks within Project WXA. What is the most likely reason Timothy is doing this?
Correct answer
Timothy would like to appraise their background knowledge.
Timothy is confirming who his stakeholders are.
His project management office required it.
Timothy wants to be aware of each stakeholder personally.
Overall explanation
Understanding a stakeholder's level of knowledge for project domains, usually centering on scope, is critical to successful project management. The project management office requiring the survey is not the best answer. Getting to know stakeholders personally is a good tactic, but a survey is not a good way to do this. Sending this survey will also not confirm who the stakeholders are.

You have just acquired an ongoing project from Joanne, who has accepted a job offer in another state and is leaving the company. You are now responsible for her projects, and you are reviewing the progress and project management plans to familiarize yourself with the ongoing work. Upon reviewing the procurement documents, you become concerned by the number of contracts signed as they all turn out to be cost-plus-fixed-fee types of contracts. Why would this be a situation of concern?
Correct answer
Vendors have no incentive to control costs.
Contracts should always be time and material.
Contracts should always be fixed-price.
All the risk is now with the seller.
Overall explanation
Vendors have no motivation to control costs under these terms. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts require the organization to pay vendors for the costs incurred, in addition to an agreed percentage of the cost. Therefore, there is no motivation for the seller to control the costs. Cost-plus-fixed-fee type contracts transfer the risks to the buyer making this answer incorrect. Not all contracts should be time and material, making this answer choice incorrect. Not all contracts should be fixed price, and a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may have value in some circumstances.

Correct answer
Information is held and is not freely shared.
Understand and acceptance of personal responsibility.
A willingness to consider and change alternative views.
Personal commitment to the project.
Overall explanation
Information is freely and widely shared on high-performing teams, not hidden or tightly held. High-performing teams do take personal responsibility for successes and failures. High-performing teams do see the project and solutions from multiple perspectives. Personal commitment to the project is an attribute of high-performing teams.

Kiera is a project manager for her organization, and she is utilizing a predictive approach for an interior design project for a conference center. This project has been in the newspapers as it will promote large events in the city's downtown and bring visitors from around the world. Hotels, restaurants, and other downtown businesses are excited about the change the improvement will bring to the city. Kiera also has stakeholders from the management company of the events to be held in the center, government officials, media, the public at large, and a host of vendors. As her team works, new stakeholders are discovered depending on their work in the project. One of the most frequent complaints that she gets is from stakeholders is that they are not informed of different project aspects. What document should Kiera create with her team to better inform stakeholders of work that may affect them as the project moves forward?
Correct answer
Communications management plan
RACI matrix
Stakeholder engagement plan
Information radiator on a public website
Overall explanation
Kiera needs a detailed communications management plan that should address who needs what information, when it is needed, and the expected modality. If stakeholders are not aware of activities that may affect them in this project, then communication is failing – likely because the plan does not include a schedule and triggers to alert the affected stakeholders before the work begins. A RACI matrix uses the legend of Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It is a matrix that maps out the assignments and accountability. The stakeholder engagement plan is not the best choice as the problem in this scenario is communication, not engagement. Stakeholders are generally excited about the project, but not about the poor communication in the project. An information radiator is a public posting of project progress and is generally used in agile projects.

Stephanie works at a major construction company in Texas, and she is seeking to adopt lean principles into their day-to-day practices. She has been tasked with developing processes that focus on Target Value Design (TVD) principles. Stephanie is not familiar with the regulations of the TVD and asks the local PMI chapter about the steps she should take to implement TVD. Which of the following choices is
Align the project organization based on lean principles and commercial terms.
Correct answer
Use cost estimating techniques where possible
The project definition process
Cost and target management
Overall explanation
The use of cost estimating techniques such as analogous and bottom-up estimating is not a principle of TVD. These techniques are only one part of cost management. The remaining three answers are the three principles of TVD. The project definition process states that TVD roots target cost into allowable cost and client's business goals and engages designers and builders in validating the business plan. Cost and target management aim at designing cost and value with a decentralized management system. TVD is also a systemic approach to project management that aligns the project organization and is an operating system based on lean principles and commercial terms.

Adam is assigned as the on-site construction manager for your rural hydro project. The project has matured to the installation phase, and the subcontractors have completed most of the work. During a test run, Adam finds intermittency in voltage and determines the root cause is faulty transmission wires. Looking through your procurement documents, it becomes clear that your organization purchased the material and supplied it to your subcontractor for installation. What would be the appropriate approach to avoid this issue in the future?
Correct answer
Consult with your procurement director to update product acceptance criteria and include test records for all future orders.
Contact your sub-contractor, report the issue, and ask them to replace the faulty section.
Contact the supplier and ask for test records for the material provided.
Contact your supplier, report the issue, and ask for a refund.
Overall explanation
The question here is how to avoid the issue in the future. By imposing a revised procurement governance model for material acceptance and quality checkpoints performed by the supplier, installing faulty material may be reduced. The question asks how to prevent the problem in the future proactively, and the other options are reactive responses to the problem, which makes them incorrect answers to the question.

Thomas is a junior developer on a project which is currently ten weeks into a fifteen-week deployment and roughly on schedule but is at risk of being $10,000 over budget. During a recent planning meeting, the project manager, Tanya, and the team reviewed all known risks and brainstormed new ones. This confuses Thomas since the team already did this during planning. What is the most likely response Tanya will give if Thomas asks why she is reviewing risks now?
The project had some float that Tanya wanted to use.
The steering committee is nervous the project will miss its budget.
Correct answer
Risks should continually be reviewed and updated.
Tanya allocated some contingency reserves to reviewing risk.
Overall explanation
Risks should be continually reviewed and prioritized during a project's lifecycle, even if things are going well. This helps minimize the chance of an unknown risk impacting the project. While the steering committee may be nervous, this is not the best response to Thomas's question. Float is the number of days a task can be delayed without impacting the project's duration. Contingency reserves are used to respond to known risks.

As the project manager of an agile project at Beverly Logistics, Raj wants the team to be co-located. Of the following, which describes when an agile team is considered co-located?
All team members on the same campus is being co-located
Co-located means all team members are in the same building, on the same floor
Being co-located is when all team members are in the same city
Correct answer
Co-located means all team members are located within 33 feet of each other and have no barriers.
Overall explanation
Colocation is when all agile team members are within 33 feet of each other and have no barriers. The other responses are incorrect because the team members are not close enough to be considered co-located by agile standards. Team members are considered virtually co-located if they use technology to communicate, even if they are on the same floor, city, or campus. The best way of describing colocation here is when team members are within 33 feet of one another.

Charles is a veteran project manager who has just been assigned a new project and a new team to complete the project. The project will last two years, has a budget of $10,000,000 and this team will be together for the foreseeable future. On the first day, Charles is interrupted by two team members who wish to create ground rules for the team. Jan and Karen try to persuade Charles that they should be the ones writing the ground rules for the project team as they have worked with most of the people before and Charles has not. Jan and Karen are happy to write the rules and present them to Charles by the end of the business day. What should Charles do next?
Decline their offer as Charles will write the ground rules.
Correct answer
Decline their offer as Charles wants all project team members to participate.
Accept their offer, but the project team must approve the rules, not Charles.
Accept their offer and review the rules for approval.
Overall explanation
Ground rules should not be written by only a portion of the project team members, but all project team members. Charles should not accept their offer. It is likely Jan and Karen have some ulterior motives for writing the ground rules. Charles does not write the ground rules as it is the role of the project team collectively. Charles should not have Jan and Karen write the rules even if the team would approve them. He needs the team to create them together to promote buy-in and acceptance of the rules.

JB is responsible for writing contracts and providing payroll for various employers who want to hire his temps. He works off a template, adjusting certain sections as needed. When he has a working contract, he sends it to a lawyer retained by his company. The lawyer reviews it with an eye to tax and regulatory compliance. If it looks okay, the lawyer files the contract away. How is project compliance being managed?
Compliance documentation
Compliance risk
Correct answer
Compliance audit
Compliance council
Overall explanation
A compliance audit is run to determine if a project is compliant by its own or external standards. Compliance documentation is the written overview of the various compliance requirements a project must meet. A compliance council is a group of compliance specialists that discusses compliance issues for a given project. Compliance risk is the risk associated with not being compliant, for instance, with security needs.

Margaret is in the process of allocating resources to her project and is limited to non-dedicated specialists from other departments. After studying the tasks carefully, Margaret soon realized that her shared resources' specific project activities parallel those departments' operational duties closely measured by the operational management groups. What information can Margaret refer to in setting realistic performance requirements for her non-dedicated team to ensure tasks are completed as agreed?
Service level agreements set by similar organizations.
Service level agreements established based on project requirements.
Correct answer
Service level agreements set by operational managers.
Since the team is not dedicated, tasks will not be completed on time.
Overall explanation
Margaret can rely on operational standards set by the managers. Since there is a parallel with the project's operational duties and activities, integration can occur with the organization's governance. This is usually done by taking knowledge of service level agreement standards and developing the schedule according to the service level agreements available to the project manager. The other options will not provide the information Margaret requires in setting realistic performance requirements.

Max is a developer on a team that is developing software for lawyers. There is no set scope for this software, but the team does have a budget and deadline. The team meets daily for about fifteen minutes to discuss what they have accomplished, what they hope to accomplish, and anything that may be standing in their way. A person who facilitates the daily meetings removes any blockers a teammate may have and encourages the team to keep making progress. What kind of project methodology approach does Max's team have?
Correct answer
Scrum
Plan-driven
Kanban
Predictive
Overall explanation
This is an example of a scrum project methodology. In scrum, the team meets daily for a scrum meeting to discuss what work everyone is doing and work through any blockers. There is a scrum master who is responsible for facilitating this meeting and motivating the team. This would not be a plan-driven approach because there is no set scope for the project in this scenario. Kanban is not evident in this example because there is no evidence of how project work is accomplished. This would not be a predictive approach because there is no set scope for the project in this scenario.

At the first planning poker session, Mark walked the team through how planning poker worked, then asked different team members to explain it in their own words. What is the best explanation for Mark requesting the team to explain it in their own words?
Correct answer
Mark wants to confirm the team understood him.
Mark is unsure how planning poker works and is hoping someone will correct him.
Repeating back instructions is part of planning poker.
Mark is nervous the team will not acknowledge his authority.
Overall explanation
By asking the team to explain back what was communicated, Mark is ensuring they understood the message. This also allows for questions or feedback to be solicited. Repeating back instructions is not part of planning poker. It is unlikely Mark is unaware of how planning poker works. Mark being nervous is not the best explanation for his questions.

Tommy is a project manager on Project SRVUP in a strong matrix environment. This project is an application development project for insurance programs within the organization and has many compliance requirements. Recently, one of the project stakeholders approached him about a challenge with a team member, Roger. The stakeholder said that Roger was overwhelmed and could not accomplish a specific feature. The stakeholder wants Tommy to escalate the issue with Roger's manager. What should Tommy do next?
Review Roger's recent work to identify poor performance.
Correct answer
Thank the stakeholder for their concern and speak with Roger.
Reduce Roger's workload.
Talk to Roger's manager.
Overall explanation
Before taking any action, Tommy needs to understand the issue from Roger's perspective. The stakeholder may be misunderstanding the situation or may be lacking other important information. Given the strong-matrix environment, Roger's manager may not be fully aware of the scenario happening in the project. The best choice is to speak with Roger first. Reducing Roger's workload may not solve the problem as it may only be related to a specific task or may not be as bad as the stakeholder suggests. Reviewing Roger's recent work would not uncover a misunderstanding the stakeholder has.

Always, the critical path is the one path that cannot be delayed, or the whole project will be delayed.
The critical path is a network that hosts the activities most important for the success of the project.
Correct answer
The path with the longest duration is the critical path.
The path that does not deviate from the project plan from start to finish is the critical path.
Overall explanation
The correct response is the path with the longest duration is always the critical path. Additionally, the critical path is the minimum amount of time for the project to be completed. This is a distraction answer and is incorrect because there can be more than one critical path in a network diagram. This response does not describe the critical path adequately and is incorrect. This response is incorrect because the critical path does not host a network; it hosts the activities.

Sami is managing a small agile project team of ten people that have been together for several years. They are all friends and rarely have serious disagreements. Some team members have sometimes dated each other, but Sami has noticed that these relationships have ended amicably. Two team members are happily married, and the others have moved on to others without evident bitterness. Sami’s company sends him compliance materials covering areas such as sexual harassment, dating between colleagues, and other similar policies recently instituted by the company. These policies were revised due to a lawsuit which the company lost in this area. What should Sami do with the compliance materials?
Correct answer
Embrace the materials and stress their importance to the team.
Tell his team to do it but only to make corporate happy.
Ignore the directive.
Talk about his own rules for dating within the team.
Overall explanation
Sami should embrace these materials as protection for both himself and his project team. While compliance videos and testing can be wooden at times, presenting this to his team can help head off serious problems resulting in a lawsuit down the road. Sami cannot assume based on past observations of his team. Issues between co-workers sometimes get swept under the rug, and even if a situation looks calm, there could be serious issues under the surface. Sami should not just tell his team to do it to make corporate happy, but he needs to communicate the reason why and be in alignment with the organizational policies. Sami cannot ignore the directive as he represents the organization and has been asked to share the information. Sami needs to be in alignment with what the organization calls for because the organization’s rules supersede Sami’s rules.

Zack is the project manager of new patient care software for the hospital where he works. This project has a rolling distribution of software and training for the staff that must be accomplished within the next six months. During a weekly project planning meeting, Zack thoroughly explains the requirements he wants his project team to accomplish for the next month. However, many team members have side conversations with each other or are looking at their mobile devices. After two weeks have passed, Zack sees very little progress on the requirements he outlined during the meeting. What interpersonal or team skill best describes what was not adequately adhered to during the meeting?
Cultural awareness
Political awareness
Networking
Correct answer
Active listening
Overall explanation
Active listening techniques involve acknowledging, clarifying, confirming, understanding, and removing barriers that adversely affect comprehension. The team was distracted and not involved in the planning meeting, so active listening did not happen. Zack needed to bring the team's focus back to the meeting agenda and confirm their understanding of the assignments. Cultural awareness is crucial when leading a project, but that does not describe the scenario in this question. Networking is interacting with others to exchange information and develop contacts. Political awareness describes the political landscape within the organization and surrounding the project, something this question does not really address.

Kenneth has an interdepartmental project that deals with complex issues. The project is in the execution phase. Kenneth sends out weekly status reports to all stakeholders, communicating the project's state regarding its schedule, budget, quality, and risks. Kenneth is using which of the following?
Poor scope management
Good communication management
Correct answer
Poor stakeholder engagement
Good stakeholder engagement
Overall explanation
Kenneth's communication is project-level. While his report may be useful, it does not do much to engage stakeholders. Kenneth also needs to communicate why things are being done, enabling effective cooperation through a shared vision. Good stakeholder engagement includes stakeholder-level communication that discusses why things are being done, enabling effective cooperation through a shared vision. Good stakeholder engagement focuses on 'why' rather than 'what,' removes jargon barriers and seemingly irrelevant details. Good stakeholder engagement leads to effective information exchange. Communication management ensures that the right people receive the correct information as expected and in the correct modality. Scope management focuses on completing and controlling the project scope. This question does not address the need for scope management in this scenario.

Nicola, a new project manager, inherits a problem when she joins a team. Namely, the product they are designing is becoming too complicated due to the number of new features requested by the stakeholders on behalf of the user community. Nicola assesses the product and concludes that it is not one but two products. She outlines the different use cases for each project by thinking about them in terms of the users' goals rather than her company's expectations and imagining how the products could be marketed separately. Which personality indicator is the project manager displaying?
Managerial
Systemic
Correct answer
Creative
Courteous
Overall explanation
Creative behavior is marked by the ability to think abstractly or see things differently. The project manager demonstrates a creative personality indicator by recognizing that a product's complexity can be reduced by creating two products. Courteous behavior allows people to empathize with others' positions while also giving consideration to their concerns. Systemic behavior is holistic behavior and is described as working together and for the common good. You might see systemic behavior as the golden rule – treating others as you want to be treated. Managerial behavior is the ability to organize and lead groups of people effectively.

As an agile project leader, Mark’s role is not to be a project “dictator.” How are decisions made in agile projects?
Usually, it is the development team’s responsibility to make decisions.
The member of management who has the most seniority makes the decisions.
Correct answer
Collectively, stakeholders agree on and share decisions.
Business partners are responsible for decision-making.
Overall explanation
For stakeholders, the need for effective decision-making is increased because agile methods nurture team empowerment. This need can be accomplished by using two different methods a collective agreement, which means the entire team is in agreement with the decision, and a shared decision, meaning the team and the stakeholders together come to a decision, as opposed to one party making the project decision. The other responses are incorrect. Project decisions are not just made by the most senior management member, the business partners, or the development team, but by the entire project team.

As the agile team leader for Bowling Green Logistics, Sheena encourages knowledge sharing at which point of a project?
When the iteration ends
Correct answer
Throughout the whole project
When the project ends
When a team member shows interest in a task
Overall explanation
Knowledge sharing during the whole project will ensure that information is not in just one person's possession. The other responses are incorrect. Waiting to share information when the iteration or project ends, or only when it is asked for, is a recipe for failure. When information is not shared throughout the project, it may be time-consuming and expensive to unravel mistakes.

Overall explanation
The image provided is an example of a Kanban board. A Kanban board is a visual representation of the statuses of work items that a team is working on and has in the backlog. This is not a user story. User stories define the role, function, and value of the requirement from a users' perspective. This is not a story point. Story points are values assigned to user stories to judge their size and effort. This is not scrum, as scrum is a project management methodology, not a tangible, visible item.

You are the project manager for your organization, which is a large financial firm located in London. The firm has always worked with in-office employees and has never entertained remote workers. In consideration of new technology and the pandemic, management is not coming to you for input on creating a virtual team environment for you to manage. Many of the executives have a negative connotation of virtual teams. Which of the following is not an example of a virtual team?
A team of software developers located in the United States and Poland.
A remote team of marketing agents in New York City.
Correct answer
A team of telemarketers who work in an office in Delhi.
A team of publishers located in Houston and Dallas.
Overall explanation
The telemarketers in Delhi do not represent a virtual team. These team members work in the same office space. All other choices represent teams that do not share the same workspace. A virtual team represents a team that is not co-located. A virtual team can be comprised of team members in the same city. However, if the team members are not in the same space, they are a virtual team. A team of software developers located in the United States and Poland is a virtual team. A team of publishers located in Houston and Dallas is a virtual team. A remote team of marketing agents in New York City is a virtual team.

Seth is the project manager for a project six months into a twelve-month deployment schedule, one week ahead of schedule, and $1,000 under budget. While reviewing the project schedule for the next two weeks, Seth notes a slight chance that a task with six days of float may be delayed one day. What is the most appropriate risk response to this scenario?
Avoid
Amplify
Transfer
Correct answer
Accept
Overall explanation
Given the low risk of this event occurring, the six days of float, and the fact that the project is ahead of schedule Seth should accept this risk. Transferring may be possible but would increase the cost to the project for little gain. Amplifying is used for positive risks. Seth could avoid this risk; however, it is not the best solution given the low impact.

Tony is the project manager for a project which is nine weeks into a twenty-week implementation cycle. Recently Tony has heard reports that stakeholders are having trouble navigating the project's knowledge base. The stakeholders are interrupting the project team, asking them questions that are included in the project's knowledge base. What should Tony do next?
Correct answer
Speak with stakeholders to understand what challenges they are having and adjust accordingly.
Do nothing. The stakeholders will eventually figure it out.
Remove anything over three months old to make the knowledge base smaller.
Train stakeholders on how to use the knowledge base.
Overall explanation
The project's knowledge management system and knowledge base should be easy to navigate for the stakeholders to pull the information they may need. Tony should speak with the stakeholders who are having challenges to see what is causing problems. Once he understands the root cause of the problem, he should modify the knowledge base to make it easier to navigate. Training the stakeholders will not resolve the underlying cause of the problem. Training is not necessarily needed, but an easy-to-navigate knowledge base is. Removing old material risks losing important information. Doing nothing will not help the stakeholders find the information they need.

The contractor is licensed and ensures the work meets government compliance. The project team, government officials, and other stakeholders have signed off on the contractor’s work. What should Rob do next?
Release any remaining budget for Project Steephill.
Continue work on Project Steephill as planned.
Correct answer
Review all project contracts to ensure they are complete.
Report to the steering committee that the project is done.
Overall explanation
Rob should review all the project contracts to ensure they were adequately closed out and confirm that the project team accepted the project deliverables. Rob should not continue work until he is satisfied all contracts were properly closed out.Only a portion of a project’s budget is committed to contracts, so Rob should not release the remaining money. Reporting to the steering committee is not ideal as Rob has not confirmed that the contracts are finalized. Before the project can be closed, all contracts should be closed as well.

Next week a new team member that is a contractor will join the project team, and Jessie wants to prepare for the new member. What are the possible steps for Jessie to help a newcomer integrate with the team and get up to speed with the ground rules?
Correct answer
Introduce the new team member to the project team and together review the team's ground rules.
Ensure the contractor is correctly listed in the Project Management Information System (PMIS).
Individually introduce the new team member to each stakeholder.
Report the new team member's start date to the Project Management Office (PMO).
Overall explanation
Once the new team member joins the project team, Jessie should introduce him to the project team and help the newcomer get familiar with the team's ground rules. With such behavior, Jessie will help a newcomer get acquainted with the basic rules followed by the team and expedite the newcomer's onboarding. Introducing the new team member individually to stakeholders is not a good use of time. Reporting the new team member's start date to the PMO is not going to help the team member integrate with the team. While the new team member will likely need access to the PMIS, this choice will not integrate a newcomer with the team or get them up to speed on the ground rules.

While reviewing the project plan, Arnold notices many tasks require skill sets not available at his company. Arnold consults with the project team, and they confirm they do not have the needed skill sets. The team is willing to learn, but the training may take significant time, and the team is uncertain how often the skill sets will be utilized in future projects or operations. What execution approach is Arnold likely to suggest?
Hire specialists to fill the gaps.
Send the team to training.
Cancel the project.
Correct answer
Rely on contractors to fill many of the skills gaps.
Overall explanation
Bringing in temporary contractors to fill the skills gaps will allow Arnold to move the project along without burdening his company with too much overhead or delays in the project completion. Hiring specialists is not ideal as their skills may not be needed after Project S is completed. Training the team on these new technologies will be time and resource-intensive. Because the project is on a fixed deadline, the training could cause delays in the project's completion. Canceling the project is not a good idea as consultants can be brought in to assist.

Cody is a project manager at an agricultural organization. The organization's structure requires its team members to report to another individual who directs them on what field to harvest, how much they should harvest, and where the harvested items should be stored. Cody is rarely consulted on these matters as they are day-to-day operations, and he is primarily focused on the research and development department. What kind of organizational structure best describes the scenario above?
Projectized
Hybrid
Matrix
Correct answer
Functional
Overall explanation
The scenario above best describes a functional organization. Each department is responsible for carrying out a specific, similar activity set in this type of organizational structure. Multiple people perform each type of activity (in this case, harvesting). Reporting is hierarchical, with each reporting to a single manager. Additionally, the project manager's authority is low relative to the functional manager's authority. A matrix structure means the project team comes from many departments or lines of business in the organization. The team may be on more than one project, and the project manager and the functional managers share authority over the project decisions and budget. A projectized structure, also called a project-centric structure, means the project team is on just one project, reports to the project manager, and the project manager has full authority over the project. A hybrid project is a custom-designed structure that can vary in each organization. For example, the organization could normally operate as a functional structure, but they will use a functional structure for a special project.

Correct answer
Theory Y
Maslow's Hierarchy
Theory X
Parkinson's Law
Overall explanation
The best choice refers to Herzberg's Theory of X and Y. Y people are capable and self-led, while X people are lazy, need to be micromanaged, and need lots of direction. Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. Maslow's Hierarchy refers to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, where there are five levels of needs that one strives to meet in the workplace physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization.

RTC Corporation has hired Ben as a project manager in an agile-predictive hybrid environment. Ben has discovered that multiple processes are delaying product deployments up to six weeks. As a servant leader, he must make decisions that will prevent bottleneck processes. What options could Ben develop that would allow the resolution of these impediments?
Completely do away with the current processes and develop new policies to resolve process time and project completion more effectively.
Tell stakeholders that there have been no options found, and to deploy a quality product, they must settle for the delay.
Correct answer
Work with process auditors to find ways to refine, simplify or remove unneeded processes that hinder product deployment.
Have team members add more product development to their tasks allowing for more options to present to stakeholders.
Overall explanation
By working with process auditors to refine processes, teams can effectively deploy products without the hindrance of unnecessary impediments. This can encourage teams to work in a more agile way allowing for a smoother flow of the processes. Adding more tasks does not address the bottleneck issues the project is experiencing. Adding more work and overhead may increase the bottlenecks in the project. Before telling stakeholders there is nothing that can be done, it is best to research a solution. Doing away with current processes is a drastic decision that may be necessary, but only after research and conversations about the process engineering this answer suggests.

Although Kyle has typed out very detailed instructions for what he wants to be done, his teammates are not responding to his queries. Which of the following 5Cs of communication best describes which technique Kyle is not following?
A coherent, logical flow of ideas
Correct grammar and spelling

$35,000
$80,000
$20,000
Correct answer
$100,000
Overall explanation
The planned value is the amount the project should have spent to reach this point in the schedule. Because the project is scheduled to last one year with the work completed in part each month, month three represents 25 percent of the project, or $100,000. $20,000 is not the planned value. $35,000 is the actual cost. $80,000 is the earned value.

Eliza should inform her superiors regarding the archeological find. This find is likely outside the scope of her responsibility and should be handled at a higher level as there may be compliance issues or regulations to consider. Proceeding with the project is not the best choice, as Eliza should escalate the issue and allow management to decide on how best to move forward.

On which competency should the team training focus?
Managing stakeholders
Correct answer
Managing risk
Managing quality
Managing cost
Overall explanation
When managing risk, a team must be forward-looking in addition to learning from past mistakes. Documentation and tight quality assurance are important, but they are based on historical precedent, not potential future states. Managing costs is unlikely to prevent the issue at hand as there is no evidence of going over budget.

This was not in response to bankruptcy or a horrible event. The company’s board of directors wanted to replace the outgoing and retiring CEO with a fresh outlook and management style. The new CEO has not changed the customer’s core business, but he has begun to introduce a vision of a nimbler company that is attuned to the marketplace and can make changes quickly as needed. Darryl favors a traditional waterfall approach to project management. He notices that the project management office he joined starts to shake things up in approach and personnel. What should Darryl become well-versed in to anticipate changes that may be coming his way?
Correct answer
Get comfortable with agile project management in general.
Get better at Microsoft Project since it is a big company.
Become a scrum master.
Do not change because he was hired for his current skills.
Overall explanation
The new CEO’s general direction suggests an agile approach and mindset. At the very least, this will most likely translate into a hybrid approach. While the company may use Microsoft Project, it is not a sure bet just because they are big. Scrum is a specific agile discipline. Darryl would be best served by embracing an agile mindset and learning about multiple agile disciplines while retaining his waterfall knowledge in anticipation of various changes.

Hold a hallway meeting with those in the office and forward the meeting results to the entire team to keep everyone informed.
Send an email to the team and compile their responses.
Overall explanation
Claude should choose the solution that will involve all the team members for issue resolution.

Correct answer
Interpersonal communication
Small group communication
Public communication
Mass communication
Overall explanation
Interpersonal communication allows stakeholders to clarify their point of view without provoking a reaction from other stakeholders or team members. It can be a useful way of gaining incremental buy-in when holistic buy-in is difficult or impossible to obtain. Small group communications are useful for subject matter experts but are unlikely to yield consensus among large groups of stakeholders. Public communications are useful for quickly alerting large groups of users and stakeholders but are generally poor tools for gathering consensus. Mass communication, such as a website or video, is for large groups of stakeholders.

Today, two team members approach Hector with problems to report. Dora shows him a report indicating a few more defects in the project process and that quality needs to be improved, which may add time and cost to the project. After Dora immediately presents her problem, Benny informs Diego that there is a legal challenge to the project that may or may not be substantive. If proven true, the legal problem could cause the project to be terminated or create a costly lawsuit due to non-compliance. Which obstacle should Diego tackle first?
Tackle both problems at once
Deal with the quality problem. 
Correct answer
The legal problem is for the legal team - address the legal issue first.
Stop the project completely until both obstacles are resolved.
Overall explanation
Diego has a challenge here, but the most significant threat of the two is the legal challenge. Quality, cost, and time issues are challenges for any project, but a legal challenge resulting in invalidating the project is the most potent obstacle here. It may be nothing but Diego has an obligation to investigate and work with his legal team to determine the next steps. Even though it is tempting to deal with both issues simultaneously, the most pressing issue is the legalities of the compliance issue. Quality, cost, and time issues are challenges for any project and should be dealt with based on the priorities.

Privately congratulate the individual.
Give this individual a raise.
Email the individual's manager about their achievement.

Congratulate the individual in the next team meeting.
Overall explanation
Publicly congratulating the individual on their improvement will reinforce this behavior and encourage future good work. Giving the individual a raise is outside Nancy's scope in a weak matrix. Privately congratulating the individual would not be as impactful as doing so publicly.

Request for quotation (RFQ)
Correct answer
Request for proposal (RFP)
Overall explanation
A request for proposal (RFP) is used when there is a problem in the project, and the solution is not easy to determine. This document is the most formal of the "request for" documents and has strict procurement rules for content, timeline, and seller responses. A request for quotation (RFQ) is commonly used when more information is needed to satisfy the requirements and how much it will cost.

Ricardo should meet with each project team to set up a standard way to transfer knowledge between teams, ensuring each team is sharing information in a standardized way. Ricardo could accomplish this with a monthly meeting, a shared information radiator, or a web conferencing system. Assigning one team member to knowledge transfers is not ideal as this does not provide a standard approach for all teams to follow.

At the project level, the focus is on achieving the goals of the current project. The project manager will solicit knowledge from project managers or project leaders involved with other projects, and their experience can then be applied to the current project. The Project Management Office (PMO) is also an excellent source of knowledge, as it exists to define and maintain standards for project management within an organization.

Resistance to change is normal and healthy.
People are less resistant to change when they are part of the solution.
People are unlikely to accept new approaches blindly.
Correct answer
Workers are not happy with the current situation.

Question 63
Skipped
As the project manager of the Thrapp Project, Dana is working with the customer stakeholder, Gerry. Gerry has asked Dana to find a method to lessen the overall duration of the project. If Dana's company finishes ahead of schedule, Gerry has promised a bonus of $10,000 per day to the company. For activities that are effort-driven, what duration compression technique could Dana utilize here?
Fast-tracking
Correct answer
Crashing
Effort-driven activities cannot be compressed
Resource smoothing
Overall explanation
The correct answer is crashing, which enables Dana to add more labor to activities that are effort-driven. When more labor is added, the activity duration is reduced. Resource smoothing is the leveling of resources on non-critical path activities and is incorrect. This method does not reduce activity time. This response is incorrect because effort-driven activities are ideal activities that can be reduced through more labor. Fast-tracking is incorrect because it allows the project phases to overlap and is not the best choice for this question.

Jessica replaced a product owner after the previous product owner abruptly left the company. Before the first meeting with the project team, Ben, the scrum master, asks Jessica how she prefers to receive updates. What is the most likely reason for this question?
Ben is trying to build rapport with Jessica.
Ben was told to do this by his manager.
The prior product owner did not want to receive any updates.
Correct answer
Different individuals prefer to receive updates in different ways.
Overall explanation
Different individuals have different communication preferences, so asking Jessica in person allows Ben to communicate appropriately. Ben's manager directing him to do this is not a likely reason for this scenario. The prior product owner not wanting updates is not a likely reason for this question. While this will build rapport with Jessica, this is not the best answer.

Sharon is planning her resource distribution for a medical software development project. She considers putting Robert on the project but has recently heard that Robert is incredibly disruptive and bad for team morale. Sharon decides to proceed with the project plans without Robert as a team member as she wants to ensure that her project is successful. What kind of risk response strategy is this?
Transfer
Mitigate
Accept
Correct answer
Avoid
Overall explanation
This is an example of risk avoidance. By not putting Robert on the team, Sharon has avoided the risk of having Robert be disruptive to her project. This is not an example of transferring the risk because she has not moved the risk anywhere; she has avoided it. This is not an example of risk mitigation because no actions were taken to lessen the risk's probability; it was avoided altogether. This is not an example of acceptance because Sharon has decided to proceed without Robert, not include him in her team.

To figure out how many requirements can be completed in a sprint, which of the terms below describes the rating of the requirements?
Value analysis
Fist-to-five voting
Correct answer
Story points
Sprint backlog
Overall explanation
The correct answer is story points. User stories are written requirements, and story points rank task difficulty in order to complete a user story in a sprint. The sprint backlog is not a process that rates requirements to determine how many requirements can be finished in a sprint and is therefore incorrect. Value analysis is not a process that rates requirements to determine how many requirements can be finished in a sprint and is therefore incorrect.

You are a new project manager and much of your project team is new to the organization. Some of the project team members are confused as to their roles and responsibilities and other team members have verbalized their goals and work in the project. You want to work with this new team to make certain they can rely on each other, put the value of the project foremost in the project, and work together to reach the definition of done. Which one of the following choices should you not stress during this forming stage of the project?
Building trust
Resolving conflict
Active listening
Correct answer
Risk-taking
Overall explanation
Risk-taking is not an interpersonal skill that a project manager would apply in this scenario. Risk-taking must be in balance with the reward the risk may bring, but it is not an important conversation during the project team forming stage. Building trust is an interpersonal skill you would want to take and discuss with the new project team. Rules for resolving conflict and giving respect in the project are valuable activities for a new project team as they establish rules and guidelines for the team members to follow. Active listening is essential to team development as it helps the team and the project manager to really hear what other people are saying in the project.

Eric is the project manager for Project ELN, which is in its fifteenth week of deployment, has a CPI of 1.01 and an SPI of .96. A portion of the project has been outsourced to a vendor. The centralized contracting of the organization has issued a purchase order and contract for the procured work. Now, the vendor has reported the completion of all their assigned project work and requested payment from Eric's organization. What should Eric do next?
Extend the vendor's contract for more assignments in the project.
Correct answer
Verify if the vendor's work was completed satisfactorily.
Ask the project sponsor if the vendor can be paid.
Pay the vendor as the work is reported as complete.
Overall explanation
Eric should confirm that the vendor has completed Project ELN's work to satisfaction. This will allow Eric to take the next best step. Paying the vendor without inspecting completed work to confirm if it is satisfactory is not the best answer. The project manager or organizational representative should always inspect the completion of the project work prior to paying the invoice. The project sponsor will expect Eric, the project manager, to have the work inspected before paying the vendor. Extending the vendor's contract is not a good answer as Eric has not confirmed that the current work is complete.

Zane is a project manager at Camera Corporation and is planning a new project. The project is to create a new digital camera that is tiny, durable, and has a high resolution for photographers. During a recent stakeholder meeting to prioritize the product features, the stakeholders told Zane that every feature was of the highest priority. What should Zane do in this situation?
Correct answer
Work with the stakeholders to stack rank the tasks.
Agree, but assign different priorities on his own.
Prioritize every task as high.
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Overall explanation
While every task may be important, having everything labeled the highest priority will result in that losing its meaning. Zane should work with stakeholders to stack rank in their objectives. It is imperative to prioritize features; one approach is to utilize MoSCoW to sort and filter requirements from everything being of the highest priority. Prioritizing everything as high is not the best answer, as this takes away meaning from the value assigned to each requirement. Agreeing, then changing the priorities later, risks negatively impacting his relationship with his stakeholders. What is important to the project manager may not be important to the stakeholders. Escalating the situation to the steering committee is not the best option; they will expect Zane and the stakeholders to work together to find a resolution on the project.

One member of your team has recently been struggling with accomplishing his assigned tasks. Although his team members have asked him if anything is wrong, he only says that everything is fine. However, you recognize that the team member does need help but does not want to admit it. Which of Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a team best describes the scenario above?
Avoidance of Accountability
Fear of Conflict
Lack of Commitment
Correct answer
Absence of Trust
Overall explanation
The fear of being vulnerable to team members prevents the building of trust within the team. Such things characterize vulnerability-based trust as saying, 'I need help,' 'I screwed up,' or 'I made an error.' Fear of conflict is not demonstrated in this scenario. It is only in rare situations where struggling to accomplish assigned tasks would involve conflict with other people. Lack of commitment rather implies that the team member questions the goals and does not offer support. Avoidance of accountability happens when team members shun meetings and responsibility for the work they have, or have not, completed.

You are experienced in this approach and your projects are consistently done on time and on budget. Stakeholders and the project team are happy with your approach to projects. Your organization, however, has decided to adapt to agile methodologies. What must you do to prepare for this change?
Speak to your manager about the change. You are already proven successful with the waterfall approach.
Stop all projects until you have a complete understanding of agile methodologies, including attending training sessions.
Correct answer
Determine what it will take for the transition and what it will take to prepare for the change.
Adapt to agile thinking
Overall explanation
Assessing what is needed to adapt to agile methodologies, including the current knowledge and practices already in place, will help give a greater understanding of what is required to shift to agile practices. This can include training, coaching, and reading books as you prepare to move to agile practices. Having agile thinking and being agile are not the same thing. You will need to prepare for the new methodology. Stopping all projects is not the best choice as you still need to complete that work as you prepare for the new approach to project management. You may be successful with the current methodology, but your employer has selected a new project management approach, so you will need to research the business value, learn the new approach, and determine how you can best work in the new environment.

You are a senior project manager for your organization and stakeholders enjoy working with you as project manager. Currently, you are implementing organizational project management (OPM), mainly through incorporating mentoring initiatives. Although your top management is aware of the benefits that this implementation can bring, they are reluctant to take on mentors' roles as they state they are too busy to handle the extra responsibility. Which of the following actions should you take next to implement OPM?
Correct answer
Establishing a rewards system to encourage mentors to participate.
Give up on the implementation as top management does not want to support it.
Delegating this responsibility to middle-level managers and supervisors.
Hiring a third party that provides mentorship workshops to the organization.
Overall explanation
Establishing a rewards system will encourage top-level management to participate in the program – if management is interested in the reward. This is a good example of an exam question as none of the choices are really that good, but you will still need to choose the best option presented. Delegating mentorship responsibilities to middle-level management will not project the program's right image if top-level executives are unwilling to participate. While hiring a third party may be beneficial in the short term, they are not permanent employees, and the workshops they conduct will only be temporary. It would be best not to give up on implementing OPM as sustained leadership is cited as a critical success factor for its successful implementation.

In addition to covering the project outline, scope, and background information, what other topic was Juline likely to discuss in the project kickoff meeting?
Government requirements for acceptability
The risk register
The stakeholder matrix
Correct answer
Project team responsibilities
Overall explanation
Going over the team responsibilities in the kickoff meeting is an excellent way to set the team up for success. Juline should have discussed the roles of the team members and expectations of the team's involvement. While this cannot be at a high level because detailed planning likely has not happened yet, it ensures everyone has a sense of who will do what in the project. It is important to cover the team's responsibilities in this meeting. The risk register is not likely to be discussed in the project's kickoff meeting.

Elijah finds that his manager engages stakeholders much more frequently during the project than he has seen in past projects. How does the manager, Lucas, find this practice beneficial?
It is Lucas' belief that frequent meetings are a good respite from heads-down work.
Instead of being singled out for overstepping boundaries, the stakeholders stay in their own lanes.
All stakeholders will become better acquainted with each other.
Correct answer
Frequent stakeholder engagement allows the team to develop stronger problem-solving skills, receive valuable ideas and input, and take ownership.
Overall explanation
A collaborative approach in agile practices enables the team to get input, ideas, and feedback from stakeholders. Because the team has participated in decision-making, they will take ownership of the project's successes and failures. While some team members would surely like a break from work, this is not the best answer for this question. By simply working together on a daily basis, stakeholders can quickly assess each other's capabilities and quirks. In an agile project, stakeholders learn that a highly collaborative team is needed to have a successful project.

Procurement documentation is the correct answer. Since you are about to exercise the conduct procurement process, the project's procurement documentation records provide insight into legal matters, bid documents, statements of work, cost estimates, and the source selection criteria. Product requirements are the tangible and intangible features of the product being developed. Source selection criteria are the requirements that a vendor must meet before being selected and include capability, capacity, and relevant experience, among other criteria.

After meeting with each team to determine what has caused the breakdown in the delivery of information, she finds that the required strategy for communication is not in place. What is the name of the plan that is needed for project stakeholders?
Correct answer
Stakeholder engagement plan
Project management plan
Risk management plan
Requirements management plan
Overall explanation
The stakeholder engagement plan is an essential component of the initial project management plan. The stakeholder engagement plan identifies the stakeholders and the strategies and actions needed to define the project stakeholder's communication and involvement. The plan can be updated as the need for communication changes. If the communications management plan were present as a choice, it would be tempting, but the question states which plan is needed for the project stakeholders. The project management plan is not the most precise answer. While the project management plan includes the stakeholder engagement plan, the best answer is the most precise answer. The risk management plan addresses the project risk processes, not stakeholder engagement. The requirements management plan addresses how requirements will be elicited, identified, and managed.

Correct answer
Rework
Overall explanation
The correct answer is rework, which is the result of an internal failure cost, and this is an example of the cost of quality nonconformance. Project team training is an example of the quality conformance cost and is therefore incorrect. Random quality audits are an incorrect response because they are not a cost related to nonconformance.

Ian is a project manager for the Sumi Corporation. He is currently managing a project that is 60 percent complete. However, the project is scheduled to be 80 percent completed by today. The project budget is $984,000. Ian has spent ten percent more than what was planned to be reached by this point in the project timeline. Management is concerned that the project is going to be grossly over budget. What is the estimate at completion based on this information?
Correct answer
$1,443,200
$3,522,104
-$459,200
$984,000
Overall explanation
To find the answer to this question, you will need several components. First, the Estimate at Completion uses the formula of Budget at Completion divided by the Cost Performance Index. To find the Cost Performance Index, you will use the formula of Earned Value divided by Actual Costs. In this question, the Actual Costs are described as ten percent more than what the project should be worth, which is the Planned Value plus ten percent of the Planned Value. The Planned Value is $787,200, and the actual costs, therefore, are $865,920. This means the Earned Value is $590,400, and the cost performance index is .68. The estimate at completion, BAC/CPI, is $1,443,200. -$459,200 is not a valid calculation of the estimate at completion, so this choice is incorrect. $984,00 is not a valid calculation of the estimate at completion, so this choice is incorrect. $2,522,104 is not a valid calculation of the estimate at completion, so this choice is incorrect.

Overall explanation
Amanda should keep an eye on the new government as they may pass regulation that impacts Project K. Logging the event into the PMIS is essential but not the best thing for Amanda to do.

The requirements will allow customers to pay for their order online rather than wait for an invoice from Siesta Manufacturing. What should Sterling do?
Tell the stakeholder that the project is already underway and no additional work can be added.
Correct answer
Refer the stakeholder to the product owner to add the items.
Ask the project team if they think the new stories are useful.
Work with the stakeholder to understand the need behind these stories and how they contribute to the project overall.
Overall explanation
Referring the stakeholder to the product owner to add the items is the best choice. The product owner is the liaison between the businesspeople and the project. The product owner is responsible for adding the requirements into the product backlog, so it is best that the stakeholder works with the product owner. Agile projects welcome and expect change, so this is not the best answer to the question. The project team does not need to approve the requirements, so this is not the best answer. Working with the stakeholder to understand the need behind these stories is a good second choice, but the user has already explained why the requirements are needed.

You are the coach for a software development project using an agile approach. Your team is physically located in one place, but some team members report they need some quiet time to focus on their work. What should you do next?
Purchase headphones for the team members that need quiet time.
Correct answer
Implement caves and commons for the project team.
Install cubicles for quiet workspaces.
Remove those team members from the common workplace to cubicles.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to use a caves and commons approach. Commons are the public workspace the team is currently using, but caves would be quiet, isolated areas for the team members to focus on their work as needed. In agile, team members should not be removed entirely from the common workspace. Cubicles may be isolated; they are not likely to be quiet if installed in the common workplace environment.

The hotel project has just reached the fifty percent milestone. Internally, the stakeholders are very pleased with the project and how Carlos has led the project. Management views the vision and milestones reached as being aligned with the results. Externally, the customers are confused by the project and view it as being behind schedule and potentially not what they expected. Stakeholders do not have much to say about the project – other than asking when the work will be done. What can Carlos do to solve this problem?
Examine the complaints to see if they are actual stakeholders.
Nothing, if those close to the project are pleased, then all is well.
Correct answer
Follow the communications management plan to give more info to stakeholders.
Ask for your sponsor's help.
Overall explanation
The communications management plan will help Carlos examine what information the customers expect and should receive from the project. This should be the first thing he examines to confirm that he is communicating as the stakeholders expect. Next, he should meet with the stakeholders to address any of their concerns and be transparent about the project's progress. Examining the complaints is a tempting choice, but he should first see that the stakeholders are receiving the information they expect from the project. It could be stakeholders are unaware of the progress because he has not been communicating as was promised. Doing nothing will almost always be an incorrect choice. In this scenario, Carlos needs better communication and likely better stakeholder engagement. Asking for the sponsor's help is not the first choice or best choice in this scenario. Never go to management with a problem unless you also have a proposed solution. Carlos is operating in a strong matrix, so he has a fair amount of authority over the project.

Question 96
Skipped
In a team meeting, an engineer points out that the price of leasing a required server is on sale if an agreement is signed within the month. If the team decides to go ahead and sign a contract to lease the server within the month, what kind of risk response strategy is this?
Correct answer
Enhancing
Mitigating
Sharing
Exploiting
Overall explanation
This is an example of enhancing a risk. Enhancing a risk means you are actively working to increase your project's probability of a positive impact. This is not an example of exploiting, as exploiting refers to changing the project to ensure the risk or opportunity occurs. Because the server was a requirement that would have been leased anyways, there is no change to the project. This is an example of a positive risk because it will result in financial savings. This is not an example of sharing as there is no indication in this scenario that the project team will be sharing this equipment. Because the risk is positive or an opportunity, mitigation is not an option. Mitigation is a risk strategy done for threats, not opportunities.

Charlie is in the initiation phase of a project. Although he is an experienced project manager, he has little experience with the type of project he is about to manage. However, his organization has completed projects which are very similar in scope, timeline, and cost, and the project managers that worked on these assignments are still around. Charlie decides to seek some of them out to learn what to expect and borrow project management resources like the stakeholder engagement matrix. Which level of knowledge is required?
Correct answer
Project-level
Portfolio-level
Surface-level
Individual-level
Overall explanation
Project-level knowledge is typically spread among project managers, leaders, and team members. These resources typically store useful project deliverables that can be used on or tailored to other projects. Individual-level knowledge is required when a single employee performs a task or tasks. This level of knowledge is unlikely to be enough. Portfolio-level knowledge usually requires knowledge of several programs within an organization. This level of knowledge may be overkill. Surface-level knowledge means the learner has a shallow or basic understanding of the concept being learned.

Eve is the project manager for Project Westward, which is in its ninth week of implementation, is $5,000.00 over a $100,000.00 budget and one week behind schedule. Recently Eve noticed a team member working on a deliverable that was not part of Project Westward's scope but will provide value to the project. The change was requested in an email to the worker from the project customer. What should Eve do?
Correct answer
Stop the work but submit a change request.
Stop the work and direct the team member to another task.
Escalate the issue to the team member's manager.
Do nothing. The task will benefit the project.
Overall explanation
Eve should ask the team member to stop work and submit a change request. This will ensure the change is controlled and will move it into the project's scope. Integrated change control ensures the scope is analyzed and considers time and cost adjustments that must be made for the change. Doing nothing risks an uncontrolled change negatively impacting the project. The customer wants the change but must be willing to allot time and funds for the work. The team member's manager is unlikely to be able to assist in this scenario. Redirecting the team member without putting in a change request will result in the project losing out on a potential benefit and may upset the stakeholder.

Tom is a project manager for ABC, Corp. He was recently put in charge of the UI team. The UI team has a history of completing projects by utilizing positional power to move their assigned tasks to the top of resources to-do lists. Tom does not want to upset the team's flow and decides to let the team continue getting things done utilizing positional power. Tom is approached by the PMO director and is informed that he will need to tell his team that they are no longer allowed to use their positional power and must abide by the same rules as everyone else. The director of the PMO is utilizing what type of power?
Personal
Expert
Correct answer
Positional
Forcing
Overall explanation
The director of the PMO is utilizing positional power. Positional power is considered authoritative and is granted in the organization based on position. Since the PMO director has decided, Tom is obligated to follow the directive based on positional power. Personal power is the authority one has over others, such as politicians or parents. Expert power comes from mastery of a certain topic, such as being a developer for twenty years. Forcing power means the person with authority forces their decision on the people without the power.

Joe is a project manager working on a new app that is one week behind. However, the primary reason the project is behind is directly related to the graphic design team. How should Joe communicate the missed deadline to the stakeholders?
Correct answer
During the morning meeting, the graphic design team should communicate to Joe the reason for the missed deadline. Joe should meet with the graphic design team, and together, they should determine the corrective action to bring the project back on track. Joe should communicate the reason for the missed deadline and the corrective action to the stakeholders in person.
Joe should communicate to the stakeholders that the project is one week behind and then meet with the graphic design team to determine the reason(s) for the holdup.
Joe should discuss with the graphic design team the reason(s) they are behind and determine the best corrective action to get the project back on track. Then communicate the corrective action via email to the stakeholders.
Joe should meet with the graphic design team to determine the corrective action for bringing the project back on track, regardless of the issue, and communicate that everything is going as planned in the weekly update.
Overall explanation
As a project manager, you must always be ethical. Deadlines are never personal and should be maintained. If a deadline is threatened, it should be communicated at the earliest possible time to avoid prolonged disruptions. News regarding threatened deadlines should be delivered in person when possible. This is not the best choice as Joe is determining the correct action without the graphics team. The graphics design team should be involved in the decision. This choice does not resolve the lateness of the project. It is also better to communicate bad news along with a proposed solution or intent. Joe and the team should work together to find a resolution to the issue, identify the needed corrective action, and then communicate the plan to the stakeholders.

Wesley is hoping with the in-person meeting to build trust with the rest of the team, so they are willing to share their experiences with everyone else. Additionally, he knows that every team member has relevant experience with the project, so he would like them to share those experiences with the group. What type of knowledge does this scenario best describe?
Project knowledge
Organizational knowledge
Explicit knowledge
Correct answer
Tacit knowledge
Overall explanation
In this scenario, Wesley wants to build trust to enable them to fully understand and leverage their prior work experience with each other. Tacit knowledge is a personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate and share, such as beliefs, experiences, and insights. Organizational knowledge is about managing programs or portfolios. Project knowledge is knowledge about implementing the tools and techniques to achieve the goals of the project. Explicit knowledge can easily be codified using symbols such as words, numbers, and pictures.

Many of the project members are working remotely, and at the first team meeting, Isaiah asked everyone how their names should be pronounced. What is the most likely reason Isaiah did this?
To break the ice and get people involved.
Correct answer
To ensure that everyone knows everyone's correct names.
Isaiah is unsure how to call his team members.
Isaiah is curious about other team members' backgrounds.
Overall explanation
By ensuring everyone knows how to pronounce each other's names correctly, Isaiah helps build team morale and break down potential communication barriers. Breaking the ice is a good idea but not the best answer to this question. Being unsure of how to pronounce someone's name is a good reason, but not the best answer in this case.

Overall explanation
Adaline and the product owner should review all outstanding requests and add them to the backlog. Once entered, the product owner will be able to prioritize those requests. Before meeting with stakeholders, Adaline should ensure their ideas have been recorded. Forwarding the e-mails and instant messages to the project team is not the best method to capture potential stories. Brainstorming is not ideal as many ideas have already been submitted.

He demands that the team refilm the footage and add some extra features. After the presentation, Stephanie's team starts blaming each other for why the video did not meet the supervisor's expectations. Which of Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a team best describes the scenario above?
Fear of conflict
Lack of commitment
Absence of trust
Correct answer
Avoidance of accountability
Overall explanation
The need to avoid interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding one another accountable for their behaviors and performance. It is too hard and emotionally draining to be constructively direct with their peers. If the team members cannot share their past experiences and present thoughts, they will not trust each other enough to honestly discuss future goals for the team, which is not the case in this scenario. If the team members are concerned that their honest comments may throw off balance the ease they have created by holding back, then everyone will keep holding back. If the team members do not believe in the team's primary goal, ultimately, they will not support it.

Mia is working on a new project with Bolt Consulting. One of the project stakeholders wants to know why she considers the scope statement so important in the methodology of project management. How does Mia answer the stakeholder's question?
Before any change authorization, the plan must be consulted.
The EVM and project plan must work together to assess the risk involved with proposed changes.
Before a change is approved or declined, the project manager must document the change.
Correct answer
The project scope statement guides all change requests to decide if the change is in or out of scope.
Overall explanation
Whether a change is in or out of scope, the scope statement acts as a point of reference. The EVM is not an issue in this scenario; therefore, this response is incorrect. Mandatory consultation of the plan before change authorization is incorrect because it is too vague a response. Based on historical factors or other information, some changes may be made orally and declined immediately.

Darrell is a project manager for the Jewin Corporation and has a critical project that was just approved. Due to competitive pressure, the executives ask Darrel to rush through the estimation phase to apply for federal funding. Even though all of his team members have not yet been hired for the project, Darrell completes the estimating activities on his own, based on his previous experience. What risk has Darrell taken concerning estimating activity durations without proper consultation?
The activity durations will remain the same.
Correct answer
The activity durations are likely to change.
The activity durations are likely to decrease.
The activity durations are likely to increase.
Overall explanation
Estimating activity durations without input from the project team is risky as the project team members' skillsets are unknown and may differ from those estimated and planned. The activity durations being likely to increase, decrease, or remain the same is unlikely. We do not know if the activity will increase or decrease, but it is expected that their durations will change from a rushed estimate.

Build a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Consult with subject matter experts.
Plan every iteration at the start of the project.
Correct answer
Loosely group items by quarterly releases.
Overall explanation
Grouping tasks by quarterly releases will allow the project to plan longer term while still allowing flexibility as things change. The product owner should participate, if not lead, the planning of releases and what deliverables are loosely assigned to which release. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is used in predictive projects, not agile, so this choice is incorrect.

Mitigation
Secondary risk

Related risk
Overall explanation
Risks "leftover" after a risk response is called residual risk. Residual risks are often small and accepted, but not always. A secondary risk is a risk that occurs because of a risk response.

You are the project manager for your organization and manage a hybrid project with ten team members. One of your team members, Jerod, is a wonderful and productive team member. However, underneath the surface, he usually has an idea of what may happen next in the project and tries to position himself and the project work accordingly. However, sometimes his ideas do not often mesh with reality. Jerod is not manipulative or cutthroat in his actions, but he always plans, anticipates trends, and makes sure that he is learning new things. Some of his team members say he is scheming more than planning. Jerod takes a personality test, and unsurprisingly he is categorized as a strategist. Since Jerod is always making plans for his career, what is the best way to ensure his plans meet the company's goals?
Force him to share his ideas.
Correct answer
Create a development plan for Jerod.
Offer financial rewards for Jerod's work.
Promote him to management.
Overall explanation
Creating a development plan for Jerod is a great way to work with him and facilitate the benefit of his mind and planning. This also helps you guide Jerod to expected results in the project work. Financial rewards are always a great motivator, but a development plan is a more robust answer for Jerod. Financial rewards could be part of this plan. Forcing Jerod to share or do something he does not want to do is never a way to motivate a person. Promoting Jerod is likely not within the project manager's authority, so this is not the best choice presented.

One of your stakeholders, Julie, has heard that your project is currently one month behind schedule, and she fears the project may be slipping even farther behind schedule. Julie would like to determine if the rumors are true, and she wants a definitive answer. How can Julie best do this?
Call the project team members and demand answers.
Interview the project team collectively without you.
Perform earned value management on the current schedule.
Correct answer
Review the project's key performance indicators.
Overall explanation
Reviewing the project's key performance indicators will let Julie know how the project is doing. Key performance indicators are metrics for project components, such as time, cost, scope, and quality. Calling the project team and demanding answers is not the best choice as the team may not be aware of additional schedule issues, though there may be. In addition, stakeholders should speak with the project manager, not the project team, about performance. Interviewing the team without the project manager would be inappropriate. The team may feel uncomfortable, and this can create a dynamic of mistrust among the stakeholders and team members. Performing earned value management on the current schedule would give some insight into the schedule's performance, but this will not confirm if the project is slipping farther from the planned schedule.

The project is scheduled to last 18 months, and the project team will only require the equipment for the project periodically throughout the project. However, Chelsea has decided to rent one of the pieces of machinery for the project's duration. This specific piece of equipment costs $785 per month to rent. This is an example of which of the following choices?
Correct answer
Fixed costs
Variable costs
Indirect costs
Parametric costs
Overall explanation
The correct response is fixed cost. The example explains a fixed cost expense per month of the equipment regardless of its use. Indirect costs are an incorrect choice because this is a cost attributed directly to the project's work. A variable cost can change in the project; the cost in this scenario is "fixed" at $785 per month. Parametric costs, a value used to calculate cost per use, per ton, or unit, are incorrect. It may seem that this scenario represents a parametric cost, but there is no historical information to base a parametric model.

Asha is the project manager for a project that spans five countries and utilizes English, French, and Spanish. She will significantly rely on a virtual project. Which choice below is a benefit of using a team that is collocated?
Because it is dispersed, the project team is self-led.
Project costs are significantly reduced because the team is in the same physical location.
Correct answer
The project team's ability to work together is enhanced because they are in the same physical location.
Communication increases because the project team is dispersed.
Overall explanation
When all project team members are in the same physical location, they are collocated. Collocation increases their ability to work as a team. Communication will increase because the project team is dispersed when utilizing a virtual team. However, the question asks what is a benefit of utilizing a collocated team, so this choice is not applicable to the scenario. A dispersed team is not automatically self-led. You can utilize a predictive, hybrid, or agile approach with virtual teams, but the non-collocation doesn’t make a team self-led. Project costs are not necessarily reduced when a team is collocated. Costs may increase in some instances due to travel expenses in bringing the team members together to complete the project.

Limits all discussion from a single person to two minutes or less per topic
Correct answer

Overall explanation
The best choice is to assist quieter team members by allowing them to speak. The simplest way to accomplish what is needed is to help the team members who have not added thoughts. Limiting discussion, as a rule, is not a good idea in a collaborative environment, and this choice is not the most effective for ensuring full team participation.

It is bottom-up estimating
It is regression analysis
Correct answer
It is less accurate

Overall explanation
The correct answer is analogous estimating is not as accurate as other methods of estimation. Bottom-up estimating is incorrect because it starts with nothing and adds up the project modeling.

Organizational process assets
PERT
Overall explanation
Lucas is using an analogous estimating approach. Remember this estimating approach by the "analogy" between the two like projects. Parametric is incorrect because it uses a parameter, such as three hours per unit. PERT (program evaluation and review technique) is incorrect because it uses an average of the optimistic, most likely, time estimates for each activity and the pessimistic time estimates for each activity.

$64,999
Correct answer
$26,000

Overall explanation
The correct response is $26,000. To calculate the variance, subtract the actual costs of $65,000 from the EV (earned value) of $39,000. To get the EV, take the 30 percent project completion rate against the BAC. The project is considered 30 percent complete because it is scheduled for 10 months, is now in month three, and is on schedule. $39,000 is incorrect because that is not the number you get when applying the correct calculation. $64,999 is incorrect because it is not the number you get when applying the calculation correctly. $65,000 is incorrect because it is not the number you get when calculating properly.

Money for training
Money for overtime
Funds for technology
More human resources because more people will speed up the work
Overall explanation
Whenever there is a new technology in an exam question, lean towards offering additional training. Training ensures that everyone has the same message and approach to learning the technology and this alleviates risk and errors within the project. While crashing the project does add more people and more costs, this is not the best choice presented. People will need to be trained on how to use the new technology. Overtime may or may not be needed in the technology – this is not a great choice for the scenario. Funds for technology do not address the learning curve in the scenario, so this is not the best answer presented.

You are the project manager of the Greenleaf Project for your organization. You are working with your team to complete a qualitative analysis of several risks that have been identified. Some of the risks in the project are significant, and you will be moving those risks into quantitative analysis. Some of the risks have a low probability and low impact during qualitative analysis. What should you do with these risk events?
Accept the risks and dismiss them.
Correct answer
Document them in a low-level risk watchlist.
Document them in the risk response plan.
Move them to quantitative analysis.
Overall explanation
Risks that have low probability and low impact during qualitative risk analysis are documented in a low-level risk watchlist. The watchlist is periodically reviewed to see if the probability or impact of the risk events has changed. These risk events do not move to quantitative analysis, as they have a low-risk score. Quantitative risk analysis is for risks that require more study and generally have a higher probability and/or impact. These risks will not have a risk response, so they are only monitored, not added to a risk response plan. You would not dismiss these risks. They need to be added to a low-level risk watchlist and reviewed periodically.

You are the senior project manager for your organization. During the last two years, your company has experienced economic hardships, making raises and bonuses something that have not been an option. Another project manager has recently left the organization and as a result, you have inherited a project team that is primarily self-motivated and eager to grow.  The team you have inherited has stayed on task and has continued to achieve progress even though they have not been rewarded financially for an extended time. You desire to keep the team motivated and give them hope for the future. What is the best incentive that you can provide for your project team?
The promise of a raise when the company improves.
Give out low-cost prizes for employee performance.
Nothing, since they are already motivated.
Correct answer
Create a career development plan or program for motivated employees.
Overall explanation
The project team described here maps along with McGregor's Theory Y. While most employees appreciate raises or perhaps a prize, the type of team described here is most likely to thrive when offered a chance to further their skills, experience, and stature. You cannot promise something uncertain and outside of your authority as the project manager. A high-performing employee gets raises as a matter of course and is less likely to be influenced by a prize. Low-cost prizes, such as polo shirts or coffee mugs, are nice, especially when funds are tight and the team understands this, but you should always choose the best option. In this case, a career development plan shows the value the organization has in its employees. While this team seems to be doing well despite the lack of incentives, a good project manager should always work to get the most out of the team. A focus on career development could take this team to greater heights.

Devin wants to be proactive in ensuring the company remains legally compliant and begins researching how the legislation would directly impact his business. Which of the following options are not a guideline to analyze the consequences of non-compliance?
Track and manage the review and approval activities related to compliance requirements
Defining the legal, regulatory, and other constraints
Correct answer
Track and manage the benefits realization of maintaining the status quo
Defining parts of the potential solution subject to compliance requirements
Overall explanation
Tracking and managing the benefits realization of the status quo is not one of the guidelines to analyzing the consequences of non-compliance. The options' missing guideline is tracking and managing the risks and risk responses related to compliance requirements. Defining the legal, regulatory, and other constraints are guidelines to ensure compliance in the project. Defining parts of the potential solution subject to compliance requirements is important as it helps the project manager and team understand what must be defined as compliance. Tracking and managing the review and approval activities related to compliance requirements helps the project manager and team plan for the inspections for compliance.

Victor is the scrum master for Project Sky, which has a budget of $125,000. During planning, he noticed several risk events with a high chance of occurring and could severely impact the project. After performing quantitative analysis, it appears that one risk, in particular, has a probability of .80 and an impact of $54,000. What risk response is Victor likely to choose for these risks?
Cancel Project Sky
Correct answer
Mitigate
Accept
Transfer
Overall explanation
Mitigation would attempt to reduce the impact or likelihood of the risk. Victor would need to see if he can spend additional funds or time to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risks. Transferring risk moves the risk to a third party. Accepting is not a good option, given the high likelihood and impact. Canceling the project is not the best option as these risks could be transferred.

As a multi-million-dollar bridge restoration project manager, you have diligently collected the technical specifications and standards to rehabilitate the structure. You finally got approvals to start construction. You are excited about initiating the construction phase and have authorized your project team to create purchase order requests required by your contractors to begin their efforts. Before long, you receive multiple calls from your construction leads expressing concerns about the procurement department rejecting the purchase orders. Due to the PO's dollar amount, the vendor needs to go through additional screening, and additional approval is required from the Director of Procurement. What likely happened in this scenario that led to the rejections?
The team member submitted the PO for the wrong contractor, triggering a false alarm.
The contractor's price was too high for the work being performed.
The director of procurement was not listed in the stakeholder register.
Correct answer
The project manager missed procurement governance criteria.
Overall explanation
The project manager should have consulted with the corporate procurement governance requirements to avoid this issue. Projects need to integrate into the organization that they are performing. There is nothing in the question that suggests the contractor's price is too high. The scenario does not suggest that the PO was submitted to the wrong contractor.

Frank is the scrum master for Project Daytime, which is in its third iteration. The team is performing well. Recently a team member noted that some project tasks appear to be dependent on other work that is not included in Project Daytime but comes from another project in the organization. What should Frank do with this information?
Assign the team member to close the gaps in the project.
Have the project team work extra hours to cover the gaps.
Correct answer
Identify the dependencies and add appropriate tasks to the backlog.
Do nothing. The product owner owns the backlog.
Overall explanation
Frank should identify which tasks have missing dependencies then add tasks to the backlog to address those dependencies. This can mean coordinating with the other project teams, working with the product owner, or having the teams meet to discuss timelines and coordinating efforts. Doing nothing risks the project missing critical tasks as the project could be waiting on external dependencies. Working extra hours is not the best choice as another project team is already performing the work in the organization. Assigning someone to close the gaps is not the best choice. Closing the gaps is a vague definition of what needs to happen. The best solution is to coordinate with the other project team for the needed deliverables.

Facilitate a requirements workshop with key stakeholders to formulate user stories.
Perform a job shadowing exercise with the intended end-users of the existing software.
Conduct interviews with each stakeholder to determine each of their requirements.
Develop a survey and distribute it to all key stakeholders to ascertain the product requirements.
Overall explanation
You should facilitate a requirements workshop for the key stakeholders. Workshops can be used to determine functional requirements and allow key stakeholders to formulate user stories. A survey can be used in some instances, but it is not the most effective approach for this scenario. Interviewing stakeholders is an effective requirements elicitation technique, but a requirements workshop with all key stakeholders is much more effective in this scenario. Job shadowing, or observation, can be effective to learn how the stakeholders use a solution, but in this scenario, the organization is implementing a new project management approach, so shadowing would not be very effective.

Management decides they would like to work on Project Deux. Of the following responses, which is the opportunity cost?
$5,000

Nominal group technique
Affinity diagram creations

The correct response is the nominal group technique, a technique where the project manager asks for as many ideas and solutions as possible. Then, to help guide the requirements development, the group ranks the concepts. Mind mapping is incorrect because it does not rank ideas but shows the relationship between them. Brainstorming is similar to the nominal group technique but is an incorrect response because it does not rank the identified concepts. Affinity diagram creations is an incorrect response because it is defined as something that gathers different ideas and puts them in like groups for further analysis.

Your organization took on a substantial project, knowing the project's components are outside of the core business and specialty. As a project manager, you enlisted your procurement department for their expertise and awarded the specialty tasks to a vendor for completion through a contract on a time-and-materials (T&M) basis. Based on the agreed-upon terms, the initial contract amount was $50,000 over six months. However, when the project was completed, the total contract value was $150,000 over 18 months. Looking back, what mechanism could you, as a PM, have suggested in preventing this unlimited cost growth and schedule change?
Use of a fixed-price contract.
Correct answer
Placing a Price, Threshold, and Schedule Restriction on the T&M contract.
Imposing a penalty based on impact (cost, timeline).
A service level agreement.
Overall explanation
The use of not-to-exceed values and time limits on T&M contracts helps prevent unlimited cost growth or schedule changes. A fixed-price contract or a service level agreement may be an option but not applicable as a solution to this example since the buyer used a T&M contract. Imposing a penalty based on impact is not commonly used on T&M contracts. A service-level agreement is used for internal agreements between lines of business or departments, such as the IT department supporting the IT needs of the accounting department.

Right now, Jeremy is completing an overhaul of the security protocols for the company's shared resources on several servers. The functional manager has a high degree of influence on the project decisions, but she has little interest in Jeremy's project. However, the project cannot be successfully completed without the functional manager's support. What stakeholder management strategy should you utilize for the functional manager?
Monitor the functional manager's actions.
Correct answer
Keep the functional manager satisfied.
Keep the functional manager informed.
Manage the functional manager closely.
Overall explanation
In a typical power/interest grid, the functional manager falls under a high power/low interest stakeholder category. For this reason, the functional manager should be kept satisfied. You would not manage the functional manager closely as they have high power, but low interest. You would keep the functional manager informed if they had low power and low interest. Monitoring the functional manager's actions is applicable if the manager had low power and high interest.

Quality audits are a part of planning time.
Correct answer
Quality is planned into a project, as opposed to being inspected into the project.
More time is needed because this is a first-time, first-use project.
Planning for a project this large, with quality being a top priority, is mandatory.
Overall explanation
The best answer is that quality is planned into a project, not inspected; planning requires time.

Innovation
Achieving target costs
Meeting key milestones
Providing quality work
Overall explanation
Innovation allows a project to progress more rapidly or otherwise more efficiently without a prohibitive increase in cost or time. It considers the status quo and creates a solution with similar resources. Achieving target costs is not directly applicable, even though innovation typically leads to achieving target costs as an indirect effect. Quality is an esoteric term that must be defined (What is quality to one person may not be quality to another.)

They have asked the PMO to outline a communication strategy that addresses both internal and external stakeholders and team members. Why is it important that a unified message be relayed to both internal and external stakeholders and team members?
It is not that important; leadership is just trying to create work for the PMO.
If the message is aligned, it will be easier for those who write the emails and company statements to convey the unified set of principles when necessary.
Correct answer
Having a strategic alignment that communicates from the inside out helps employees stay motivated while building trust with team members and stakeholders alike.
There should not be a unified alignment of communication. What happens within the company is of no concern to the outside stakeholders.
Overall explanation
By emphasizing unified communication, an organization expresses its desire to be transparent and shows its employees that they are just as important as the outside stakeholders. Communication of organizational principles provides an understanding that allows team members to work cohesively with stakeholders while accomplishing project completion for the organization's further growth. It may be easier to have a similar message that can be conveyed, but this is not the best choice presented. Leadership will not waste the time of employees, so this is not the best choice.

Abdul is a project stakeholder and he is concerned about the lack of communication in the project. He and some other stakeholders say that they have not received a single status report during the project. To address the concerned stakeholders, what is the first thing the project manager should do?

The project manager should review the communications management plan to understand the stakeholders' concerns thoroughly.
The project manager should immediately get any missing reports to the stakeholders.
The project manager should consult with the stakeholders to determine which report they are looking for and follow up with an update to the communications management plan.
The project manager should update the communications management plan to include the stakeholders.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is to review the communications management plan to determine what is missing or what needs to be corrected. This plan will define who will receive what information, when they will receive it, and the modality of the communication. Before the project manager distributes the missing reports to the stakeholders, she should confirm that the stakeholders are to receive the reports. The communications management plan will define what stakeholders need what information, when they need the information, and the expected modality of the information.

A commercial duration estimating database is the correct response because it is a solid resource in which to confirm or base time estimates. Local contractors are an incorrect response because the question does not say if the contractors are local to the Upper Peninsula or to Alabama. Additionally, local contractors are not the best source for time estimate confirmation.

Have each member write a short biography and share it with the team.
Require each team member to learn the primary language of all members of the team.
Have team members send photos of themselves to each other.
Overall explanation
By pairing team members on a task or iteration, they learn how to react and deal with each other; it gives them the opportunity to talk one-on-one more frequently. Sending photos and writing a biography is ineffective because it does not allow team members to discover each other’s goals and work ethics. While admirable, learning each member’s primary language is not realistic for most projects.

Eric is a project team member for Project Boise, three weeks into its implementation, $4,000 over budget, and one week ahead of schedule. At a recent team meeting, his project manager was reviewing risk triggers. Eric is unfamiliar with this concept. What is the project manager's most likely response when asked?
Correct answer
They are the warning signs a risk is likely to happen.
They are what make positive risks happen.
The project management office mandates them.
They trigger the steering committee to act on the risk event.
Overall explanation
Risk triggers are the precursors to a risk happening in the project. They are important to examine to prepare the team for an upcoming risk. Risk triggers do not make positive risks happen. Risk triggers do not trigger the steering committee to act. The project management office mandating risk triggers is not the best answer for this question.

Question 162
Skipped
A project manager is using their expert judgment to assess some organizational changes at their company. The project's sponsor will leave at the end of the fiscal year, and it seems likely that one of the project's current stakeholders will become the new project sponsor. Of the possible stakeholders, the project manager thinks that Mark would be the best project sponsor for the project. Mark has always supported the project, maintaining a high engagement with the project manager and project team. Mark also has significant power over project decisions. Mark supports the project by leading bi-weekly review sessions with the project team to ensure that any blockers they encounter are addressed and eliminated. Because Mark understands the project profoundly and believes in its mission, the project manager considers these meetings essential for the project's success. On the other hand, the project manager is worried about Steve, another stakeholder with the potential to become the project's sponsor. Steve considers the bi-weekly review sessions a waste of time, and the project manager strongly suspects that he will move to block them if he becomes the project's sponsor. Before the current sponsor leaves, the project manager decides to update ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. Following the update, the bi-weekly review sessions will be required rather than optional. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Correct answer
Politics and power structures
Characteristics of stakeholders
Analytical and assessment techniques
Requirements management
Overall explanation
For inherently social or organization-wide situations rather than personal, the expert judgment of politics and power structures should inform ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. Organizations change and requirements are a safeguard to ensure that their progress can continue autonomously. Analytical and assessment techniques can be used to create ground rules but are most often used to identify problems rather than solve them. Requirements management should be included in ground rules, but ideally, this will comprise a process rather than an ad hoc solution. Stakeholder characteristics may need to be reflected in the project charter when describing stakeholder engagement. However, they are by and large responses to the needs of specific stakeholders or groups of stakeholders rather than the organization at large.

You are the project manager of a software development project. Your team has nine team members and they feel like the project cannot get traction. You learn that the project is getting a record number of change requests. The development team is beginning to feel fatigued by continually changing course. What likely went wrong?
The project manager lacks the authority to manage the project successfully.
Correct answer
Stakeholders were not identified or engaged in the planning stages.
The developers do not possess the skills required to execute the project.
There is a problem in the integrated change control process.
Overall explanation
While all these choices are plausible, more than likely, some stakeholders were not identified or engaged in project planning stages. If stakeholders had been committed early on, there would have been a well-defined scope, and the team would not be receiving as many change requests. Change requests are very rarely due to a problem with developers' skills. Change requests are typically a result of incomplete scope or functionality that needs to be corrected. While there may be a problem within the integrated change control process, the volume of change requests is not tied to the process of managing change itself. The project manager's authority does not correlate to the volume of change requests for the project scope.

You are the project manager of an IT implementation project for your organization. This project has replaced all of the servers in your company and 750 workstations with new laptops. Throughout the project, there have been risks that have become issues. For example, when migrating the data to a new server, a hard disk failure caused a delay for the backup and restoration of data which affected the workforce accessing their data after your weekend installation. Today, your project sponsor has asked that you send him a list of secondary risks for your project. What will you send him?
A list of warning signs of a risk's occurrence.
Correct answer
A list of risks created by the implementation of enacted risk responses.
A list of actions performed if the initial risk responses do not work.
A list of risks that remain after the team has planned risk responses.
Overall explanation
Secondary risks are risks created by implementing enacted risk responses; this should be sent to the project sponsor. A list of warning signs of a risk's occurrence is a risk trigger. An action that will be performed if the initial risk response does not work is a fallback plan. A risk that remains after a team has planned risk responses is a residual risk.

Samantha is a project manager with the global Help-a-Pet non-profit organization and will be working with international experts on her project to enhance domestic pets' prognosis with rare illnesses. What will Samantha rely on the most to guide her development of a code of conduct document for her project?
Correct answer
Organizational Process Assets
A local animal hospital specializing in rare illnesses
Enterprise Environmental Factors
A local Humane Society
Overall explanation
Since Samantha's organization is sponsoring the project, the project will need to align its code of conduct with the organization's code of conduct standards, which is an organizational process asset (OPA). The OPA will be the primary source of information, but additional tailoring can be achieved to customize the conduct to meet the project's requirements. The enterprise environmental factors are the external forces on the project. The local Humane Society would not be helpful as they will not have the necessary information regarding the Help-a-Pet non-profit organization's project management assets or knowledge.

After a recent sprint review, one stakeholder became agitated at the progress Project IQ is making. After reviewing prior experiences with the project, Xavier determines that the stakeholder consistently attends sprint review meetings but cannot convince the product owner to add several items to the product backlog. What should Xavier do next?
Assign a team member to update the stakeholder.
Invite the stakeholder to all project meetings.
Correct answer
Keep this stakeholder informed on progress.
Do nothing. The product owner will help them.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to keep the stakeholder informed on the project's progress. The stakeholder may have an issue with the product owner's refusal to add items to the product backlog, and they are frustrated with the project not including their features. Inviting the stakeholder to more meetings is not ideal given the stakeholder's power and influence in the project. Assigning a team member to update the stakeholder is not ideal given their power and influence. Doing nothing risks further agitating this stakeholder.

Monique is the project manager for the Fuel Pump Project. A piece of equipment was recently purchased for $10,000 and is expected to last throughout the five-year project schedule. After five years, the equipment is expected to be worth $1,000. What is the amount that can be annually written off using straight-line depreciation?
$1,000
Correct answer
$1,800
Zero
$2,000
Overall explanation
The correct response is that $1,800 can be written off each year. Straight-line depreciation takes the item's purchase value, minus the salvage price, divided by the number of time periods. For this example, you would subtract $1,000 (the salvage price) from $10,000 (the purchase value) to get $9,000. Divide $9,000 by five years to get $1,800 per year. $1,000 is incorrect because it does not reflect the calculation correctly. $2,000 is incorrect because it is not the answer calculated by correctly using the straight-line depreciation formula. Zero is incorrect because it does not reflect the correct calculation.

Each aspect of a virtual team member, no matter the circumstance, needs to focus on communication and meeting project objectives. Ensuring access to meetings, using hardware, and stating all clear expectations when working remotely can create a win-win for all involved. Remote users will need access to local resources and the technology to enable remote work. Remote users will need access to email, audio and video conferencing, and web-based meeting accessibility.

The correct answer is progressive elaboration. Progressive elaboration happens when the team learns further project details over time. Requirements gathering is the elicitation of requirements from stakeholders to build the product and project scope. Requirements scoping, however, is not a valid project management term. Coupled vision is not a valid project management term. Progressive management is not a valid project management term, so this choice is incorrect.

After reviewing the applicants' pool, the project sponsor would like to hire an African American candidate qualified for the position. There is no diversity on the team, and the project sponsor would like to change this going forward. Why do you think diversity is so important to the project sponsor?
Correct answer
The project sponsor wants to ensure that the team consists of members with different backgrounds and experiences to learn from each other's skillsets.
The project sponsor has taken diversity training and knows how important diversity is to improve organizational maturity.
The project sponsor wants to avoid any legal ramifications from human resources by not selecting the most qualified candidate.

The correct answer is variable costs. This scenario is an example of variable costs, defined as costs that can be affected by certain circumstances within the project. Parametric costs would describe the same costs regardless of how many workbooks were printed; this is an incorrect response. This scenario does not describe an indirect cost, which is a cost that is shared among several projects. Fixed costs are costs that do not vary; the cost of the workbooks varies; therefore, this is an incorrect response.

This is a clear example of a Kanban project. The workflow presented describes a Kanban board in which work items are pulled into various statuses by the people doing the work. Scrum projects can use a Kanban board for the sprint backlog, but the scrum methodology is different from the pure Kanban methodology described in this scenario.

By chance, Tina discovers that Doreen is currently applying for new jobs that focus on project management. What is the appropriate conflict resolution?
Collaborate/problem solve
Force/direct
Correct answer
Compromise/reconcile
Smooth/accommodate
Overall explanation
Comprise or reconciliation is a good choice when one person can exchange something in return for something more valuable to a project. For instance, if a high-performing resource can continue to work at half capacity while learning a new skill, this may be a worthwhile exchange. Collaboration or problem solving is ideal, but only if the team members have viewpoints that are not mutually exclusive. Forcing or directing is only appropriate if team members refuse to compromise and the project is running out of time or money. Smoothing or accommodating would be appropriate if team members saw eye to eye on at least one issue but requires avoidance of disagreements.

Centralized contracting
Correct answer
Decentralized contracting
Intentional contracting

Overall explanation
Often in smaller businesses, the project manager takes on the responsibility of purchasing authority. This is mainly due to the organization not having a formal purchasing department. Centralized purchasing is the opposite of this answer. All contracting duties flow through a centralized procurement or purchasing office.

Project constraint
Project boundary
Stakeholder expectation
Project assumption
Overall explanation
The correct answer is project constraint. A constraint is a limitation in the project in this case, it is time and budget. Other examples of restraint could be in quality, scheduling, resources, or technology. Stakeholder expectation is not the best choice, as this is a documented requirement. Cost and schedule are always constraints in a project. Project assumptions are things believed to be true, but have not been proven to be true, such as the weather or technical compatibility.

Correct answer
Ensure all project contracts are closed out.
Overall explanation
Thomas should review all project contracts to ensure they have been properly closed out and met their terms. Closing out all the procurement requirements is part of the project closure and needs to be done to ensure that the organization and the contracted work are in agreement that the work is completed, approved, and paid. Thomas should not release the project team until he ensures everything else is resolved. The project tasks have been completed, so there likely is not a backlog of requirements to complete.

They see a lack of coordination, duplication of efforts, and inconsistency. What can Bill do to improve his team's situation?
Make phone calls to individual team members.
Allow each location to work independently.
Correct answer
Schedule a video conference or conference call frequently for the entire team.
Create daily email digests to instruct the team.
Overall explanation
Bill needs to get everyone on the same page. Since meeting in a conference room is not an option, frequent video conferences or conference calls are the next best option. While emails are useful, they are not always the best way of communicating. A conference call or video conference with all or most of the team attending allows issues to be addressed that are harder to tackle one by one or via email. The challenge for Bill would be navigating the time zones to make this possible, but it is the best option to push his team and the project forward. Allowing each location to work independently is not feasible as project teams need to work together and rely upon each other. Daily email digests to instruct the team is not an effective method to lead or build the project team. Make phone calls to individual team members can be useful, but this segments the communication among the team members. Not everyone will receive the same message and this is not a good use of the project manager's time.

Overall explanation
Sharing the approved project plan with Don and the project team and answering any questions they may have regarding the project is the best leadership approach. It is better to confront the problem and field any questions Don and the team may have. The project manager should work with Don to confront the problem and field any questions rather than to solely discuss the problem with the project sponsor. Although the project sponsor can be involved in answering Don's questions, only discussing the issue with the project sponsor offers no resolution for Don and the project team.

Jessica is the project manager for a project which has just officially begun and is scheduled to last fifteen weeks. The project has a budget of $100,000. Jessica would like to start planning a project schedule but is unsure if she has everything she needs. What is the project document displayed below, and does it help Jessica?




It is a milestone list, and it will let her build the schedule.
It is a list of project team members and will help her build a schedule.
It is a stakeholder register and will not help her with the schedule.
Correct answer
It is a list of activities and will help her build the schedule.
Overall explanation
This is a list of activities, which will help Jessica begin planning a schedule. Without knowing what activities are needed, Jessica will be unable to acquire the right team. A milestone list would be an output of designing a schedule. A stakeholder register is used to track a project's stakeholders. The document displayed is not a list of project team members.

Kristin is the project manager for a software project. She comes from a cybersecurity background, so she is eager to leverage her knowledge to make her product safe for her clients and her company. She reviews the standard compliance requirement matrix for the software she creates and uses it to create a cybersecurity checklist for the project. How is project compliance being managed?
Compliance audit
Compliance risk
Correct answer
Compliance documentation
Compliance council
Overall explanation
Compliance documentation is the written overview of the various compliance requirements a project must meet. A compliance council is a group of compliance specialists that discusses compliance issues for a given project. Compliance risk is the risk associated with not being compliant, for instance, with security needs. A compliance audit is run to determine if a project is compliant by its own or external standards.

A company's internal project to develop a new baggage scanning system at a domestic airport has just been completed. The management team is excited about the latest development and requires you to train all airport staff on its operations. You have been assigned a team of instructional designers, trainers, and subject matter experts on the baggage scanning system. What should you do next?
Consult with end-users about their perceptions of the new system.
Secure all baggage handling operations until the employees are trained on the new system.
Determine any bugs or glitches the baggage handling system may have.
Correct answer
Identify the impact on the current state of operations at the airport regarding baggage handling.
Overall explanation
You will need to identify what adjustments the staff will have to run for handling the new system effectively. By understanding how the end-users will work with the new system and their work requirements, you will be better prepared to create an effective set of requirements for the training project. Securing all baggage handling operations may not be practical as flights will still be occurring within the airport. Consulting with end-users about their perceptions of the new system seems nice, but the system is being implemented regardless of what the end-users think. You might complete this action if there are rumors and negative perceptions about the system, but this likely will not be your next step in the project. Determining any bugs or glitches the baggage handling system may have will not be readily available until some time after the new system is in place.

Zander has just informed his project team that each member will contribute to the lessons learned register. Not understanding this approach, Zander's team wants to know what the documentation will be used for and the purpose. Of the responses below, which best describes the purpose of the lessons learned register?
When a project is done, It gives input to team member evaluations.
Reported by the project team, it provides evidence of the project's progress.
Correct answer
It gives historical data for current and future projects.
It provides proof of concept for management.
Overall explanation
The correct response is that the lessons learned register provides historical information for current and future projects. Giving input to team member evaluations at the end of a project is incorrect because evaluations should be done throughout the project. While a lessons learned register can provide evidence of a project's progression, it is not its purpose. Providing proof of concept is incorrect because it typically is done early in the project planning process.

Integrated change control is the correct response. It is a process that documents project changes and variances, the impact of changes and variances, a response to the changes, and offers corrective action. The change control system is a documented procedure used to manage change requests and is part of integrated change control. Scope change control is incorrect because it is defined as the process of managing changes that only affect work in the project scope.

Which of the following components, dependencies, or logical relationships best describes the scenario above?
Correct answer
Finish-to-start (FS)
Start-to-finish (SF)
Finish-to-finish (FF)
Start-to-start (SS)
Overall explanation
The correct answer for this scenario is finish-to-start (FS) because the completion of pouring the concrete foundation is dependent on the commencement of heating for the area. This means that heating needs to start before or at the same time the concrete pouring finishes, ensuring the concrete sets properly under the required conditions.

1C Enterprises has expanded its offices on a global scale. With the global expansion, you now have project team members in five additional countries. Each of the countries that the organization has an office in has varied cultural diversities. Management has asked you, a project manager, to create some rules and policies to consider the differences when unifying team members for all projects in the organization. In a project, when the project manager is considering remote workers with different backgrounds and cultures, what should the project manager do?
Correct answer
Create an effective resource management plan
Build a strong project management team
Spend more time in team development even if the resources are all located in one facility
Control resources more strictly than if the resources were collocated
Overall explanation
While the development team, management team, and controlling resources are all a part of the project resource management, plan resource management is the process that defines how to estimate, acquire, manage and utilize physical and team resources. The plan resource management process would allow you to delineate each consideration for cultural diversity and ensure that team members can work with each other's schedules, time zones and be considerate of various cultural holidays. Building a strong project management team is ideal for any project manager, but this choice does not address the resource management concerns. Controlling resources more strictly than if the resources were collocated is not the best choice as there is little evidence that you will need to control resources more strictly just because they are remote. Remote workers, or virtual teams, are a common project management concept and would require a different management approach than a more strict management approach. There is little reason to spend more time on team development in this scenario. Team development strategies will be different for virtual teams than collocated teams.

Jeffrey is the scrum master for a project which is just finishing its second iteration. During the first iteration, the project team noted that several deliverables required rework after they were deployed. This has cost the project team time to solve, but they have not yet found the problem's source. What should Jeffrey do next?
Correct answer
Build time into the next iteration to identify the source of the problem.
Consult with the project's product owner about solutions.
Cancel the next iteration and have the team focus on finding the problem.
Do nothing. The project team will figure it out as they go.
Overall explanation
Jeffrey should schedule a time for the team to determine why the deliverables' quality is so low. Despite taking time now, it will help reduce the amount of rework required. Canceling the iteration will prevent any progress on the project. The product owner is not likely to know the source of poor quality. Doing nothing runs the risk of continuing poor quality and damage to the team's reputation.

Project manager review process
Overall explanation
Integrated change control involved reviewing the change request, approval, and managing the outcomes to other processes and documents and the various management plans. It also accounts for the changing conditions within enterprise environmental factors and organization process assets. The project manager review process is not a valid process. One output of the control quality process is change requests to submit to the change review board. Risk assurance is not a valid project management term.

Ji Yeung has a problem with one of her direct reports, Jules, refuses to share stakeholder contact information and meeting invitations with Tom, a talented business analyst and a new addition to Ji Yeung's team. When Ji Yeung talks to Tom, he is combative and later uses a group messaging application to tell the team that Jules needs to share her contacts and stop gatekeeping. Tom and Jules are no longer on speaking terms. When Ji Yeung talks to Jules, she shuts the conversation down by asserting that Tom will muddy the waters if he speaks with stakeholders. When Ji Yeung explains how important it is for Tom to be in touch with the stakeholders, Jules balks and threatens to leave if Tom establishes regular contact with the stakeholders. There is a major release on the horizon, leading to increased stakeholder communication. The stakeholders have told Ji Yeung that they are concerned by Jules' lack of responsiveness. Several business days pass before Jules responds to their communications, and Jules misses crucial details when reporting out to Ji Yeung's team at large. The stakeholders make it clear that they cannot work with Ji Yeung's organization if this continues. What is the appropriate conflict resolution?
Compromise/reconcile
Correct answer
Force/direct
Smooth/accommodate
Collaborate/problem solve
Overall explanation
Forcing is appropriate given the tight timeline and the risk to the project. A quick decision may result in losing a resource. Still, if the status quo is unacceptable and team members appear unable or unwilling to compromise, this may be the only option. Collaboration or problem solving is ideal, but only if the team members have viewpoints that are not mutually exclusive. Compromise or reconciliation might make sense if team members thought the issues were more important than their roles, but both seem ready to take drastic measures if their positions are challenged. Smoothing or accommodating would be appropriate if team members saw eye to eye on at least one issue but would require avoidance of disagreements.

In theory, it allows the company to make all its deliveries the day after a purchase is made. The other colleague prefers to use a tried and tested delivery company, which may not fulfill orders as quickly as the smaller contractors but is less risky. The colleagues accuse each other of being out of touch, and they have stopped responding to a group email thread, preferring instead to communicate with Ari independently. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by
Correct answer
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Encouraging collaborative problem-solving
Creating team-building opportunities
Using open and effective communication
Overall explanation
In addition to resolving issues, mentors who can help their employees constructively manage conflicts may find a greater solution than the sum of its parts. For instance, it may make sense to ship a cheaper, perishable product using a quick, relatively risky method, while a more expensive durable product can be shipped in a slower, less risky way. Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance, but this is more crucial at the early stages of team development. Collaborative problem-solving means the parties all work together to solve a problem, which is what should happen between the coworkers. Sometimes, when tempers flare it is difficult for the project team members to step back, and then come together in a spirit of cooperation to tackle the problem. Open and effective communication is paramount in good projects, but this question is about managing conflicts in a constructive manner between the two team members.

Given your extensive experience in your organization's project environment as a project manager, your expertise is called on to consult with developing a new change control board at an aerospace company. You know that projects in the organization have consistently been over budget, which has caused stress for management, stakeholders, and the project manager. You suspect that the initial project budgets have been set too low and that contingency reserves are lacking. You believe that a change control board is needed to review all change requests associated with projects that their project management office will be executing. What is the most appropriate selection of board members to include when reviewing who should be selected to be on the change control board?
Senior project managers
Correct answer
Customers, project managers, project team members
Subject matter experts and management
The finance department and stakeholders
Overall explanation
In addition to the project management teams' expert judgment, stakeholders may be involved for their expertise. Consultants and additional subject matter experts who serve positions on the change control board are selected based on complexity and the organization's risk tolerance. A change control board should consist of other individuals or groups besides the financial department and project stakeholders. Subject matter experts and management may have knowledge of project domain activity. However, they may not understand the project from the customer's point of view and the project manager's insight.

Jim is a project manager for Project T, which has just begun project planning and is intended to last twelve iterations. While speaking with his project team, Jim discovers that the team may deploy an early release to allow the firm to realize partial benefits while the rest of the project is completed. What should Jim do next?
Correct answer
Commend the team on their idea and recommend it to the product owner.
Tell the team that they should complete the entire project before releasing anything.
Have the team present their idea at the next daily stand-up.
Redefine Project T only to deploy the early release and schedule a follow-up project to handle the rest.
Overall explanation
While this is a great idea, the product owner should be informed and decide whether to proceed with it. While the project should be fully completed, it may not be necessary to wait until it is done before realizing its benefits. Changing the scope of Project T only to include the early release is not an ideal solution. Generally, only the project team is present at the daily stand-up, so presenting this idea will have no benefit.

Stu is managing a long-term project that has a year until completion. This is not an agile project, and the project sponsor and key stakeholders want the project to have a “big reveal” or “grand opening” feel to it. Stu’s project utilizes many resources and man-hours, but the cost to benefit ratio appears to be very favorable to the company. If all goes to plan, this project will propel the company forward, and the benefits will be very apparent. In the meantime, though, the company stock price is stagnant. There have recently been layoffs, and for many stakeholders, Stu’s project feels like an indulgence. They cannot see the benefits, do not know many of the details, and some are calling for Stu’s dismissal. Stu thankfully has the backing of senior management, who have seen preliminary results and are enthused. How should Stu address the enthusiasm gap with his other stakeholders?
Seek out the most vocal stakeholders and work with them.
Just wait and endure the criticism.
Fast-track the project, so everyone sees how great it is.
Correct answer
Communicate the high-level objectives of the project to stakeholders.
Overall explanation
Stu should find a way to communicate with all shareholders. He does not need to share every detail of the project, but he can get in front of them and let them know their frustrations are heard. Stu can seek senior management's blessing about what to share, and by merely communicating, the stakeholders may feel differently about the project. Waiting and enduring will cause the tension to build and could eventually disrupt the project. Fast-tracking would be an unnecessary use of resources to deal with a communication problem. Seeking out vocal stakeholders might put out some fires, but this is a systematic communication issue. Stu needs to let all stakeholders know that they have value and that they are heard.

One of the many projects you are managing is experiencing multiple quality failures, and the stakeholders are frustrated with you, the project team, and the work the project has completed. The repeated issues have caused your project to miss key milestones and are affecting the business value the project aims to deliver. You know that changes need to be made immediately to avoid the risk of your project's termination. What should be your first step in addressing this situation?
Call the project sponsor due to the severity of missing multiple milestones.
Suggest terminating the project due to the dissatisfaction of the stakeholders.
Execute the most promising change right away and keep the stakeholders informed.
Correct answer
Meet with the project stakeholders to discuss the issues in the project.
Overall explanation
The first action is to engage with the stakeholders to discuss the issues in the project. This will acknowledge the project issues so that you and the team can create a modified plan to ascertain expectations. This also allows the stakeholders an opportunity to air their grievances about the project and what needs to be done to gain their support again for the project. A project manager should not contact the project sponsor without first collecting more information from the affected stakeholders. It is okay to go to the project sponsor with a problem, but you should also present a solution to the problem. Never drop off a project's problem for the sponsor to solve. The project manager should aim to recover the project, not suggest that the project be terminated due to stakeholder dissatisfaction. While delivering on the most promising change seems like a good idea, it is best first to engage the stakeholders and confront the problem. Next, you should submit any changes through a change control process.

Emma solicited feedback to identify the causes of failure and outlined future tasks that could lead to improved results. She works with the team through risk identification and creating possible risk responses. She documented the feedback, added her insight as a project manager, and created communication that she circulated to several stakeholders.

The project charter was not updated.
Findings were not communicated.
Risk analysis was not completed.
Correct answer
Tasks designed to prevent failure were not assigned.
Overall explanation
Investigation without action will not prevent future failures. After identifying the causes of project failure, preventive actions need to be assigned and owned by team members to be effective. The risk analysis was initiated, but even if it had been completed, the risks could not be mitigated without team members taking accountability for their preventive tasks.

One of the disapproving stakeholders called a member of Kelly's team to complain. The team now wants Kelly to explain how a change could be approved with such an influential stakeholder not supporting the change. How does Kelly explain the approval process?
Correct answer
The key stakeholders voted, and it was a majority decision to approve the change.
The CEO said the change was approved.
The key stakeholders voted, and it was a decision reach by plurality.
The key stakeholders voted, and it was a unanimous decision to approve the change.
Overall explanation
The key stakeholders voted, and it was a majority decision to approve the change. A majority decision is reached when more than 50 percent of the members of the group agree. A unanimous decision requires that everyone agree. Plurality is where the largest block in a group decides. However, since we know the amount had 90 percent approval, the best answer is that a majority decision was made. The CEO is not the deciding factor, but the majority decision is the deciding factor regardless of who voted for or against the change. This was not a unanimous decision but a majority decision. Plurality is where the largest block in a group decides, and it is usually when there are multiple choices, such as tile, wood, or carpet – 40% could vote for tile, 35% for wood, and 25% could vote for carpet.

During an initial planning meeting with stakeholders, it is noted that a significant benefit of the project will not be realized until the thirteenth month of work. The stakeholders ask Abigail if it is possible to realize this benefit sooner. What is the best response in this scenario?
Correct answer
It may be possible to realize benefits sooner by analyzing and arranging the schedule accordingly.
Fast-tracking will help the project realize benefits sooner.
Crashing the project schedule will result in realizing the benefits sooner.
It is not possible given specific dependencies.
Overall explanation
Without more information, Abigail cannot know for certain if this is possible. By examining the project plan, specifically the task list and schedules, she may arrange things so that benefits are felt incrementally and sooner rather than all at once. Crashing the schedule by increasing resources may not be possible and will certainly increase costs to the project. Without further information, Abigail will not know if this is possible.

Escalate the issue to the team members' functional managers.
Correct answer
Remind the team that retrospectives are about improving, not assigning blame.
Do nothing; the project team is responsible for the retrospective.
Reprimand both team members.
Overall explanation
Retrospectives are intended to allow the team to learn from the past and not intended to assign blame. Because the team is new to agile, they may not fully understand the point of the retrospective. Samantha should return the focus of the discussion to improvements and guide the team members back to the meeting's purpose. Reprimanding the team members will not help refocus the retrospective. The scrum master should guide the team back to the purpose of the retrospective. Escalating the issue to their managers will also not help as they will still be placing blame. Samantha needs to guide the team members back to the purpose of the meeting. Doing nothing risks the discussion escalating.

Martha has a highly complex issue on her project and is planning to host a workshop. It is important that the team reach a consensus on the approach. The best thing for Martha to do is
Correct answer
Use a collaboration game.
To ask the higher-level managers to approve the approach that wins the most votes and convey that to their direct reports.
Pick the two solutions with the most votes and allow 15 minutes for the person who proposed each to summarize why theirs is best.
Do a silent vote on the proposed solutions.
Overall explanation
The best approach to reaching consensus is to use a collaboration game, as it will most likely bring the group to a consensus. A silent vote only makes each person’s opinion private. This solution does not necessarily lead to consensus. Allow two people to speak does not get the group to agree on one decision, and this solution does not necessarily lead to consensus. Getting management approval has no effect on the team, and this solution does not necessarily lead to consensus.

Mike is a project manager who is a very skilled negotiator. He has honed his skills over several years and after making a few mistakes along the way. He started by negotiating too softly and always giving in. Then he overcorrected by negotiating too hard. Later in his career, he settled into a principled negotiation approach. Which one of the following statements best describes Mike's approach to contract negotiation?
Get the best deal for the organization.
Correct answer
Aim for fair and equitable agreements.
Never reveal your actual number.
Only negotiate from a position of strength or advantage.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to aim for a fair and equitable agreement for both parties. This means that the vendor and Mike's organization agree to what is being purchased and the price point that will be paid to the vendor. A good deal is when both people feel like they have won and are happy. Never revealing your actual number may be good negotiating advice for some, but it is not the best choice presented. Sometimes you will need to reveal your budget to determine what you can afford from the vendor. You cannot always negotiate from a position of strength. For example, consider a small organization negotiating a sale to a large enterprise. The small organization cannot necessarily negotiate from strength in that scenario. Getting the best deal for the organization seems like a good choice, but it does not consider what is fair for the products or services the vendor is providing. The best choice is fair and equitable contract negotiations.

Recently, a stakeholder approached her about an important detail for the project, which Sally emails to the development team. Sally is concerned that the team may have questions or need follow-up on this item. What should Sally do next?
Send a second email asking if everyone understood everything.
Do nothing. She has forwarded the request appropriately.
Correct answer
Walk over to the development team and ask them what questions they have.
Refer the team to the stakeholder for follow-up information.
Overall explanation
Walk over to the development team and ask them what questions they have. Connecting directly and personally with the development team will help Sally confirm the team understands the update and solicit feedback. Doing nothing risks the development team misunderstanding the request. Sending the development team to the stakeholder is non-ideal as they may be unavailable.

A fellow project manager is retiring and handing off his projects to you to carry forward. Before leaving for an eight-month trip on a cruise ship, he mentions that his projects are on schedule but only because he challenged his team and pushed them relentlessly. You know that overworking the project team and pushing people relentlessly is not a best practice, but you also know that the team needs to carry out activities to meet project objectives. What would you do next in this scenario?
Work with the team to control scope.
Work with the team to control quality.
Correct answer
Work with the team to direct and manage project work.
Monitor and control project work.
Overall explanation
Directing and managing project work is the correct answer. Performing actions to accomplish project activities is one of the direct and manage project work process goals. It is not necessary to continue to push the team relentlessly to get things done. Control scope monitors project status and manages changes to the scope baseline. Control quality monitors and records the result of the quality management activities. Monitoring and controlling project work tracks, reviews, and reports overall project progress.

Sharon, a project manager, is investigating the deliverable process in her project and would like to determine the output quality. She is concerned that the timeframe when a deliverable is done and ready to be released to when stakeholders use the deliverable is taking too long. The team is under pressure to complete the work, but the completed work is not being used for days or weeks. Sharon needs to evaluate how to alleviate the stress from the rush mentality being forced on the project team. Which tool will best serve Sharon to identify whether the process is under control or not?
Pareto chart
Correct answer
Control chart
Ishikawa diagram
Run chart
Overall explanation
A control chart is an ideal tool because it allows Sharon to evaluate the process's quality performance by comparing the date against the upper/lower specification and control limits. She can use the control chart to measure the process of releasing a deliverable and the time from release to utilization. An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone diagram or a cause-and-effect diagram, is used to identify the root cause of any problems. A run chart records activity without an upper or lower control limit. A Pareto chart is a bar chart to identify the categories of defects within the project.

They can easily run out of the slips of paper used in silent voting.
The label ‘must have’ is placed on nearly every item.
Correct answer
Nearly all items are labeled as a top priority.
The difficulty in prioritizing each item in incremental order.
Overall explanation
The difficulty in using a scheme where you can simply choose priority 1, priority 2, etc. is that most items tend to be labeled as a top priority when they are not. The label ‘must have’ is affiliated with the MoSCoW method. There is no silent voting with a simple scheme. There is no requirement for incremental ordering.

Correct answer
An offer and consideration

Start date and acceptance of the start date
Overall explanation
An offer and consideration is the best and correct response here. All contracts include an offer and a consideration. This response is incorrect because even though the project's start date may be specified, the acceptance of the start date is vague and unnecessary for all contracts. The value and worth of the procured product or service may not be explicitly defined in the contract; therefore, this response is incorrect.

Aubry should ensure the team gets to know each other and understand what everyone does on the project. The project ground rules have likely already been established – or soon should be – but the team needs to be introduced to one another as this is their first planning meeting collectively as an entire team.

Correct answer
Present the change to the CCB

The best and correct response is that Sherry's following action should be to present the change to the CCB (change control board). Management notification is a tempting choice, but it is incorrect for two reasons a project manager should never contact management with an issue; there is no suggested solution to the problem. A feasibility study is incorrect because it is not appropriate for the conditions surrounding the change.

You are working on a project to develop a new smart television with better streaming capabilities. During your latest retrospective, you find out from the product owner that potential end-users want increased voice-recognition security. You decide to log this in your product backlog as a priority user story to complete during the next sprint. Which of the following quality management approaches best describes the scenario above?
Management responsibility
Mutually beneficial partnership with suppliers
Continual improvement
Correct answer
Customer satisfaction
Overall explanation
This scenario is best described as customer satisfaction. This process involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer expectations. This process requires a combination of conformance to requirements and fitness for use. In agile environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the project. Management responsibility is not a valid answer for the scenario. Continual improvement is not a valid choice. While continual improvement is tempting, the goal is to add a feature that the customer values and add business value to the project's end result. A mutually beneficial partnership with suppliers is not the best choice. The business value is that customers will receive the security they are looking for in the technology.

You are the scrum master for the RGD Project. The RGD project will create new software that will allow employees to schedule time off, submit time cards, review how many sick and vacation days they have available, and view and update additional aspects related to human resources. The project has been going well. The team has completed four sprints, with each sprint lasting four weeks. The product backlog has 459 user story points remaining, and the team velocity for user story points is 36. In the current sprint planning session, the product owner shared a new requirement that has been moved to the top of the product backlog. The requirement is sized at 12 user story points. Based on this information, how long will the project last?





It is impossible to tell based on this information.
Correct answer
One year
13 weeks
36 weeks
Overall explanation
The project will last just over 52 weeks. This is determined by taking the total number of story points, which is 471, divided by the velocity, which is 36, for a result of 13 sprints. Each sprint lasts four weeks; with 13 sprints at four weeks each, the result will be 52 weeks or one year. The choice of 13 weeks is incorrect; there are 13 sprints, not weeks, remaining in the project. The choice of 36 weeks is not a valid calculation. There are 36 user story points per iteration completed, as this is the velocity. It is possible to calculate the project duration based on current conditions and information.

Edith is a scrum master for a software development project to create a new phone application. During a recent iteration, the team lost a significant amount of work due to a server failure. The server was not configured for redundancy and it is an embarrassing issue for the project team and Edith. The project team believes they can recover the lost time by the end of the next sprint, and they are willing to work some weekend days to recoup the time. What should Edith do next?
Do nothing. The project will eventually get back on track.
Correct answer
Immediately inform the project stakeholders about the incident and the recovery plan.
Wait until the next sprint review to inform the stakeholders about the incident.
Use the contingency reserve to hire a part-time consultant to make up for the lost work.
Overall explanation
Given the impact of this incident, Edith should inform the stakeholders as soon as she is able. This will help build trust and keep her stakeholders aware of what is going on in their project. Doing nothing risks the stakeholders finding out on their own, damaging Edith's relationship with them. Waiting until the next sprint review is not a good option as the stakeholders will be finding out about the incident well after it happened. A contingency reserve is used for known risks and this is an issue as the unknown risk has occurred. Agile projects typically do not do the exhaustive risk identification and analysis that predictive projects do.

As a highly motivated project manager, you have dedicated many hours to developing your stakeholder engagement plan and identified the key stakeholder and their influence and power on your project. How would you engage with a strong influence and high-impact stakeholder group?
Develop a separate communication plan and include details that other stakeholders cannot access.
Engage as you would with any other stakeholder since the project management plan is approved and baselined, and no one can influence it without going through the change control board.
Correct answer
Proactively engage with them by including them in discussions and involving them in decision-making activities.
Ensure the stakeholder register identifies their power and influence, so they are updated first.
Overall explanation
Proactive engagement deals with different communication levels. You must seek feedback and involve your desired stakeholders in your discussions and decisions, which will increase the project's overall success rate. Stakeholder registers may guide you on your top influencers, but they will not improve your engagement strategy. Creating separate communication streams is not feasible in most cases and may not provide the level of engagement necessary to influence change. Stakeholders can influence a baselined project plan.

Mario oversees five projects that are managed through the organization's project management office. These projects range from several low-budget projects to complex solutions requiring extensive product roadmaps to manage their development. What is the recommended project management approach in such environments?
An adaptive life cycle may need to be adopted.
Rolling wave planning must be adopted.
A project management office is not needed to organize a wide range of projects.
Correct answer
A predictive, adaptive, or hybrid life cycle may prove most beneficial.
Overall explanation
The project management methodology is tailored by the project manager, who can assess the complexity of the project environment to tailor a project management methodology to optimize project efficiency. A project management office guides a project manager on the organization's best project management practices. An adaptive life cycle is where a detailed scope is not defined and approved before the project begins. In complex projects, a product roadmap and detailed planning are needed.

When they started the project, they often worked at each others' desks to maximize real-time feedback and capture creative and functional ideas. However, the project manager recently moved and has been fully remote ever since. As they attempt to finalize the visual design, the project manager has sent many emails to the User Experience Engineer to describe how the project should look. Unfortunately, the User Experience Engineer replies to these emails with mock-ups that do not quite capture the project manager's needs. Which alternative should the project managers explore for virtual team member engagement?
A shared portal
Correct answer
Video conferencing
Email/chat
Audio conferencing
Overall explanation
Video conferencing is a critical technique for virtual teams. It is especially helpful for demonstrating visual components or making contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. But such repositories are mainly useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update many people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members. Email and chat are not always appropriate for long-form communications. Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication. Audio conferences are more appropriate for sharing nuances that are not necessarily included in written communication.

Technical debt
Run-away defects
Correct answer
Escaped defects
Failure mode
Overall explanation
Escaped defects are defects that make it all the way through checkpoints to production. Because its remediation requires a large amount of work to be redone, multiple tests and retests, and the discovery of dependent code, it is the costliest type of defect.

All project teams in your organization are required to write their charter and share it among the project's stakeholders. Martha's colleague asks what the process is for altering a team charter. What will you tell her?
No one can alter the team charter once the charter has been approved.
Correct answer
The team charter is a working document that the entire project team owns and can alter at any point in time.
Altering the team charter requires an approved change request in the integrated change control process.
No team member can alter the team charter once the project has begun.
Overall explanation
The team charter should be owned and maintained by the entire team and can be altered at any point. Making a change to the team charter does not require a change request in the integrated change control process. The integrated change control process is typically used for adjusting project management plans that include baselines such as the time, cost, and scope baselines. No one can alter the team charter once the charter has been approved is incorrect; changes to the charter can be made by the project team.

She is very interested in the company's commitment to the environment and social justice. While Cheryl is passionate, sometimes her passion gets in the way of project progress. For example, Cheryl may start an argument with someone who does not agree with her ideas and has disdain for people she views as lukewarm. A Myers-Briggs test confirms that she is a healer-type. What is likely to motivate Cheryl the most?
A raise
Complicated projects
A promotion
Correct answer
Placement in company committees
Overall explanation
While most employees enjoy promotions, raises, and challenging work, Cheryl is already achieving this naturally as a valued member of her team. Cheryl would be very gratified by involvement in company committees that cover commitment to the environment, social justice, and general relationships with the world and community. If these things do not currently exist, sponsorship of such activities or committees would be an incentive. As a healer-type personality, the promotions are not what Cheryl is interested in, so this is not the best choice.

Email a copy of the project plan to the stakeholder.
Tell the stakeholder that an agile methodology does not use project plans.
Ask a team member to update the stakeholder every Friday.

This stakeholder is likely to be more familiar with a predictive lifecycle than with the agile concepts of backlogs, iterations, etc. Educating the stakeholder on the differences between predictive and adaptive lifecycles will help him understand agile flexibility. Agile does not have a project plan the way predictive project does, so there may be nothing to email. Telling the stakeholder that there is no project plan is accurate as the project roadmap could be considered a high-level strategy.

Clint is frustrated by this as none of the project is being funded by taxpayer dollars. The city and state offer some tax breaks, but that is because the project is creating jobs. Additionally, the sports team will draw tourists and provide opportunities for downtown hotels, restaurants, and other businesses when completed. Local stakeholders are adamant that they are paying for the stadium through their taxes. What is something Clint can do to alleviate this?
Debate an opponent on local television
Create a website
Correct answer
Create a training seminar or educational presentation about the stadium
Ignore the critics
Overall explanation
Clint should create a training seminar or class to inform and engage the public. Countering his criticism in person and with facts will go a long way to reversing this trend. Clint could create a website, but a friendly, accurate and informative website would be a great pull communication. Debating a critic on television is not a practical solution and shares the risk of the message being muddled. Ignoring the critics is bound to fuel their anger and misunderstanding.

Joon is a floating project manager with his company. He tends to work with projects in their early stages, especially when they are being staffed with team members. He has a knack for identifying their strengths and weaknesses and designing processes that allow team members to perform their preferred roles. This often allows the teams to grow organically from a firm foundation, at which point less-experienced project managers can take over a team while Joon helps stand up another. Which personality indicator is the project manager displaying?
Systemic
Correct answer
Managerial
Courteous
Creative
Overall explanation
Managerial behavior is the ability to organize and lead groups of people effectively. This requires a sincere interest in the people constituting a team and thorough knowledge of the project's needs. Courteous behavior allows people to empathize with others' positions while also considering their concerns. Creative behavior is marked by the ability to think abstractly or see things differently. Systemic behavior is holistic behavior and is described as working together and for the common good. You might see systemic behavior as the golden rule – treating others as you want to be treated.

In Gordon's latest project, quality audits of the deliverables reveal multiple problems. The management at Gordon's company, Wilson Logistics, has asked him to design a chart that shows the distribution of problems and how often they occur. Of the following choices, which one represents what chart management is requesting?
Correct answer
A Pareto diagram
A control chart
A flowchart
An Ishikawa diagram
Overall explanation
Management wants Gordon to produce a Pareto diagram. Remember, a Pareto diagram lists the causes of defects and shows their frequency. An Ishikawa does not map out how often problems occur and is therefore incorrect. A flowchart is incorrect because it shows how processes move through systems and how the components are related. A control chart is incorrect because it only identifies the relationship of the results to the expected mean; it does not identify problems.

Marc, project manager of a network upgrade project, has faced many challenges in this project. The project management office and the customers are happy with the project completion considering the challenges in the project work. During a final meeting with the customer and the PMO, Marc reports that he could not document lessons learned throughout the project, but he did document the lessons learned at project completion. What would you suggest to Marc as the PMO manager auditing his project processes?
Lessons learned should only be documented at project completion. Marc is on the right track.
It is fine this time as the customers are happy with the project results.
This is acceptable. Lessons learned are intended to be documented at project completion, and Marc did not do anything outside the process.
Correct answer
Lessons learned are documented during the project as well as at project completion. Marc must improve on this in the future.
Overall explanation
Lessons learned should be documented during the project and must not be done solely at project completion. For lessons learned documentation to be effective, it should be completed throughout the project and at project completion. Marc must improve on this in the future to be successful as a project manager. The other options are incorrect since lessons learned should be documented throughout the project, including at project completion.

Sarah uses sprint retrospectives to make her team more effective. The way that she is most likely to do this is
At the beginning of each cycle, she shows the development team a demo of what has been built to date.
At the end of every major production release, they assess each member of the team.
To focus on doing a retrospective only as part of the product planning cycle, not as a specific part of the sprint cycles.
Correct answer
To reflect on increasing customer value and effectiveness through retrospection and adjustment in behaviors going forward.
Overall explanation
Sprint retrospectives are performed to determine areas of improvement and to allow the team to make those adjustments in the future. The retrospective could be during an iteration or release, and Sarah does not need to have a demonstration at the beginning of each cycle focused on developers.

The vendor(s)
Overall explanation
It is the project management team's responsibility to document project scope management decisions. In this scenario, company management does not have the project manager's responsibilities. The project sponsor is incorrect because these stakeholders do not have the project manager's responsibility in this scenario. As stakeholders, vendors do not have the responsibility of a project manager in this example.

In a weak matrix organization, what best describes the role of a project manager?
Functional manager
Support person
Project manager with complete authority

You have been assigned a mentee and have been tasked with teaching her the fundamental concepts of OPM. Although you are unfamiliar with OPM's concept, you decide to research the topic so you can best train your mentee. What is the primary objective of the mentoring initiative within the context of the OPM implementation program?
Increasing retention and diversity in the workplace.
Improving employees' skills outside of the OPM context.
Helping succession planning.
Correct answer
Promote and support changes in how the organization manages its projects, programs, and portfolios.
Overall explanation
The mentoring initiative's primary objective is to promote and support changes in how the organization manages its projects, programs, and portfolios. The other options also relate to mentoring initiatives but are more general in meeting other objectives. Increasing retention and diversity in the workplace is a good goal, but it is not specific to managing projects, programs, and portfolios.

Denise was recently hired as a project manager to replace a project manager who left the organization for a new opportunity. In the process, she was assigned to a contract that was in the negotiation phase. She attended a negotiation session with her sponsor, Truman. During the negotiation, Truman could not keep still, was constantly interrupting, and was consistently disagreeable. He made outlandish demands and was bargaining hard on even the most trivial issues. Truman was threatening, explosive, and denigrating to anyone who disagreed with him. Considering the the DiSC model, what is the sponsor's likely personality type?
Conscientiousness
Steadiness
Correct answer
Dominance
Influence
Overall explanation
The DiSC model groups people into one of four domains: Dominance, Influence, Conscientiousness, and Steadiness. Truman likely has the dominance personality type, which is extroverted, outgoing, and task oriented. This personality can be demonstrated through directness and demanding statements. The Influence domain is demonstrated by the outgoing individual's enthusiasm, optimism, and high-spirited personality. The conscientiousness domain describes people who are reserved, private, precise, and analytical. The steadiness domain includes people who are patient, even-tempered, and humble.

He has decided that he needs to find a way for each team member to understand each other better and communicate more effectively. He believes that if he presents the information he gathers to the team, they can reach a consensus on working together more resolutely. What is an effective and timely way that Fred can do this?
Interview each member of the team individually and allow them to voice their concerns.
Correct answer
Send out a survey asking for all team members' input regarding what they feel can help communication.
Have a meeting off-site for a team-building exercise.
Discuss with team leaders what their insights are and plan a social gathering after work to boost morale.
Overall explanation
Having each team member fill out a survey explaining what they ascertain is the issue and allowing them to describe what works best for them in receiving and disseminating information can help forge a plan that avoids further conflict while addressing the team's relational aspect. While interviewing each team member is an option, setting up meetings and then analyzing and assessing the responses would be time-consuming. Team building exercises can also be used to help build trust, but this answer does not identify why there is a conflict concerning communication. Allowing team leader input is also a valuable resource, yet a particular bias could be involved.

Geri is a new project manager for the NorthWest Company and she is taking over Project DBA. She is getting acclimated to the project by reading status reports for Project DBA when she receives a message from a vice president in the organization. While having high authority in the organization, the vice president is not involved directly with Project DBA. However, he is demanding an update regarding the project. How should Geri handle this situation?
Tell the vice president that she cannot give an update since he is not on the project.
Let the steering committee know about the vice president's request.
Refer the vice president to the knowledge repository for Project DBA.
Correct answer
Give the vice president a quick update and add them to ongoing updates.
Overall explanation
Despite not being on this project, a vice president likely has a high amount of influence. Providing them with updates will satisfy their need for information and keep them from negatively influencing the project. The vice president may need the information to plan other work, budget expenses, or get a sense the project is performing compared to other projects in the portfolio. Rejecting the vice president's request is likely to cause negative consequences for the project and Geri. Deflecting the vice president to the knowledge repository may work but is not the best way to treat a stakeholder. However, including them in active updates is a better choice. Informing the steering committee does not satisfy the vice president's request for information.

Jessica is the project manager for Project Octo, eight weeks into implementation and two weeks behind schedule. Stakeholders have complained to Jessica that recent deliverables frequently have to be sent back for rework. These errors cost the project time and additional funds. What is the next best thing for Jessica to do?
Correct answer
Review and update the project's quality assurance plan.
Have the stakeholders detail everything wrong with the deliverables.
Review and update the project's quality control plan.
Escalate the problem to her steering committee.
Overall explanation
Jessica should review and update the quality assurance plan as this plan dictates how the project will deploy items of expected quality. Quality assurance is about doing the work correctly the first time, and quality control is about inspecting the work to ensure mistakes are kept away from the customers' hands. The best choice is to do the work correctly the first time. The quality control plan addresses issues after they have been created. While quality control needs improvement, it is best to do the work correctly the first time rather than redoing the work to correct mistakes. Having the stakeholder detail every issue will not help solve poor quality within the project. Escalating to the steering committee will not help solve the quality problem Project Octo is facing.

Dom, the project sponsor, contacts you and asks for details on managing and balancing time, cost, and scope in your project. What document would be best for Dom to review?
Work breakdown structure, scope statement, and charter
Correct answer
Project management plan
Status reports
Project charter
Overall explanation
Dom is asking for a project management plan. A project management plan contains domain-specific plans, for example, a scope management plan. The project management plan serves as a guide to how the project will be managed. The correct answer is not a project charter because a project charter does not guide how a project is managed and does not contain information specific to scope or cost. A status report shows the current status of the project and does not show intent in project execution. A work breakdown structure is a visualization of the project scope decomposition; it does not address how the project will manage time, cost, and scope.

Add more time to the project timeline.
Correct answer

The most effective way to put stakeholders’ concerns over agile methods to rest is to educate them and keep them informed of the project’s progress. Stakeholders will not buy into the agile method simply because they are told it has worked in the past or that it is the way of the future. In an iteration, stakeholders give input to decisions, the team goes to work, and then near the end of the iteration, the team meets again with the stakeholders to present the progress that has been made.

At Iceberg Lounge, Rebecca and the relevant stakeholders have identified a few features and user stories in her project that are high-risk. What is the best way for her to deal with these in an agile approach?
Correct answer
Work on the risky user stories and features as early in the project as possible to confirm that the technological approach is sound.
Remove these user stories and features from the sprint plan and place them in the backlog until other factors can reduce the amount of risk.
Work on these items after the first few sprints, when an architectural spike has been scheduled.
Work on one high-risk user story per sprint to minimize the risk to each iteration.
Overall explanation
The primary way to deal with high-risk user stories and features is to complete them as early as possible to reduce risk. You do not need an architectural spike to address risks. High-risk work should not be delayed or approach slowly. You would not remove user stories to avoid risk in a sprint.

She is certified as a project manager in predictive and agile approaches. Management has asked Tracy to attend project management training and she is a little offended at the recommendation. Why is it essential for a project manager to attend training?
Correct answer
To enhance their skill set to be better leaders.
To network in the event if their current position does not work out.
To get away from the chaos of their team and the stress of a project.
To show management that they are worthy of a raise.
Overall explanation
Despite her current certifications and experience, there is always new information and approaches to becoming an even better project manager. Being a good leader is more than just telling your team what they are to do. Learning to be flexible, humble, focused, and having integrity among your team and peers is essential. A good leader is one that a team will listen to and respect. Taking time to grow your knowledge and skills and further developing your communication skills is vital to lead project teams and work with stakeholders. Getting away from the chaos and stress of the project is not a valid reason for additional training. The results of work and education may lead to new opportunities and better pay, but these are not the primary reasons one should attend training. Looking for new job opportunities is not a good reason to attend training.

Skyler's primary stakeholder prefers to take a granular view of whatever project she is currently working on.

As a result, she often requests screen-sharing sessions or phone calls to ask questions about the latest project features. This happens on a release-by-release basis, and she becomes very cautious about features that Skyler's team has not explained. Which method should the project manager use to build trust and influence with the stakeholder?
Correct answer
Meetings
Progress reporting
Surveys
Issue identification
Overall explanation
Meetings can be a useful way to build trust and influence with stakeholders if they have a lot of free time and prefer to work through issues organically. Although this is a time-consuming option, it can increase trust between the stakeholder and project manager. Issue identification is the best way to build additional trust and influence with a stakeholder who already has a high level of trust with the project team. This choice is not appropriate since the stakeholder, in this case, is interested in all the work being done, not just issues. Progress reporting is helpful if stakeholders prefer to keep a close watch on the status of projects. Surveys are appropriate if a stakeholder requires the input of a large number of people in addition to the project manager's personal input.

Prioritize only items that add up to 80 points, which is the team’s expected velocity.
Review the items that are scheduled for the next sprint, only reprioritizing those, leaving the changes and defects for a future release.
Correct answer
Prioritize chosen items in the backlog, including change requests, and defects, potentially changing the priority on any of the items in the backlog.
Overall explanation
The product owner can prioritize items of any type in the backlog, including adding or editing priority. Change in the backlog is expected throughout the project. B and C are incorrect because the product owner is not limited to what they can prioritize, either by the type of item, by whether it has been prioritized before, or by a certain number of points.

You are the project manager of the AllSky Project for your organization. You are leading your team in a predictive project to install the network topology in a new campus your company will be moving to soon. The project will create a physical network and Wi-Fi access points. There will be some public access points, but the organization requires security and assurance that the public will not see any of the private networks. There is currently an issue with a defective piece of hardware, and now the manufacturer reports it may take three months to deliver a replacement. What project document needs to be updated next?
Lessons learned register
Risk register
Correct answer
Issue log
Quality management plan
Overall explanation
The issue log needs to be updated as this is something that has happened, not something that may happen. Issues are risk events, known or unknown, that have occurred in the project and are now causing problems. The issue log records the events, assigns an issue owner to manage the event, and tracks the issue to completion. The lessons learned register is the place where previous knowledge about mistakes or best practices is kept. Quality management plans are measures used to ensure that quality stays above a certain level or within a certain range. The risk register is where risk events are recorded; recall that risks are uncertain events, whereas this is a certain event.

Farah is the project manager of a new agile project for Stoney Trucking. Her team has identified a serious problem, although it probably will not occur until late in the project's timeline. Although the problem is not likely to occur until late in the project, what is the best approach for Farah and her team to minimize the impact?
Correct answer
Identify and diagnose the problem early; fix it as soon as possible.
Come up with a solution to the problem but make it a task in the next iteration.
Ignore the problem.
Wait until later in the project to fix the problem – do not have the team waste time on it now.
Overall explanation
To minimize the problem's impact on the project, Farah and her team need to identify and diagnose the problem early and fix it as soon as possible. If they don't, the problem could soon affect the rest of the project. Ignoring the problem does nothing to help fix the problem and can potentially cause more issues in the project's future. Waiting until later in the project to fix the problem allows the possibility of the problem getting bigger. It also does nothing to prepare the team for finding a solution. Making the solution to the problem a task in the next iteration is another delay tactic. Project leaders need to address problems with the project team as soon as possible.

As a project manager of an expansive and highly visible project within your organization, you have worked diligently to develop your stakeholder engagement strategy. When is the appropriate time to start managing your stakeholders, and why?
An engagement plan is unnecessary as this is a highly visible project, and everyone knows what is taking place.
Correct answer
At the beginning of the project, to understand stakeholder needs early on, when stakeholders are most likely to accept the change.
At any time throughout the project, stakeholder engagement is not necessary since the plan is available for everyone to see.
Near the end of the project, the finished product is ready to be released and utilized.
Overall explanation
At the beginning of the project, to understand stakeholder needs early on, when stakeholders are most likely to accept the change. It is important to engage with your stakeholders as early as possible and understand their requirements and needs. Early engagement will increase the chances of satisfying all stakeholders. Engagement at any other time in the project poses risks to the project's success because stakeholder requirements may not be identified or captured. Stakeholder engagement plans may include sensitive information and should be kept confidential.

Glenna has been informed by her management team that she must flatten her project through resource-leveling. If Glenna's team members can only contribute 28 hours per week, what is the likely outcome of her project schedule?
Correct answer
The project schedule time will increase.
The project schedule time will decrease.
The critical path of the project will change.
Glenna, as the project manager, will have to use the critical chain method.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is the project schedule time will increase, and the project's scheduled duration will most likely increase when it is flattened through resource-leveling. Usage of the critical chain method will not likely affect the project's duration and is, therefore, an incorrect response. There is no evidence the critical path will change; therefore, it is an incorrect answer. The project schedule will not decrease and therefore is an incorrect response.

Victoria, the project manager for Golden Logistics, has been asked by her management team to use the CPM approach in her network diagram. Because she is not familiar with this approach, Victoria asks for help from co-workers to finish this part of her project work. Of the following responses, which is a correct attribute of the critical path?
The critical path has the costliest project activities.
Correct answer
The critical path determines the earliest date of completion.
The critical path possesses the most activities in the PND.
The critical path contains the highest amount of float.
Overall explanation
The critical path determines the earliest completion date is the best and is the correct answer here. The path with the longest duration, the critical path, communicates the earliest and latest day the project can be finished. However, there can be times when the project's expected completion date goes well beyond the duration of work scheduled. In this circumstance, the critical path is the path considered to have the least amount of float. The critical path is not necessarily the path with the most expensive activities. The critical path containing the highest float is an incorrect response because it has the smallest float. The critical path is the path with the longest duration, not the one with the most activities in the PND.

She recently received a project status report which included updates to several critical tasks, including adjusting task relationships. Samantha is unsure why these changes were made. She asks Amber, the project manager, for more information. How is Amber likely to respond?
The new order fits the team's vacation calendar better.
The new order includes new requirements.
The new order includes scope increases.
Correct answer
The new order avoids previously unknown obstacles.
Overall explanation
Given the time the project has been running, it is likely previously unknown obstacles presented themselves. These obstacles may be mitigated by adjusting the task schedule. Amber should have communicated this better to Samantha to avoid confusion and any anxiety about the project. Accommodating the team's vacation is not a good reason to adjust critical tasks. The project update should have included information on new tasks. Scope increases should not be communicated via project updates and instead should go through change control.

You are concerned about the stakeholder with power, such as the governmental stakeholders. You also know that many stakeholders are eager for this project to be launched and underway. Which model for stakeholders would you choose?
Correct answer
Salience model
Participation matrix
Context diagram
Influence/ impact grid
Overall explanation
The salience model is a three-dimensional model that considers the stakeholders' power, legitimacy, and urgency. The influence/ impact grid shows only two aspects of the stakeholders' interest in the project, so it is not the best choice. A context diagram is used to map out the interactions and boundaries of a system, not stakeholder engagement. A participation matrix is not a valid project management term.

During the kick-off meeting, she is approached by Vendor A, who stated that they would not work in the same building as one of their competing vendors (Vendor B). The vendor selection has already been made, and work has begun. How does she reconcile this conflict?
She should accommodate Vendor A and schedule Vendor B only when Vendor A is not working in the building.
She should inform Vendor A that she does not have the time to deal with their petty squabbles and inform them that we all have jobs to do.
Correct answer
She should meet with Vendor A and Vendor B to determine their conflict and how best to resolve it to complete this project's deadline.
She should direct Vendor A to the signed contract and inform them that they are contractually obligated to perform their work regardless of Vendor B's presence.
Overall explanation
Collaborating/problem solving allows the incorporating of multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives. This approach can result in a win-win situation. Forcing a decision by referring immediately to the contract does not resolve the issue for the betterment of the project. This choice is authoritarian and does not attempt to resolve the issue.

A vendor proposal
A quotation
Project requirements
Correct answer
A contract
Overall explanation
A contract can be used as a mitigation tool and is the correct answer. Transference is the procurement of risky activities – the risk still exists, but the responsibility is transferred to the vendor. A quotation is just the price of the contracted work and it does not do anything to reduce or eliminate the risk. The project requirements are the goals, metrics, and deliverables the project must create to reach project completion. A proposal is more than just the price for the work; it includes ideas and some sales language about why the buyer should choose the vendor.

By submission of the change request to the contract change control system
In the form of a memo and SOW signed by Carmella and the vendor
By a change request being submitted to the cost change control system

Overall explanation
The correct and best answer here is by submitting the change request to the contract change control system. The vendor is being asked to update the agreement. Change should follow the guidelines of the contract change control system. This is not a viable answer and is therefore incorrect. This is incorrect because it is not a viable response.

The WBS defines requirements for specific contract work.
Correct answer
The WBS details the specific contracted work and must support the project customer's requirements.
The WBS defines specific contracted work.
Both parties must retain a copy of the WBS.
Overall explanation
The correct response is the WBS details the specific contracted work and must support the customer's requirements. In the determination of what must be procured, this information is a valuable input. The WBS defines a project's end result. When dealing with vendors to procure a portion of the project, the procured work must include the customer's requirements. This response is incorrect because the WBS does not define contract work requirements. A vendor will most likely not have a copy of the WBS; therefore, this response is incorrect.

Review the associated compliance requirements with all key stakeholders from each state where employees reside.
Overall explanation
Sarah should work with her sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders to create a shared understanding of success criteria. It also increases the likelihood of deliverable acceptance when the project is complete and stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project. Reviewing enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and organizational process assets (OPAs) with the key stakeholders is not the best next step.

During the daily scrum, Regina asked Thomas, another developer, whether a specific task could be marked as completed or not. She needs the task completed to move forward with another task she wants to work on achieving. What information would help resolve this dispute?

The definition of done is an agreed-upon definition that defines when a task is considered complete. This will help Regina determine if a task is done or not. Although it is not presented as a choice, a better answer in this scenario would be for Thomas to communicate with Regina that a task is done. Agile wants things simple, transparent, and for the team to communicate easily. The sprint backlog is a list of the tasks the team must complete to finish the items selected for the current iteration.

During a recent team meeting, Kathy suggests removing the code review from each item to speed up development. What is her scrum master likely to say or do in response to this idea?
The scrum master will likely say to assign a senior developer to explore the idea.
Correct answer
The scrum master will likely explain to Kathy that code reviews help ensure higher quality, which helps avoid costly rework.
The scrum master will likely suggest scheduling a spike to explore the idea.
The scrum master will likely state to write it up and submit a proposal to the product owner.
Overall explanation
Quality must be monitored continuously, and stages like code reviews are an excellent way to help ensure quality. Removing these steps may speed up the process but at the risk of introducing poor quality. Writing this up as a proposal is not a good option, and quality checks are necessary. Assigning a senior developer is a waste of time as code reviews are necessary. Spikes are used for exploring new technology or ideas.

Leroy, a stakeholder, has made a serious miscalculation about the number of users for a website that Jenny's team produces. Rather than admit his mistake, Leroy doubles down and begins telling the other stakeholders that there will be fewer users than Jenny's calculations suggest, making it difficult to secure the necessary funding from the project's sponsor. Jenny is surprised because Leroy's judgment and conduct are typically excellent. In fact, before the project's initiation, Leroy was one of Jenny's strongest advocates. To decide if she should petition her sponsor to remove Leroy from the project, Jenny decides to re-appraise Leroy's skills by reviewing some of the projects he previously worked on. Which error should she try to avoid?
Central tendency error
Strictness or leniency error
Personal Bias
Correct answer
Recency error
Overall explanation
The recency error occurs when an appraiser over-exaggerates a good or bad event simply because it occurred recently. The exaggeration usually occurs at the expense of other good or bad achievements, making it difficult for an appraiser to understand the value provided or damage done.

Fern is the project manager at Withrow Holdings and Janet, her supervisor, is concerned that Fern will possibly accept one of the project risks. Fern explains to Janet that this risk should be accepted within the project. When is it an appropriate time to accept a project risk?
Correct answer
If the risk is in conjunction with the reward, it is appropriate to accept the risk.
If a project team has never finished this type of project before, the risk is appropriate to accept.
Every risk must be mitigated and transferred.
There is never an appropriate time to accept project risk.
Overall explanation
It is an appropriate time to accept risk when it is in balance with the reward. Answer 1 is incorrect because all risks do not need to be mitigated or transferred; some are worth accepting, exploiting, escalating, enhancing, or sharing. Answer 2 is incorrect since it is entirely appropriate to accept risk in some circumstances. Answer 3 is incorrect because it is a false response to risk management.

Carrie is the scrum master for a project in its ninth iteration with a velocity of 29 story points. Recently Carrie's team has had trouble working with an operations team on finalizing some user stories and the definition of done for the features. Her project team is concerned this will continue to delay work. Which of the following options is the best one for Carrie?
Escalate the issue to her steering committee and the product owner.
Ask for the troublesome individuals on the operations team to be reassigned.
Correct answer
Meet with the manager of the operations team and the product owner to sort out the issue.
Discuss the issue with the project team to come up with a solution to resolve this issue.
Overall explanation
Carrie should connect with the operations team manager and the product owner, outline the challenge, and work together to resolve it. Escalating the matter to her steering committee is not ideal as they will not easily resolve the issue. The steering committee expects the project manager and the product owner to work through these types of issues. Reassigning the troublesome resources will not help determine the underlying cause of the delays. The project team is not the best option as they may be unable to resolve the issue themselves.

Ahmed manages a historic library restoration project in his community and works with specialized contractors to perform carpentry on the library's exterior. His contractor is thirty-five percent through their contracted work when Ahmed determines a minor change in the scope required to adhere to the city council's restoration guidelines. Ahmed submits a change request to update the project baselines, and the change control board approves the request through the integrated change control process. In which of the following processes will the approved scope changes be implemented?
Correct answer
Control procurements
Plan scope management
Control scope
Direct and manage project work
Overall explanation
Since the approved change request is related to a contract, control procurements will implement the change. Directing and managing project work oversees project team activities, which does not apply because this is performed from a contract. Plan scope management is the process of creating a scope management plan. Control scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and the product's scope.

In his first meeting as a stakeholder on an agile software development team, Mikal is surprised to find only ten people on the team. Because it is a large implementation, he was expecting a much larger group. Of the following, which explains the small team size?
Correct answer
Per agile method recommendations, a delivery team should consist of 12 or fewer people.
It was difficult to find team members because the agile methodology is so new.
Very specialized roles are needed for agile methods.
Only one team member was chosen from each department.
Overall explanation
So that team members can form relationships and communicate in the most direct fashion, agile methods suggest a team of 12 or fewer people. Agile team members are chosen based on their ability to take shared ownership of a project; their commitment to a common goal; their ability to agree on how goals are measured. In the event that more team members are needed, subteams will be formed and they will coordinate their work. In an organization, the newness of the agile method is not the best choice for the team size limit. Agile teams are formed by skill, not by representatives from each department. Project teams require generalizing specialists in the agile methodology.

You are the project manager for the New Appliance Company and have been serving as a project manager for the past eight years. Management has just given you the task of introducing a new kitchen appliance to your end-users, as recent feedback has shown they are not satisfied with their current devices. As part of your assignment, you want to demonstrate your product to your expected clients at a tradeshow for the vendors that will sell your products. Which of the following is NOT an interest in this group of individuals?
Visible progress
Better quality
Correct answer
Work-life balance
Ability to steer and influence the project
Overall explanation
Work-life balance is an interest more closely associated with the development team, not the organization's potential customers. Vendors will want to contribute to the features and functions of the product your organization creates. Better quality will be a concern for resellers of your products, so you will need to define the balance of quality and costs. Visible progress will be a concern to your vendors as your project completion will affect when they can sell the products.

Benjamin is the project manager of the Robinson Plastic Project. If there is more than a 7 percent error in production, Benjamin and the manufacturer have agreed to substitute the product's plastic type with a slightly thicker version. Though errors should cease, the thicker plastic will increase costs and require a slowdown in production. This is an example of which of the following choices?
Correct answer
Threshold
Tracking
Budgeting
JIT Manufacturing
Overall explanation
The correct response is a threshold, and an error value of 7 percent is the threshold under which the project can run. If the number of errors goes beyond 7 percent, a new type of plastic will replace the current kind. Budgeting is incorrect because the scenario deals with identifying the risk threshold, not the cost affiliated with the risk event. JIT Manufacturing, which is defined as a scheduling technique in which materials are ordered only when needed to keep inventory costs down, is incorrect. Tracking is process documentation through a workflow or system, or the documentation of events through the process, and is incorrect.

The Control Quality process is in place to prevent non-compliance in project deliverables, recommend defect repairs, changes, and corrective and preventive actions, to integrative change control.
The Control Quality process is where project deliverables need to comply with quality standards that are relevant.
Correct answer
The Control Quality process is the completion of the defined scope where the project work should be directed.
The Control Quality process is the quality baseline phase in approved changes.
Overall explanation
The Control Scope process monitors the adherence to the project scope, not the Control Quality process. The Control Quality process is useful in identifying the causes of negative results. The Control Quality process is in place to prevent non-compliance in project deliverables, recommend defect repairs, changes, and corrective and preventive actions, to integrative change control. The quality baseline is proven by the quality control processes. Quality is achieved through conformance to requirements and a product that is fit for usage. The Control Quality process looks at certain project results to see if they are in compliance with relevant quality standards.

Liza is the project manager responsible for the success of a five-phased project. The project is mid-way through the third phase when she realizes that two major requirements compete. What should Liza use to help evaluate what requirement is best for her project?
The requirement that will shorten the schedule.
Correct answer
The requirement that is most aligned to the project's business case.
The requirement that will generate the most ROI.
The requirement stipulated by a stakeholder with more experience.
Overall explanation
Liza should work with the requirement that is most aligned to the business case. The requirement that will generate the most ROI, the requirement that will shorten the schedule and the stakeholder's requirement with more experience all can be unrelated to the project's rationale. The most aligned requirement to the project's business case is the most closely related requirement to the project's rationale. The requirement that will generate the most ROI is not the best answer as the requirements should be aligned to the project's business case. The requirement stipulated from a stakeholder with more experience is not the best answer as the requirements should be aligned to the project's business case.

Your team members attend their first meeting where they introduce each other, describe their previous experiences, and contribute to the team. The team leader also wants to establish the ground rules for the rest of the project, and you agree. Which description best describes why ground rules are established for the team?
Correct answer
To ensure that the team has a set of governing practices that can be used to baseline behaviors
To prevent conflicts during the lifecycle of the project.
To set out what guidelines the team will adhere to when making decisions.
To outline clear roles and responsibilities for every team member.
Overall explanation
Ground rules are established in a collaborative environment to maximize buy-in from all team members. They ensure that the team has a set of governing practices that can be used to baseline behaviors and ensure that the team functions as a high-performing team. Ground rules are established in a collaborative environment to maximize buy-in from all team members. This option implies that the ground rules have been set by a person of authority and pushed down. Ground rules do not deal with roles and responsibilities; they are rather statements of values and guidelines. Ground rules cannot prevent conflicts; conflicts may happen even with ground rules and are often helpful for the project team. Ground rules govern the behaviors and decisions made during hard times.

Kate's project sponsor has asked her to deliver project value as quickly as possible. She is to begin planning early next week. How should Kate deliver value quickly?
Correct answer
Manage the project with an incremental development life cycle.
Ask her team to work overtime to develop a prototype.
Manage the project with waterfall development.
Contract out some development to bring in the schedule.
Overall explanation
Kate should manage the project with an incremental development life cycle. This allows for the product to be useable earlier on. A waterfall development will take development much longer and prevent the value from being delivered early. Asking her team to work overtime to develop a prototype is not necessary as the project has not yet entered the planning stages. Contracting out development is not necessary as the project has not yet entered the planning stages.

Daphne is a construction project manager who is building her first skyscraper, which is 40% complete. She started with houses and smaller office buildings and feels good about her grasp of building codes. However, with a project this large, it is impossible to inspect everything herself. Daphne can spot bad framing from a mile away, but electrical work is not her strong suit. She generally tries to hire good electricians and trusts in their efforts. On this project, however, she has multiple electrician firms of varying reputations. She catches wind of a couple of electrical issues that are functional but may not be up to code. How can Daphne ensure that she complies with the electrical code?
Wait for inspection at the end of the project and react.
Fire all the electricians and start fresh.
Assume the reported issues are isolated and fix them as reported.
Correct answer
Hire an independent firm to inspect the work.
Overall explanation
Daphne cannot afford to wait for final inspections to reveal problems. If the issues are many and systematic, this could involve tearing open walls, redo entire floors, and dealing with other expensive fixes. Daphne should hire an independent and trusted electrical firm to inspect the work for her. They can look for potential problems, suggest fixes, and pinpoint the contractors doing the shoddy work to make adjustments. Since the skyscraper is still somewhat skeleton, it is the right time to make sure electrical work complies and is up to code. Daphne cannot afford to wait for final inspections to reveal problems. She needs to deal with the issue as soon as possible to avoid any further issues. It would be dangerous to assume that the issues are isolated. Firing the electricians and starting fresh is an example of looking for an answer she wants and does help the project be in alignment with the electrical code.

Natasha, the development team, and the product owner work together to write the user story and then review how the story will be prioritized in the product backlog. Which of the following statements best describes what is happening in this scenario?
Defining the riskiness of a user story for completion in a risk spike
Checklist creation in a sprint review
Servant leadership for the value of the project during a sprint retrospective
Correct answer
Teamwork and backlog grooming in sprint planning
Overall explanation
During sprint planning, the team works together to write the new user story and review the product backlog with the product owner. The product owner is responsible for grooming the backlog. The team and the scrum master can help as it may affect the work in the next sprint. This is not a checklist but a user story. The sprint review comes at the end of a sprint and demonstrates what the team has created. Risk is not an issue in this scenario. Retrospectives are an opportunity for the team to review what is or is not working and look at options to improve the project in future sprints.

Resource constraints
Organizational interfaces

Correct answer
Staffing requirements
Overall explanation
The project needs the resource of the chemical engineer to be successful. When the project needs a resource, it is a staffing requirement. Organizational interfaces describe the representative or touchpoints for departments or lines of business within an organization. Contractor requirements describe the procurement requirements and agreements with the vendor for a contracted employee within the organization.

Matthew is a project manager within an organization that has traditionally used a command-and-control style of project management. However, business analysts have recommended that their competitors have seen a lot more success by adopting agile project management methodologies. The management team has tasked Matthew with conducting a pilot project using the agile methods. Which of the following characteristics should Matthew not consider when selecting a pilot project?
Correct answer
A detailed project management plan
Three- to a six-month schedule
Real business need
High visibility
Overall explanation
Matthew should not create a detailed project management plan associated with a traditional waterfall methodology. The project should be big enough to be deemed a real project but short enough to use the benefits quickly. A real business need should not be a toy project, but a real one that people know needs to be done and are likely to be troubled by the same issues as other projects.

Prevention costs are related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services for this transitional project. Appraisal costs measure the quality of the product being developed and include testing and inspections. Internal failure costs are failures found by the project and include scrap or the cost to repair the product.

Midway through developing a complex software program, Alana, a senior developer, mentions that there is a slight possibility that the server that the code relies on may crash. If the server crashes, there is a potential that the project's progress over the last week will be lost. As a result, you call together the network engineers and server administrators to create a mitigation plan for this newly identified risk. The team agrees that a second server would offer redundancy and prevent a loss in project time. What should you do next?
Correct answer
Update the risk register with the mitigation plan and assign a risk owner.
Update the risk management plan with the mitigation response and assign Alana as the identifier.
Update the resource management plan as the new server is a resource.
Update the issue log with the issue Alana has identified and mark her as the issue owner.
Overall explanation
You should update the risk register with the mitigation plan and assign a risk owner. Risks are recorded and tracked in the risk register. You would only update the risk register, not the issue log, at this point. An issue is a risk event that has occurred. The second server is a resource and should be updated in the resource register. However, the question asks for the next thing you should do. Before updating the resource management plan, you should first update the risk register. The risk management plan defines how risks will be identified, planned for, tracked, and responded to in the project. The individual project risks are documented in the risk register, not the risk management plan.

To ensure the project includes all the required work, and only the required work, to finish the project successfully.
It defines the baseline for project acceptance.

Overall explanation
Project scope management defines the processes to ensure the project includes all required work and only the required work to complete the project successfully. Functional managers assigned to the project are incorrect because they are not addressed in project scope management.

James is a very creative individual and has decided to enhance a product's features during the development phase, which he was assigned to, knowing it will not negatively impact the project. However, he did not consult Mandy, his project manager, on the changes ahead of implementing them. What should Mandy do first now that her team member has added enhancement to a product without impacting time, cost, and quality?
Ask the team member why they feel additional enhancement(s) are required.
Correct answer
Discuss with the team member how they know there is no time, cost, or quality impact.
Confirm that the customer is willing to incur this added expense.
Consult the business team to assess the value of the improvement.
Overall explanation
Team members come in and out of various phases, depending on their roles. The team members do not always have the same view of projects as their project manager. The project manager sees the entire project, is most familiar with organizational objectives, and can better evaluate the project's impact with the team's assistance. Asking the team members why they added the enhancements is important, but the answer will not explain how the team member knows there is no impact on the project's time, cost, or quality. Asking the business team to identify the value of the improvement is important. However, the project manager should first acquire the team member's justification for the change. Confirming that the customer is willing to incur this added expense is not necessary at this point because, according to the team member, the change did not impact the project's time, cost, or quality.

Overall explanation
Velocity is the term used to describe the stabilized amount of user story points a team can complete in a sprint. Deliverables is a generic project management term to describe the completed items the team has delivered as a result of the project work. Kanban completion is not a valid project management term. Kanban means signboard and is a way to pull work items from the waiting queue into production and through all phases of the project work to completion.

Which one of the following best describes the portion of a project life cycle in this scenario?
This is part of project initiation.
Correct answer
This is a pre-project, so this is origination.
This is part of requirements elicitation, so this planning.
This is pre-project, conceptual.
Overall explanation
This project is in the origination phase. A project proposal is a document assessing a project's viability before the project is committed to and begins. A project proposal is the first artifact of a project and is created before a project charter. Some may call this stage project conception or conceptual, but the preferred project management term is origination. Project initiation happens once the project is approved and begins with the project charter. Planning happens after the project charter, so this choice is incorrect.

Manny requires the team to meet via video conference at the beginning of each workday for 15 minutes to achieve these goals. Which of the following would likely not be included in the daily meeting?
Review tasks just competed, current agenda, and roadblocks.
Action items to be completed today.
Correct answer

Detailed discussions and issue resolution should be offline in a video conference with those involved with the issue. Manny is hosting a daily standup, also called the Daily Scrum ceremony, where team members report on what they have done since the last meeting, what they are doing today and any impediments to moving forward. Review tasks just competed, current agenda, and roadblocks are part of the daily standup, so this choice is incorrect. Catch up on non-work events and share lighthearted humor, to a limited extent, is a good way to warm up the team and get the conversation started.

Interpersonal communication
Mass communication
Public communication
Correct answer
Small group communication
Overall explanation
Mac should utilize small group communication. Small group communications are useful for small teams or subject matter experts and knowledgeable stakeholders but are unlikely to yield consensus among large groups of stakeholders. Interpersonal communication allows stakeholders to clarify their point of view without provoking a reaction from other stakeholders or team members. Public communications are useful for quickly alerting large groups of users and stakeholders but are generally poor tools for gathering consensus. Mass communication, such as a website or video, is for large groups of stakeholders.

A week later, while reviewing the timecards for employees on his team, Fritz notices that all the new employees have been working twice as many hours as expected. What is the root cause of the misunderstanding?
Lack of leadership
Lack of active listening
Correct answer
Lack of cultural awareness
Lack of stakeholder management
Overall explanation
A lack of cultural awareness generally occurs when people from different backgrounds overlook contextual clues that might be obvious to people from the same background. In this case, the employees took the project manager at his word without understanding that he was joking. Active listening includes asking questions in one's own words to confirm understanding or solicit additional information. It might have been useful here, but the cultural factors are more significant. A lack of stakeholder management stems from allowing stakeholders to overstep the boundaries necessary for completing a project. A lack of leadership occurs when there is no vision or inspiration to run the project correctly. Neither applies.

Janice is a project manager for ACE Corporation. Earlier in her current project, she noticed team members struggled to fill out their time reports appropriately. These reports are a critical source of information to track the cost and duration of the project. The information is used to predict costs and to measure progress against the amount of labor exerted. Janice partnered with a stakeholder to provide training to the team on the time system, and that training has just been completed. What should Janice do next?
Do nothing. The team has been appropriately trained.
Tell the stakeholder that the time tracking challenges are resolved.
Correct answer
Actively monitor how the team uses the system to ensure that the training was successful.
Celebrate the accomplishment with the team.
Overall explanation
Now that training has been provided, Janice needs to monitor outcomes to determine if the training was successful. This may take the form of baselining behaviors, comparing results, or interviewing the team. Doing nothing will not tell Janice if the training was successful. While completing training may be an accomplishment and cause for celebration, Janice still needs to know if the training worked.

Mentoring
Directing
Correct answer
Coaching
Training
Overall explanation
Coaching is the correct response. The right time to address individual team members is during an iteration, not in between. If in between iterations, it is best to address the entire team. Coaching helps the team member improve their skills, stay on track, and deal with issues effectively. Directing, when a project manager gives specific instructions on how to perform a task, is not something typically done in agile projects. Teaching a skill by instruction is the definition of training, and it is very structured. This scenario is not right for a training session.

Rebecca is hosting a pre-mortem event with her team before they begin the first iteration. They do all the following in this meeting except
Imagine future project failure.
Correct answer
Assess the financial impact of each of the potential failures.
Revisit their initial plan.
Generate potential reasons for future project failure.
Overall explanation
Assessing the financial impact of a failure is not part of this exercise. The team will revisit the initial plan, imagine future project failure to try to avoid the failure, and look for reasons that might cause failure in the project.

Jack is a new team member recently added to the data development team. The data development team recently reached a milestone and was rewarded with a $100 bonus. Even though Jack was a new addition to the team, he received the $100 bonus just as the other team members did. Why would the project manager choose to reward a new addition to the team the same bonus as other team members? Choose the best answer
People are motivated when they feel valued, and not giving Jack the $100 bonus may have sent a poor message.
Project managers should apply rewards evenly across a team regardless of the number of team members.
Correct answer
The plan resource management process determined that everyone on the team receives the same reward if any.
The project manager was avoiding confrontation by rewarding everyone the same bonus.
Overall explanation
The original plan for rewarding people is developed during the plan resource management process. The project manager follows the resource management plan and pays all the team members according to the plan. It is true that people are motivated when they feel valued, but the best answer is the resource management plan has already defined the rewards system. This is not the best choice, as the resource management plan has defined how the rewards and recognition system operates in the project. The project manager avoiding confrontation may feel true, but this is not the best answer. The resource management plan defines how people will be rewarded in the project.

Jonette is developing a schedule for the project management plan to construct a commercial kitchen for a catering company. Jonette is using the precedence diagramming method (PDM) to determine what order tasks should be done. She has scheduled the refrigeration unit's installation to begin at the same time as the installation of the freezer unit. Which of the following components, dependencies, or logical relationships best describes the scenario above?
Finish-to-start (FS)
Start-to-finish (SF)
Correct answer
Start-to-start (SS)
Finish-to-finish (FF)
Overall explanation
The start-to-start dependency best describes the scenario above. The same electrical source likely powers the electrical systems for both units so they can be installed simultaneously. Start-to-finish (SF) is where a successor activity cannot finish until the predecessor activity begins. Finish-to-start (FS) is where a successor activity cannot finish until the predecessor activity finishes. Finish-to-finish (FF) is where one activity cannot finish until another activity is finished.

Susan is a young project manager who has inherited a team that is not working to its potential. The team is reserved both with her and with each other. This behavior has been observed by others when Susan is not present. The previous project manager was eager to hand off the project to Susan without much insight into team dynamics. Susan knows that several team members have reputations for enthusiasm and teamwork, but those traits are not being expressed within the team. What is the best way for Susan to determine the source of the conflict and resolve it?
Correct answer
Collaborate. Get the team members talking and work on resolutions.
Forcefulness. As a young PM, Susan needs to show them who the boss is.
Avoidance. There is no conflict if no one is fighting.
Smooth things over by presenting everything calmly and hope it approves.
Overall explanation
Collaboration, which includes communication and working towards solutions, is the best choice. Collaboration will get issues out in the open and will potentially endear the team towards Susan.  Avoidance will keep the team from reaching its potential even if there is no outward or noisy conflict. Susan is unlikely to win support if her first moves are forceful or heavy-handed. Smoothing downplays the disagreements and does not resolve the emotional intelligence problems within the problem.

You are the project manager of a large, complex technical project for your organization. This project has a budget of $2,500,000 and is due for completion in six months. In a weekly meeting with your project's sponsor, it is brought to your attention that a large portion of the scope will be cut from the project. The work that was to be done was originally going to be provided by a contractor. Your organization and the contractor have already signed the contract. What should you do first?
Issue payment for the work provided, but not for the work that has not been completed.
Correct answer
Review the contract terms with your procurement office.
Tell the contractor to stop all work.
Tell the procurement office not to issue payment to the contractor.
Overall explanation
While these options seem reasonable, none of these are appropriate until you review the contract terms. Ideally, you should review the contract terms with someone from the procurement office or with a legal understanding. Depending on the terms, you may tell the contractor to stop work, you might not need to issue any payment, or you may only need to issue partial payment. However, it is impossible to know what the options are until you have reviewed the contract. Telling the contractor to stop all work may be feasible after reviewing the terms of the contract. Telling the procurement office not to issue payment to the contractor likely is not a good choice as the contract terms need to be reviewed first. In addition, there may have been work completed that the organization must pay the contractor for. Issuing payment for the work provided but not for the work that has not been completed seems like an excellent choice, but the contract terms should be reviewed first.

Quinten is the project manager for a project at Service Corporation that is on budget but two weeks behind schedule. This project has a tight deadline, and project costs can be no greater than three percent of the planned budget. Recently a project team member communicated that a particular risk they had identified in project planning has occurred. What should Quinten do next?
Correct answer
Refer to the risk register.
Apply the management reserve.
Inform the steering committee.
Tell the team member to address the risk.
Overall explanation
Before acting, Quinten should refer to the risk register to determine the planned responses and the risk owner. The steering committee is not the best option as Quinten needs to first refer to the risk register to confirm the planned risk response or contingency plan. Telling the team member to address the risk without reviewing the risk register increases the probability the team member will apply the wrong solution. Quinten should consult the register before applying management reserves.

Lori is a team member on a large technical project for her organization. This project is on budget and schedule, but stakeholders are concerned that the decision-making process is too long and may result in the schedule slipping. At a recent team meeting, Lori's project manager informed her that she would be making some decisions around scheduling deliveries from vendors. Lori is confused and nervous about this new responsibility. She asks why she will have this authority and asks the project manager to explain. What is the project manager likely to say?
Stakeholders have lost confidence in the project manager's ability to manage the schedule.
Correct answer
The project team is closer to the work and will have a better idea of when deliveries are needed.
Lori is being punished for poor performance and needs more responsibilities.
The project manager will say they are shifting blame in case something goes wrong.
Overall explanation
The project team generally has the most up-to-date information on specific aspects of the project. Allowing them more control over some details will help mitigate the risk associated with communication delays. However, the project manager failed to explain the scenario to Lori and instill confidence in the responsibility. Shifting blame is not a good reason for this decision. This answer is an example of what to watch out for on your exam; never shift blame or set someone up for failure. Stakeholders have not lost confidence in the project manager; their concern is with the decision-making process, not the delivery of materials. Lori is not being punished. In contrast, this could be seen as a positive ask.

Erik is a project manager with over 20 years of experience in the civil engineering industry. His organization has traditionally required its project managers to conduct SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis of competing businesses to determine how their organization can stand out in the marketplace. However, after extensive research on case studies for their competitors, Erik realized that they are succeeding because they have adopted Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) principles. Which of the following is not a characteristic of IPD?
Unilateral effort.
Risks are managed collectively.
Correct answer
Allocate and transfer risk
Value-based team success
Overall explanation
Traditional projects differ from IPD because they perceive contracts as a unilateral effort where risks are allocated and transferred, and there is no sharing of the consequences. The remaining options are all characteristics of IPD teams. Risks are managed collectively by the team, and all associated risks are shared amongst the stakeholders. The compensation from the project's success is tied to value-based team success, where the project goals are established in the beginning stages. Agreements and contracts for IPD are multilateral, and the sharing of risks and information is transparent.

Peter is the project manager in a weak matrix organization. He is managing a project that is currently three weeks behind schedule. During a recent team meeting, Peter was notified that two project team members previously scheduled to work on the project would be reassigned to another project. The change in resources will result in further delays for Peter's project. What should Peter do to resolve this issue?
Correct answer
Speak with the resource's functional manager to understand why the resources are being removed.
Complain to the steering committee about this unfair change to the project team.
Determine which project tasks can be fast-tracked before the team members leave.
Ask the consulting project management office to keep the resources on his project.
Overall explanation
Speaking with the resources functional manager will allow Peter to understand why they are being moved and make a case for keeping them. The consulting project management office is not responsible for resource assignments, but they offer advice and support for the project manager. The steering committee is unlikely to be able to assist in this scenario, and the project manager should not complain to the committee but look for a solution. Fast-tracking is not ideal as the team members may not be able to complete the tasks being fast-tracked. Additionally, this answer choice is not ideal because the resources are still leaving the project team, and the project manager has not resolved the issue.

Barbara is the scrum master for Project W, which is eight iterations into deployment and over budget by $10,000. The project team has provided several main deliverables of Project W, but several stakeholders are agitated over cost overruns and are concerned Project W will fail. What should Barbara do to address their concerns?
Ask the steering committee for more funding.
Fast track as many tasks as possible.
Remove some expensive tasks from the project.
Correct answer
Remind the stakeholders about the value already provided.
Overall explanation
Barbara should point out to the stakeholders that Project W has already provided benefits to them and is at least partially successful. Fast-tracking tasks are not done in agile projects. Removing expensive tasks may reduce the budget but is not ideal as those tasks may be necessary. Asking for more funding is not the best idea.

The project owner has decided on the fountain style they would like in the middle of the courtyard. However, the architects all agree that the project owner's fountain does not work well with the rest of the design. How should Sam resolve this conflict?
Direct the architects to utilize the fountain selected by the project owner.
Correct answer
Call a meeting with the project owner and have the architects show the water fountain's alternate selections.
Select one of the new fountains proposed by the architects.
Allow the architects to select the best fountain for the courtyard.
Overall explanation
Calling a meeting with the project owner and allowing them to see the fountain's proposed changes is the best course of action. If the project owner approves the change, then the change control process should be followed, documented, and executed based on the project owner's decision. Directing the architects to utilize the fountain selected by the project owner is not the best choice as the project manager should offer alternatives to the fountain for the best design. Selecting one of the new fountains proposed by the architects does not gain approval from the project owner. Allowing the architects to select the best fountain for the courtyard does not gain approval from the project owner.

Juliette is hired as an agile coach on a project in a healthcare organization that is in the process of adopting agile methodology. It is a medium-sized organization where multiple short-term projects run in parallel. She notices high attrition within the organization, and as development team members join and leave, they take their knowledge along with them. As a result, when new developers join, they find it challenging to handle past business issues. The former knowledge employees utilized to troubleshoot bugs or take design-related decisions is unavailable. To better manage the knowledge and fill this skill gap, what is the best technique the agile coach can propose?
Correct answer
Pair programming
Divergence
Continuous integration
Test-driven development
Overall explanation
Pair programming essentially means that two people write code together on one machine. It is a collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. While a pair of developers work on a task together, they do not only write code they also plan and discuss their work. They clarify ideas, discuss approaches, and come to better solutions. This technique can also be applied to agile project teams with regard to knowledge management. This way, one developer who has faced a particular issue can educate their companion on how to best tackle and resolve it in the existing setting. Also, using pair alternation, the whole team can share information, as developers will hand over experiences to one another every time they alternate. Consequently, it surges corporate learning and retains business information. As a result, if any developer chooses to leave the project, the knowledge would be sustained with the other paired developer. Divergence means that the programmers will work separately and without interaction. Continuous integration is the concept of integrating the new code with the established code as the new code passes its test for acceptability. Test-driven development is the concept of writing the test and then writing the code to pass the test. This is an excellent approach to development, but it is not the best choice for this scenario because of the attrition rate and isolated knowledge.

David and his team expect that the planning work they do at the start of the project will change as the project progresses, and they will learn more about how to complete the project. In practice, this can be implemented by:
Repeating the full planning process once the first changes are requested.
Never estimating the date of a release, as you know, the project will change.
Asking for suggested changes from all team members at each regular meeting.
Correct answer
Expecting while planning that changes are coming, welcoming the changes when they come, and adjusting the plan accordingly.
Overall explanation
Changes should be expected, welcomed and should influence the plan when they happen. Nothing significant should occur when the first change is requested, as it all depends on the nature of the change. Changes do not imply that you should never estimate a release date. There is no need to ask for suggested changes at each meeting.

Monica is a project manager for the Beam Project, which depends upon the coordination of manufacturing directors, resources, the IT department, and the CIO. Some of the project goals are waste reduction, minimizing inventory, and forecasting resource utilization, so Monica will gather resources only as needed. What type of approach is Monica using?
Schedule ASAP
Resource recurring factoring
Schedule ALAP
Correct answer
Just-in-time manufacturing
Overall explanation
The correct response is just-in-time manufacturing. With this approach, physical resources are used only as they are needed. Just-in-time manufacturing also reduces waste, keeps inventory minimal, and helps the project manager better predict resource utilization. Schedule ASAP means to schedule the work to be done as soon as possible. Schedule ALAP means to schedule work to be done as late as possible against the project deadline. Resource recurring factoring is not a legitimate project management term.

During the past week, Ginny noticed that one of the team members was violating the ground rules for showing up on time for meetings. What should Ginny do next?
Inform the team member's manager about the rule violation.
Publicly call out the team member for violating the rules.
Correct answer
Privately remind the team member about the ground rules and ask if he has any related questions.
Do nothing. The teammates will reprimand the team member.
Overall explanation
It is likely this developer made a mistake and forgot a specific rule. Privately speaking with them and asking if they need anything clarified allows them to improve their behavior. Informing the developer's manager is not the best solution as it will not result in immediate behavior changes. Publicly calling out the developer for a mistake will damage Ginny's relationship with them and discourage the team from speaking up. The developers' teammates are unlikely to notice this error.

You are the project manager of a large, complex IT project for a hospital in your community. The project implementation will be installed by different departments in the hospital on specific dates so as not to impact patient care and reduce overall risk. One of your team members, Diana, reports that she and her family celebrate the Chinese New Year, which is in three months. Because of this, Diana wants to take vacation time for the celebration, and she will not be available during an implementation date that is mandatory as part of the project. At any other time, this would not be a concern, but she is needed during this time for the project work on the specific date mandated by the client. How do you handle this request as the project manager?
Deny Diana's request, citing the importance of her role in the project.
Correct answer
Find another resource for the project work and if one is capable and willing, have that person complete Diana's implementation.
Tell Diana that her cultural beliefs should not impact her work and that she is responsible for the organization.
Tell the customer that the project work will have to be delayed due to a cultural holiday.
Overall explanation
Tell Diana that her cultural beliefs should not impact her work and that she is responsible for the organization. By acknowledging Diana's cultural differences and allowing her to take time to celebrate them with her family, you are not only building an important cultural relationship, but you are also acknowledging the importance of diversity. To be a servant leader, you must show that all parts of your teams are important and should be considered while meeting crucial aspects of their backgrounds. You also encourage a level of mentoring and trust by allowing Diana to work with another team member to fill in while she is absent. In addition, the vacation time is three months away, so there should be plenty of time to find another resource and let Diana coach that person on the installation. Denying Diana's request is not a valid choice as there are three months until the installation date. If this request were short notice, this might be a more reasonable choice. Delaying the project for an event three months away is not feasible. Criticizing Diana's cultural beliefs is not acceptable behavior.

David is a project manager of an interactive web design project for a large retail chain. His team has a customer-approved color and font schematic to choose from, but one of the designers firmly believes that some color schematics are far from ideal for the project work. What method should David use to control change within a project to increase its likelihood of success?
Impose that all changes must go through the project manager to initiate change.
Freeze scope and allow absolutely no changes.
Allow his team ultimate control of changes, provided they are senior members and subject matter experts.
Correct answer
Have change requests evaluated through a formal change control process.
Overall explanation
Change control procedures vary from project to project. However, it is recommended that each change request be processed through a formal change control process. Changing the fonts and colors the customer has already approved will be a tricky change request, but the project manager can move the change through the change control process if there is a good reason to do so. The project manager should not initiate any project changes, but instead, the changes should be issued through a change control board. Project scopes should never be frozen, and some flexibility in changes must be allowed while project work is being performed. The project team should not initiate any project changes, but instead, the changes should be issued through a change control board.

Corey is the project manager for an online content creation team that creates and publishes new articles daily. The content's response has been outstanding so far, so good that Corey's client is requesting additional content. Corey's agency has hired freelancers to meet the increased demand for content, but Corey and his client have noticed a significant amount of typos in the material that the freelancers are submitting. Additionally, the style has started to vary since so many new people are working on the project, and they are not familiar with the writing the client prefers. Corey creates a style guide, hires several freelance editors to review the freelancers' work, and assigns each freelancer to work with one of his senior team members. As a result, the writing style begins to sound more uniform, and the grammar improves. How can the project manager verify the team's performance improvements?
Correct answer
Improved quality
Improved customer satisfaction
Reduced risk of failure
Reduced time to market
Overall explanation
The quality of the work has improved. An empirical analysis of the work will reveal that the number of typos has decreased, and a qualitative review of the work will show that the style is more representative of what the clients have come to expect. Time to market is not affected by these performance improvements. You can still be on time with the quality improvements – or even on time with defects in the project work. There will be a reduced risk of failure, but there was no concern that the project would fail in the first place. Customers will be more satisfied, but the primary concern, in this case, was the client.

You will be relying on subject matter experts and specialists within your organization to implement the various activities. Due to security requirements, you cannot outsource any portion of the project. The project also requires your team to complete as many sites as quickly as possible to achieve the corporate monthly targets. Knowing that you are sharing resources with another department, working with a non-dedicated team, and have a large geographical area to service, how would you strategize your deployment plan?
Waterfall planning
Inactive planning, based on the present performance
Reactive planning, based on past performance
Correct answer
Rolling wave planning
Overall explanation
Rolling-wave planning is most suitable in this case, as you have limited and shared resources. With this method, your project will have higher chances of success as the team will perform highly detailed short-term plans for specific geographical regions. The team will be completing portions of the upgrade, while high-level planning will take place for other regions simultaneously. Waterfall planning plans the entire project before project execution and assumes the triple constraints of time, cost, and scope are fixed. Reactive planning is not a valid planning technique.

Calculate the project costs with the additional change.
Hire additional project team members to complete the project on time.
Complete a risk assessment on the proposed change.

Overall explanation
Once the scope has been modified, as in this instance, the project manager and the project team should reflect the scope addition in the scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. Although crashing the project may be appropriate in some instances, this question acknowledges additional time for the added work.

This product deliverable was flagged previously for the same flaw, and you know that a change request was submitted and approved to correct the deliverable. Now, as the project manager, you must discover why the change request was never executed. What analysis could help you in the future to be able to identify a breakdown in execution?
Trend analysis
Project scope decomposition
Correct answer
Root cause analysis
Earned value analysis
Overall explanation
By determining the main reasons that there was a defect in the deliverable and why the team failed to execute the change request, the project manager can avoid the deviation to achieve future projects' objectives. Trend analysis examines trends over time, not the causal factor for a defect. Earned value analysis examines how the project is performing on time and cost.

You are a project management consultant for a large, international manufacturer. They are considering shifting to remote teams throughout the globe so people can work from home, but they have some concerns about the configuration and management of these remote teams. In which situation is a virtual team necessary for a project?
A Mexican manufacturing plant is purchasing raw materials from Brazil.
An American company is manufacturing products that will be sold in Asia.
Correct answer
A niche software development project by a Spanish team requires specific development by a full-time developer in Croatia.
A multinational corporation is sponsoring a project with all stakeholders in the office headquarters.
Overall explanation
A virtual team has team members spread apart, not sharing a workspace. The developer is located in Croatia, while the other team members are located in Spain, which means this team is virtual. The American company selling products in Asia does not imply a virtual team, rather just that their market is in another country. A Mexican manufacturing plant purchasing raw materials from Brazil is also not an example of a virtual team because the Brazilian material provider is not a project team member. The multinational corporation's project is contained in the office headquarters, meaning the team members are collocated. Therefore, this is not a virtual team.

An escalation path and contingency plan is a critical part of a successful delivery plan. Identifying risk responses is an input to the escalation plan, captured in the team's planning stages. The backup plans and alternatives to various scenarios are put into place to mitigate risk in unforeseen circumstances. The communication plan defines how project communication is performed during the project and includes the communication tools.

You are a project manager responsible for the success of a $6,000,000 project. Your team's technical lead identifies a potential risk in one step of the production workflow with a low probability but high impact. What would be an example of risk mitigation?
Do nothing, as the probability of this occurrence is low.
Cancel this step of the production workflow and proceed along with the project without this work.
Correct answer
Discuss risk triggers with the team and strategize to develop a workaround should this issue present itself.
Outsource this step of the production workflow to a contracted group.
Overall explanation
To mitigate the risk, you should address risk triggers with the team. Risk mitigation means that you try to get ahead of the risk, not avoid, accept, or transfer it. Canceling this step of the workflow would avoid the risk, not mitigate it. Outsourcing this step of the workflow would be transferring the risk, not mitigating it. Transference is most often used where there is a certainty the risk is going to happen. Doing nothing would be accepting the risk, not mitigating it.

Continual improvement emerges from a cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting (PDCA) as a way of iteratively improving quality. Customer satisfaction involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer needs.

When they leave, the team members never accuse Christopher of abuse or inappropriate behavior. They simply state that they feel disconnected from him and a bit overworked and unacknowledged. What general skills can Christopher work on to reverse this trend?
Agile methodology
Nothing, as his projects are getting done.
Bedside manner
Correct answer
Emotional Intelligence
Overall explanation
Christopher seems to be a very efficient project manager, but he needs to work on his emotional intelligence. An emotionally intelligent project manager knows that people are not machines and will seek to understand and utilize them to drive people. While he could stick with his current method, he may get his projects done, but he will continuously replace frustrated team members. Bedside manner is a euphemism for being more personable, and Christopher could use this, but a general increase in emotional intelligence is his main issue. Agile methodology alone cannot help as there are underlying changes that need to be changed and Christopher needs to work on his emotional intelligence.

Mindy is the scrum master for Project L, which is in its fifth iteration and has a velocity of 97 story points. After the last sprint review, a stakeholder let her know that one information radiator seems outdated. What should Mindy do?
Refer the stakeholder to the weekly reports.
Correct answer
Ask a team member to investigate the information radiator.
Do nothing. Information radiators are, by definition, accurate.
Invite the stakeholder to daily standups.
Overall explanation
Mindy should determine if that radiator is updated correctly and take appropriate action. Referring the stakeholder to other reports is not ideal as the radiator may be broken. Inviting the stakeholder to daily standups will not fix the radiator. Information radiators are not, by definition, accurate.

Creating the work breakdown structure is a cornerstone of a predictive project and you have completed many of these in your time as a project manager. You are having lunch with a colleague when the topic of team building comes up. Your colleague states that WBS creation is a team-building activity. What is your response?
This is not true; creating a WBS is done solely by the project manager.
Correct answer
This is true; creating a WBS is engaging and collaborative for team members.
This is true; creating a WBS allows for role definition and team composition to be finalized.
This is not true; creating a WBS is done before a team is formed.
Overall explanation
Creating a WBS is an excellent team-building activity as it is engaging and collaborative in nature. The project team should do the WBS, never solely the project manager. The WBS is not created before the team is formed – the team is assigned to the project, then the WBS is created during the planning activities of the project. The WBS does not finalize a team's composition, nor does it provide role definition. While the team composition may change, the WBS should always be completed by the project team members.

Amy’s team has gone through several sprints as part of their project to assemble a web application for tracking the food in a family’s refrigerator. While her team is making progress, they are getting stuck on several features. Specifically, the feature that links a generic grocery item to a list of specific brands requires extensive troubleshooting, so much so that other features are starting to fall behind schedule. Amy recognizes this because she tracks her team’s velocity, which measures how many features the team finishes during a given sprint. Velocity has been steady over time, but it recently fell off steeply. Which process group is being integrated into the adaptive planning environment?
Initiating process group
Executing process group
Planning process group
Correct answer
Monitoring and controlling process group
Overall explanation
Monitoring and controlling processes include tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project. Initiating processes are performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project, including obtaining authorization to start or phase. Planning processes are required to establish the project’s scope, refine objectives, and define the course of action needed to accomplish the project’s objectives. Executing processes are performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project requirements.

Jon is the scrum master for Project CAD, intended to revamp a company's website with catalog and purchasing service, chat functionality, and other new features. During a planning session for the project, Jon is asked to offer a ROM estimate. What is the best place for information to help Jon with this task?
Consult with other scrum masters he knows.
Ask his project team about other projects they have worked on together.
He cannot, because as an agile project, the budget and scope frequently change.
Correct answer
Examine the set of requirements offered by the product owner.
Overall explanation
Agile projects have a set budget and schedule and flexible scope. A ROM budget can be created from the product owner requirements that have been identified so far. John might also rely on older projects as historical information, but a ROM budget is a rough order of magnitude and can be unreliable as the project moves forward. Asking the project team is not ideal as the projects they have worked on may not be similar to Project CAD. Consulting with other scrum masters is not ideal as the projects they have worked on may not be similar to Project CAD. While agile projects are intended to be flexible, it is still possible to put together a rough budget based on historical information and the project's current objectives.

During a recent sprint planning session, it was discovered that several user stories could not be implemented as critical infrastructure is missing. What should Helen do next?
Speak with the product owner about deprioritizing those stories.
Remove those stories from Project S.
Do nothing. The project team will figure it out.
Correct answer
Determine what is missing and add appropriate tasks to the backlog.
Overall explanation
Helen should determine what dependencies are missing and then add appropriate tasks to develop those capabilities. She should also adjust the stories' place in the roadmap to ensure the dependencies go live in time. Removing stories is not ideal as this will change what Project S delivers. The product owner is unlikely able to help as the dependencies are not available. Doing nothing does not address the problem. Doing nothing is often the worst thing you can do.

As a project manager, Juan's latest project is the creation of a new manufacturing assembly line that will allow his company, Little Manufacturing, to make their product with less downtime and faster turnaround time. A stakeholder has submitted a change request, which will most likely result in a cost and time increase for the project. Except for one, all of the following components are not part of the change control system. Which one of the following selections is part of the change control system?
Project documentation and how the manufacturing assembly should work.
Correct answer
The creation of tracking systems for the requested change.
Transferring risk by outsourcing parts of the project execution.
To get the project done quicker, add more team members.
Overall explanation
The creation of a tracking system for the requested change is the correct answer because it describes a component of the change control system. The project documentation and how the manufacturing assembly should work are incorrect because this process should already be included in the product description in the project management plan. It also is not part of the change control system. Adding team members to speed up the project's completion is called crashing and is not part of the change control system. Transferring risk by outsourcing parts of the project work is called transference. This is an incorrect response because it is not a value-added change and not part of the change control system.

Recently, Hank heard that several stakeholders disagree over how to continue with this project. What should Hank do next?
Wait until the next stakeholder meeting before saying anything.
Make the team members poll the stakeholders for their opinions.
Ask the project team for help in combating the disagreement.
Correct answer
Meet with each stakeholder to understand the reason for the disagreement.
Overall explanation
Hank should meet with each stakeholder to understand what the disagreement is about and search for common ground. It is best to confront a problem, not the people, and collaborate on an excellent solution. Waiting until the next meeting risks the disagreement intensifying and may embarrass the stakeholders in front of others. Having team members poll stakeholders is non-ideal, as Hank should be responsible for this action. Additionally, a poll does not address the issue but gathers information. Asking the project team for help is beyond their responsibilities and may create a rift among the project team and the stakeholders.

Compromising with all parties so that everyone receives a feature they want.
Assistance with creating a shared understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements.
Evaluating the amount of documentation required, so teams are spending more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation.
Working with the R&D department to review the required documentation.

Compromising usually involves parties agreeing to give up a feature they want, which results in a 'lose-lose' situation. Working with the R&D department to review the required documentation is something you and the team would work together to accomplish. You and the team would work together with the R&D department to create a shared understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements.

Determine dependencies
Resource assignments
Bottom-up estimating

Before Odette can determine when any given task occurs, she will need to determine the tasks' dependencies. To determine when an activity in the project would be complete, the project manager must determine what activities precede the activity. The activity in question is dependent on the prior activities being completed. Bottom-up estimating will provide an accurate budget estimate.

What has management succumbed to in this scenario?
Parkinson's Law
Moore's Law
Cognitive Reward Theory

Management has made the assumption that because Anna is good at application development, she would also be good at managing application development projects. This is called the Halo Effect as there is a "halo" around Anna and software development. Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it.

Ted is a project manager on Project DCX. Despite having several expert engineers on the project, the project team is still unfamiliar with some of the new tools. Due to this knowledge gap, Ted has allocated a budget and time for training the team on these tools. During a planning session, a stakeholder tells Ted that the training funds would be better spent elsewhere and that they should be re-allocated. What should Ted do next?
Negotiate with the stakeholder for less training funds or other training options.
Correct answer
Explain the importance of training and how the project's success is linked to it.
Tell the stakeholder that as the project manager Ted has control over the budget.
Accommodate the stakeholder and move the funds.
Overall explanation
Ensuring that everyone is aware of the skills gap and the solution is important to this project's success. Tying a successful launch to the training would help Ted acquire the necessary support. Moving the funds to accommodate the stakeholder will present a risk that the project will not proceed as intended.

The best option is to determine if others in the organization can help your team learn the new software by providing a demo or training session. Executive leadership would not be the best resource to ask for training videos. Training is always a good idea, but it is not the best choice presented in this scenario.

She approaches you because she does not know how to begin the mentorship process. What would you tell her?
Tell each project team members' supervisor to continue training their reports.
Register the project team to attend an industry conference.
Correct answer
Conduct 360-degree assessments of team members.
Wait for a team member to approach you who asks to be mentored.
Overall explanation
The most effective first step in mentorship is to conduct a 360-degree assessment, which allows each individual to assess their strengths and weaknesses. Katelyn can then use this information to determine where mentorship would be the most impactful. Katelyn should not wait for a team member to approach her and ask for mentorship. Often, people are not aware of their weaknesses and would therefore not know to ask for any mentorship. While industry conferences can be very enlightening, enrolling your team members as conference attendees are not mentorship. Katelyn should not direct supervisors to provide more training for multiple reasons. The supervisors may not act on Katelyn's request or may not provide training to team members. Additionally, it is essential to understand the difference between training and mentorship. Training usually results in a new skillset, mentorship results in career clarity and confidence.

You are the project manager of a large project in your organization. Many of the stakeholders are concerned about the project's success, and they often ask you for updates and status on the project. You are responsible for prioritizing project risks. The risks should be prioritized to correspond to their expected monetary value, where the risk with the highest expected monetary value is the highest priority. Which risk is the lowest priority?
A risk with a 2 percent probability of costing the organization $3,000,000.00.
Correct answer
A risk with a 25 percent probability of costing the organization $100,000.00.
A risk with a 10 percent probability of costing the organization $700,000.00.
A risk with a 30 percent probability of costing the organization $109,000.00.
Overall explanation
The expected monetary value is calculated by multiplying the probability by the impact. The option with a 25 percent probability has an expected monetary value of $25,000.00 making it the risk with the lowest priority. The option with a 30 percent chance of occurring has an expected monetary value of $32,700.00. The risk with 10 percent of happening has an expected monetary value of $70,000.00. Therefore, the risk with a 10 percent chance of occurrence should be the highest priority due to the highest expected monetary value. The risk with a 2 percent chance of occurrence has an expected monetary value of $60,000.00.

Pablo is a project manager working in a functional organization. Pablo manages a small project team that is installing new software throughout the organization. The project team is experiencing long communication delays from the other departments when they are trying to schedule work to install the software. The team reports that they often send multiple requests before getting a curt or vague response. As Pablo tries to coach the team and resolve the issue, he needs to know the primary blocker to overcome. What is the primary blocker he is experiencing in this scenario?
Correct answer
Project team authority
Red tape
He should get his project sponsor involved.
Rudeness
Overall explanation
It appears that Pablo's team is not viewed as having the authority to get answers or requests answered. In a functional organization, the project manager has low authority over the project team. Other departments may not recognize or respond to requests to interact with people not within their team or line of business. He has several paths to remedy that, but he must first recognize the obstacle to combat it. While ignoring requests or taking too long to respond is rude, lack of authority is the root cause problem. Pablo should get his sponsor involved at some point, but that may be the solution to the problem, not the root cause of the problem in the scenario. Red tape is an idiom referring to regulations or conformity to formal rules or standards which are claimed to be excessive, rigid or redundant, or to bureaucracy claimed to hinder or prevent action or decision-making, which is not the case here, as the team gets ignored altogether.

Push communication
Interactive communication
Correct answer
Pull communication
Verbal communication
Overall explanation
This is an example of pull communication. Pull communication refers to the sender putting the information in a central location that the receivers must be responsible for accessing. This is not push communication because the sender is not pushing the documentation out to the team; the team must access it independently. This is not an example of interactive feedback because there is no communication evidence from the project manager and the team members.

Recently Brenda has engaged with a vendor to support several upcoming features, and she has opted for a cost-plus incentive fee contract. To help control costs, what specific steps should Brenda take with this contract?
Closely monitor the materials used by the vendor.
Ensure the vendor has sufficient ramp-up time.
Correct answer
Clearly defined phases tied to the incentives.
Instruct the vendor only to purchase materials from one provider.
Overall explanation
Clearly defining phases and how the incentive fee is tied to those phases will help Brenda set clear expectations and control costs with this vendor. Ramp-up time will not impact the fees for this contract. There may be a learning curve for the vendor, but Brenda should help the vendor "ramp up" before they begin work on the project. While Brenda should be aware of the materials used, they will likely not be the most important aspect of this contract. Generally, the project manager will not be able to dictate where the vendors obtain their materials.

One notes that their teams tend to use conference calls to catch up on each other's lives instead of accomplishing work. The other observes that her team can usually work autonomously if she provides a few written tasks at the beginning of the workday. After conversing, the project managers discover that their teams share these and other traits. Which alternative should the project managers explore for virtual team member engagement?
A shared portal
Video conferencing
Audio conferencing
Correct answer
Email/chat
Overall explanation
Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update many people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members. They are effective for distributing work quickly and offer limited opportunities for collaboration. A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. However, such repositories are mainly useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Video conferencing is a critical technique for virtual teams. However, it is most helpful to demonstrate visual components or make contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication. Audio conferencing is more appropriate for sharing nuances that are not necessarily included in written communication.

Your development team has been working through the first four sprints of the project. They have successfully released the deliverable after each sprint. During the fifth sprint review meeting, one of the stakeholders stated that they were unsatisfied with the progress and advised the product owner that their most recent business requirement was missing from the product increment. What likely happened during the sprint planning meeting?
Correct answer
The product backlog was not reprioritized.
The stakeholder register was not up to date.
The scrum master failed to identify priority.
The sprint backlog was not prioritized.
Overall explanation
The development team sets sprint goals based on the product backlog, and it is up to the product owner to ensure it is prioritized. Given that the first four sprints successfully delivered a product increment, it is most likely that the product owner did not reprioritize the backlog with the stakeholders' changing requirements. The sprint backlog identifies the activities the project team will perform during the sprint. There is no information in the question that suggests that the stakeholder register was not updated.

You are the project manager of the JSS Project for your organization. This project is a manufacturing project utilizing new materials in your industry. This new material is expensive, and the project sponsor is concerned about cost as the team learns how to work with the new material. It is apparent that the cost has been identified as the highest priority on the project. Although cost is a crucial factor, the team must be confident and skilled in completing the work. So, you recommend on-the-job training for the team to collectively learn how to work with the materials they will be using in the project. This on-the-job training is considered which of the following?
Overhead costs
Variable costs
Correct answer
Cost of quality
Cost of non-conformance
Overall explanation
Training is an example of the cost of quality, sometimes called the cost of conformance to quality. The team will need to learn how to work with the material, and this will create an expense, but the expense could be far greater if the team does not learn how to work with the materials. The cost of non-conformance is the expense generated from not training the team, including the potential defects, mistakes, and frustration within the team. Overhead costs describe the costs of doing business. While you might argue that training is an overhead cost, the best answer is the cost of quality as this is project-specific work. Variable costs describe the costs that vary, such as travel expenses.

Overall explanation
Hannah should refer to the project's documented change control process, which will guide her in her next steps. The added work may need to flow through the change control process. Depending on the work, additional planning may be needed. The steering committee is unlikely to be able to assist. It is the project manager's responsibility to manage these types of scenarios. Fast-tracking allows tasks and/or phases to overlap but increases project risks. There is no evidence given that these tasks could overlap, so the best answer is to first refer to the change control process for the project.

Stakeholders are a bit anxious about the project, but Doug assures stakeholders that the project is going well. Doug wants to ensure that his stakeholders always reference the most up-to-date project artifacts as part of this project. To accomplish this, he has documented version controls and policies for project documents and artifacts. Where would Doug note this information?
Correct answer
Configuration management plan
Requirements Management plan
Lessons learned document
Issue Log
Overall explanation
Doug should note this in the configuration management plan. The purpose of the configuration management plan is to establish policies and procedures around naming conventions and versioning control. Neither the lessons learned document, requirements management plan, nor the issue log set the standard for version control or naming conventions. Lessons learned documents detail what has worked, or has not worked, in the project. The requirements management plan addresses the requirements elicitation and control. The issue log is where issues and their project status are tracked.

Katherine is the project manager for the SDQ Project, which is eight weeks into a planned twenty-week lifecycle and is $5,000 over a $150,000 budget. Recently a stakeholder asked Katherine why she spends so much time documenting lessons learned. What is Katherine's most likely response?
Her project team is new, so they have a lot to learn.
Correct answer
Lessons learned will help the current project, and other projects avoid pitfalls.
Lessons learned can be sold to recoup project expenses.
Part of predictive project management is to record lessons learned.
Overall explanation
Documenting lessons learned is critical to a project as it allows the team to learn from mistakes and improve. Selling lessons learned is not the best answer and is likely not possible. Part of predictive management is recording lessons learned, but this is not the best answer presented. Every project team has a lot to learn, regardless of it being new or not.

Jane is a project manager who utilizes an abundance of project management leadership styles to accomplish her tasks. While her default style is servant leadership, she can be directive or autocratic when the situation calls for it. She is currently faced with an important decision that will affect her project team's future, and she is concerned about the change and how best to manage the issue with her team. She is hearing multiple opinions from inside the project team and does not know how to proceed. What kind of decision-making could she embrace in this situation?
Laissez-Faire - she should let the team decide organically.
Random choice – let fate decide.
Authoritative - she should tell the team what to do.
Correct answer
Consensus - she should listen to all viewpoints.
Overall explanation
While there are times to embrace an authoritative style or let things happen organically, this appears to be a controversial and important decision. No matter what is decided, it is likely that someone will be disappointed or unhappy. In this instance, listening to all voices and working towards a consensus decision is best. When we need to make big decisions that affect the project team's future, we should not be imposing our view on the team. The team may not be able to decide organically, as they may not have the full picture in front of them. Deciding randomly is never a good choice for critical decisions.

Eugene is the project manager for the Orange Project, which is in its planning stage. The organization is a matrix structure and Eugene has authority over the project team. His project team has informed him they require several pieces of equipment currently being used by other projects at their company. What should Eugene do?
Purchase additional pieces of equipment.
Submit a purchase order to the teams using the equipment.
Correct answer
Meet with the other teams to negotiate a time to use the equipment.
Develop a project calendar for resource utilization.
Overall explanation
Eugene should meet with the other project managers to share the necessary equipment. In a matrix structure, it is common for teams to share resources, such as equipment and people, among the projects. A purchase order authorizes the purchase of a good or service and likely is not needed. The best option is to work with the other project managers to share the resources. Purchasing additional equipment may not be necessary if it may be shared. Developing a project calendar is not the best choice. A project calendar identifies when the project work will take place, such as Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. A resource calendar identifies when resources are available.

At Petoskey General Contracting, Norah is overseeing the implementation of a new computer system. She is currently working on the identification of stakeholders, internal and external, who have an interest in her project. These stakeholders can have a positive or negative impact on Norah's project. Through the identification of stakeholders, Norah realizes that stakeholder identification is what?
Should not be completed in any phase of the project.
The project sponsor's responsibility.
Correct answer
To be completed throughout the lifecycle of the project.
Only for stakeholders who will give positive contributions to the project.
Overall explanation
Stakeholder identification occurs throughout a project's lifecycle. As the project moves through different phases, sometimes additional stakeholders become involved while others are let go. Identifying stakeholders is not only the project sponsor's responsibility as it is the responsibility of the project management team. The project charter may identify some stakeholders, but the project management team is who primarily identifies stakeholders. Identifying stakeholders is a process that must be completed and is conducted throughout the project's lifecycle. Sometimes, stakeholders consist of people and organizations who will be directly affected, negatively or positively, by the project's outcome.

To best exhibit the agile approach to documentation, William chose to discuss work assignments with the team instead of taking the time to put documentation in writing. No one directly asked for written requirements. What is the best way to characterize William’s approach?
William should write some requirements, but only for the more complicated work assignments.
William is correctly demonstrating the agile approach to documentation, as no one asked for requirements in writing.
William is correctly demonstrating the agile approach to documentation, as it is not required.
Correct answer
William should begin completing some documentation in writing, as taking an agile approach to documentation does not imply that documentation should not be completed at all.
Overall explanation
The agile approach to documentation is focused on minimal documentation, not no documentation. William is not demonstrating a correct approach; no one needs to ask for the requirements in writing. William would not be correct if he only completed some requirements and not others. All items should have requirements, although the documentation should be minimal.

Paola is the project manager for a project at Bank Corporation. While reviewing a set of project reports, she notices that several processes are out of control. Paola performs an analysis and creates a chart to show the stability of the processes. What should Paola do next?
Correct answer
Refer to her established escalation paths for the processes analyzed in the control chart.
Escalate the out-of-control processes and Pareto chart to her steering committee.
Assign a project team member to investigate the control chart.
Consult with her project management office regarding the bubble chart she has created.
Overall explanation
Paola should refer to her documented escalation paths. This will ensure she is complying with project governance. A control chart shows the stability of a process over time. The steering committee is unlikely to assist, and a Pareto chart shows categories of failures in quality control. Assigning a project team member to investigate the control chart does not help resolve the issues Paolo has already defined. Consulting with the project management office with a bubble chart is not the best choice. A bubble chart shows the size and characteristics of a risk event, not the stability of the processes.

Jacob is the project manager for his organization and he is leading a project with a budget of $650,000 and a strict deadline of six months. Jacob is leading a virtual project team, though the team members work in different districts of the same city. Some team members have worked together for years, but most team members have never worked together before this project. After two virtual meetings, Jacob notices that not all team members have been active in providing their ideas for the project. What alternative can Jacob suggest to build relationships and foster trust between team members?
Agree on a shared language.
Commit to a team charter.
Correct answer
Getting the team together physically early-on.
Clarify tasks and processes, not just goals and roles.
Overall explanation
Jacob should suggest that the team meet a few times physically, as they are all physically located in the same city. Face-to-face communication is almost always better than virtual meetings when it comes to building relationships and fostering trust. Team members should get to know each other better, personally and professionally, and create a shared vision and a set of guiding principles for how the team will work. Clarify tasks and processes, not just goals and roles, is ideal for any project, but the problem in this question centers on effective communication, trust, and teamwork. A team charter is needed in agile projects, but there is little evidence this is an agile project. In addition, a charter is not going to foster the needed trust and transparency the team needs to feel able to communicate with one another. Agreeing on a shared language is not a viable solution as the team likely all speak the same language as they live in the same city. While the project team may have members who do not speak the same language, the question does not imply this to be the case.

Larry is the project manager for an infrastructure project three weeks into implementation, one week behind schedule, and has ten weeks of implementation left. To help get the project back on schedule, the organization has approved Larry hiring a vendor to complete some of the tasks. After receiving some quotes, Larry has decided to hire a contractor for the work, but the contract process takes a few weeks in the organization. Larry sent a communication to the vendor letting them know the organization was willing to hire them for the work. What best represents this communication?
Purchase order
Statement of work
Correct answer
Letter of intent
Contract
Overall explanation
A letter of intent is not a contract but is a letter indicating the buyer intends to engage with the seller. A purchase order is a document formally authorizing the purchase of goods or services. A purchase order is sometimes called a unilateral contract. The statement of work describes all of the work the buyer would like the vendor to complete as part of the quote, bid, or proposal. A contract is a legally binding document for the exchange of goods or services and, in this scenario, will come from centralized contracting within the organization, not from the project manager.

The best example of the agile concepts of barely sufficient and just in time documentation is:
Documentation that is completed in an outline form that is done just before the deadline in the planning phase.
Documentation that includes only titles for all user stories unless the developer asks for more, produced during the daily scrum each morning.
Correct answer
Documentation that is as minimal as possible to cover basic needs, that is done only right before it is needed and not before.
Documentation that is less than four paragraphs per user story and that is completed two days before the developer begins.
Overall explanation
Barely sufficient documentation is focused on providing the least amount of information to get work estimated and complete. Just-in-time documentation is produced at the latest time possible without a negative impact on the team. Documentation that is completed in an outline form is not required for this documentation concept. Documentation that includes only titles is not required for this documentation concept.

Paul is the project manager for a software development project which is in its planning stages. The steering committee has asked him to put together a project team for the project. Paul is instructed first to utilize resources that are full-time employees, and then they can discuss contracting labor if needed. What information will be most beneficial to help Paul accomplish this?
Correct answer
Project's scope statement
List of available resources
Procurement guidelines
Project budget
Overall explanation
The project scope statement will help Paul determine the type of resources needed on the project team. The scope statement is a fundamental tool, even at a high level, to identify and build the initial project team. As more information becomes available, additional resources can be added. A list of available resources does not really identify the specific resources needed for the project, so this choice is incorrect. The project's budget is not the best choice for identifying the type of resources needed to do the project work, so this choice is incorrect. The procurement guidelines are not needed at this point of the project planning as Paul needs to identify internal resources first.

Mike is a developer on a project for the Steel Company and has several serious concerns about the project. When he tells the project manager about these concerns, the project manager tells Mike to stop worrying and focus on his job but does nothing to address Mike's concerns. What should Mike do next?
Stop worrying and focus on his job.
Correct answer
Escalate his concerns to the steering committee.
Complain to the project manager's boss.
Tell his team about his concerns.
Overall explanation
If Mike's concerns are legitimate and the project manager is unwilling to help, he should continue escalating them until they are addressed. Ignoring these concerns is not a good idea as they may put the project at risk. Telling his team may not be sufficient to escalate those concerns. Complaining to the project manager's boss may not help address his concerns. Complaining is never a good choice, but escalating a concern may be appropriate in some scenarios.

Stakeholders must attend all sprint reviews.
They are attending in case their deliverables need rework.
The project is almost over, so they want to see how it ends.
Correct answer
Those stakeholders may benefit from other aspects of Project O.
Overall explanation
These stakeholders are most likely still attending sprint reviews to see what else they may benefit from in the project, as other deliverables may help them as well.

Which of the following is not a reason to include the project manager in contract negotiation?
The project manager can prevent future contract changes by responding to bidders' questions upfront.
Correct answer
The project manager can write the contract.
The project manager represents the best interests of both the buyer and the seller.
The project manager can help vet the sellers' abilities to deliver the project's deliverables successfully.
Overall explanation
The project manager should not write the contract between a buyer and a seller. The procurement office is responsible for writing a contract. The project manager should be present in the negotiation stage to protect both the buyer's and the seller's best interests. The project manager should be present to answer any of the bidders' questions about the project. If the project manager can initially address these questions, it will prevent future contract changes. The project manager can also attest to a seller's suitability and skillset.

You are the project manager for a software development project, and you will be utilizing some contracted resources for the work. This software development project requires continuity across the project work. Marvin has been a contractor on your project for one year and his contract is about to expire. His work is imperative to the project, and he has indicated that he would like to continue working with you on this project. What should you do next?
Let Marvin's contract lapse and hire a new contractor.
Hire Marvin as a full-time employee.
Issue a sole source contract with Marvin.
Correct answer
Issue a single source contract with Marvin.
Overall explanation
Because continuity is essential to this work, you should issue a single source contract to Marvin as he will be considered as a preferred vendor. You would not issue a sole source contract in the described case as Marvin is not the only available software developer. You should not let Marvin's contract lapse and hire someone else, as this will not bring the required continuity to the project.

In a recent survey, stakeholders for your organization have stated they are not satisfied with the methods on which the roads are designed and built. Which of the following is not a concern from investors for your organization?
Lack of a visible endpoint
Continual requests for involvement
Correct answer
Resistance to changes forced upon them by "management"
Apparent lack of control
Overall explanation
Supporting groups are not concerned about resistance to changes forced upon them by "management" as they are not company employees. Apparent lack of control is a likely concern for the stakeholders in this scenario. The tax dollars and compliance concerns affect them, and they likely want more input to the projects. Continual requests for involvement are a concern when stakeholders feel ignored or not communicated with effectively. Lack of a visible endpoint is a concern for stakeholders of your projects.

To accomplish this, Beth established a social media site and began sharing information. After a few days, she was asked by the organization's IT department to take the social media site down. What could have happened?
Correct answer
Beth did not consult with the IT department.

The best choice is that Beth likely did not consult with the IT department before establishing the social media site and was more than likely in violation of an established policy. Always check the organization's policies regarding social media usage before launching a social media site intended for business use. While it is possible that some private information was leaked, it is more likely that Beth did not have permission to create a social media site for the organization. Beth using the wrong social media site is not the best choice as it is more likely this violated an IT policy for the organization.

Greg is a veteran project manager who recently joined a company with a reputation for its management being rigid and firm. The management directs, and the employees respond. There is little room for discussion or suggestions in the culture. This has created an environment where people do not take the initiative and only work when they are told exactly what to do. The new CEO recently took over, and he endeavors to reverse this trend in the culture. The new CEO wants more openness and for his employees to feel valued. Greg is on board with the culture change, but it is deeply ingrained in the employees who have been in the organization prior to his start. When he tries to engage his project team, they are withdrawn and want to be told what to do. Greg is determined to reverse this "just do what you are told" dynamic. What management style are Greg and the new CEO attempting to change?
Autosynchronous
Servant leadership
Correct answer
Directing
Laissez-Faire
Overall explanation
The organization has created an environment where its employees are used to the directing management style. Greg wants a more dynamic project team that can think independently, so he shows them other leadership styles to change this in time. Autosynchronous is not a valid project management term – fictional term. Autocratic could describe this environment, but autosynchronous does not.

He has noticed that Jared, one of the new team members, has been staying late to complete tasks. Ben reviews the work performance reports and determines that Jared starts the tasks on time, but it takes longer for him to complete them. Based upon the information in the work performance reports, Ben should:
Talk with Jared to determine why he is unable to complete the tasks on time.
Assume Jared needs help and should ask for more resources.
Correct answer
Review the tasks with Jared and determine if they are a match for Jared's skillset.
Assign some of the tasks that Jared is working on to another team member that is not overloaded.
Overall explanation
A review of the tasks assigned to Jared and a review of Jared's skill set are needed to determine further if the tasks are assigned to the right person. If it is determined that the tasks are assigned to the right person, it would be good to talk with Jared and determine why he cannot complete the tasks. However, since the tasks may be misaligned, it may be better first to restructure the assignment of tasks to a matched skillset. Ben should not assume Jared needs help but should first determine if Jared has the needed skillset. Assigning some of the tasks to other team members is not the best solution as it may be that Jared does not have the required skills to complete the tasks. Talking with Jared to determine why he is unable to complete the tasks on time is a good second choice for this question, but Ben should first work with Jared to review the tasks and see if the work is a good match for Jared's skills.

As the project manager for a team of mostly self-taught software developers using agile methods to deploy updates to proprietary software, Jill can typically provide the minimum viable product on time. However, there is almost always a debilitating bug discovered shortly after a release. This escaped defect happens even though the team is not pressed for time, has a good rapport with the stakeholders, and is very familiar with the software's use cases. Since the software is used internally by a small group of experienced users, the bugs are quickly identified and diagnosed, but work that relies on the software is often delayed. Jill has tried to protect her team member's time as much as possible by canceling meetings and taking some of her team's assignments, but her team continues to deliver careless work. Jill thinks that her team needs additional training. On which competency should the team training focus?
Managing risk
Managing cost
Managing stakeholders
Correct answer
Managing quality
Overall explanation
Among other things, managing quality entails creating a system of checks to ensure that a minimum viable product is actually viable. The sloppy nature of the team's work suggests that there is a disconnect between what is expected and what is produced. Escaped defects are defects that make it all the way to production, as in this case, add a cost of poor quality. Managing risk is appropriate for preventing surprises, but there are unlikely to be many in this case. Managing cost is not the key issue of concern with the escaped defect. The team is on good terms with the stakeholders, so training to manage them is also unlikely to prevent the issue.

Larry is the project manager for Project Q, which is in its ninth week of implementation, is $5,000 over budget, and has a total budget of $100,000. Recently a team member let Larry know a critical task had somehow been missed during planning for Project Q. What should Larry do next?
Do nothing. Only planned tasks may be worked on in a project.
Bring up the task at the next sprint review.
Schedule the task for immediate work.
Correct answer
Submit the task to the change control board.
Overall explanation
Despite its criticality, Larry should still follow the project’s change control processes, and this will ensure the task is properly integrated into the project. Slotting the task in for immediate work is not ideal as this likely violates the project’s change control process. Sprint reviews are only found in agile projects. Doing nothing risks critical work being missed by Project Q.

You are the project manager for your organization and have been leading projects for the past ten years. Management has come to you and asked you to mentor three new project managers in the organization's best practices of project management. Which one of the following is not a mentoring approach that is effective for new project managers?
Correct answer
Working in the technology that the project centers on
Showing consistency in one's action and transparency in one's communication
Modeling appropriate behavior
Demonstrating effective problem-solving skills
Overall explanation
Working in the technology that the project centers on can be helpful as the project manager must have relative knowledge; however, this is the weakest option for mentoring, so this is the correct choice for this scenario. Modeling appropriate behavior is a good example to set for those being mentored. Demonstrating effective problem-solving skills is a good approach for mentoring new project managers. Show consistency in one's actions and transparency in one's communication is something all project managers should aspire to achieve.

As the project manager at Perry Plastics, Cecilia has been assigned a new project. In the project planning phase, Cecilia must create a project cost estimate. For project cost estimation, which of the following is the most reliable source Cecilia may use?
Vendors' whitepapers
Team members' recollections that have worked on similar projects
An SME's opinion
Correct answer
Historical information from a project recently completed
Overall explanation
Historical information from a recently completed project is Cecilia's most reliable cost estimation source and is the correct response. Although vendors' whitepapers may be valuable in the planning process, it is an incorrect response. Team member's recollections is an incorrect response because recollections are the least reliable source of information Cecilia could use. While an SME's opinion is valuable, historical information is a more reliable way to estimate project costs.

An agile coach is helping the senior management in an organization to understand the basics of agile contracting. Midway through the discussion, one of the senior managers raises a concern that the team's idea might not deliver all the product functionality. The senior manager expresses that this situation does not sit well with him. He would prefer an up-front estimate for delivering the whole product per the defined criteria, not a subset. What is the best approach the agile coach can recommend to the group for preparing agile contracts?
Allow for early completion of scope and items being fit for business purposes.
Allow for early completion of scope and items conformance to the original specifications.
Allow for reprioritization of scope and items conformance to the original specifications.
Correct answer
Allow for reprioritization of scope and items being fit for business purposes.
Overall explanation
Agile projects typically use contracting models designed for an agile environment and require closer cooperation between the project team, vendors, and the customer. This cooperation helps direct the team's effort toward delivering value-adding features. Agile contracts are always focused on the ability to reprioritize work and the goal of satisfying the business rather than conforming to a fixed specification. Agile contracts are always focused on the ability to reprioritize work and the goal of satisfying the business rather than conforming to a fixed specification. The team's efforts are directed on work being fit for business purposes and passing tests rather than early completion or matching a spec.

Samantha is a scrum master for Book Corporation and is beginning a new project. She determines how various stakeholder groups will interact but needs some guidance on setting up formal guidelines. What should Samantha do next?
Do nothing. The product owner is responsible for this.
Correct answer
Consult with her project management office.
Speak to other scrum masters or project managers.
Meet with all the stakeholders to determine roles and responsibilities.
Overall explanation
Samantha should work with her project management office to get best practices and advice on setting up a governance structure. Meeting with the stakeholders will not be successful without a framework to guide discussions. Doing nothing will not help Samantha; in addition, there is no evidence this project is agile or predictive. Other scrum masters or project managers may offer advice, but this is not the best option.

Laura manages risk well in her project at Hooper’s Store. Her team is considering two scenarios related to a user story. In the first scenario, they can get the item done in only one week, but they will have to refactor it in the next six months. In the second approach, they can get the item done in two weeks without refactoring. What is Laura most likely to remind her team?
Correct answer
That completing work without immediate refactoring is a significant risk to the project and reduces the value.
Nothing, as it is not her place to give the team guidance in their approach.
That speed of work is critical to provide the highest level of value.
That refactoring is expected for all work eventually and is expected to be scheduled for a later sprint.
Overall explanation
Given that managing risk is part of the agile methodology, Laura should mention that delayed refactoring causes significant risk to the project and reduces value. Speed is not always the most critical element to provide the highest level of value. Refactoring is expected as part of every user story and is not something to be scheduled later. It is appropriate for Laura to provide guidance based on agile principles.

Overall explanation
By continually measuring each deliverable's benefits, Olga can appraise the stakeholders on how the project will benefit Ballers Corporation. Qualitative analysis is used to quantify the size or impact of a risk. Consultants for the project team will not provide an accurate estimate on benefits without a measurement system in place.

As a project manager, you should be familiar with human resource theories. There are multiple theories and philosophies that can affect the way a manager leads and manages a project team. Which of the following management theories is an example of the X in Theory of X and Y?
Team members who can work on their own.
Correct answer
Micromanagement
Project teams that are self-led.
EVM
Overall explanation
The correct response is micromanagement, a method regarding X that assists certain workers in the completion of their work. The X in the Theory of X and Y claims workers have an innate dislike of work and, if possible, will avoid it. EVM is not directly linked to McGregor's Theory of X and Y. Earned value management is used to show project performance on time and costs. Self-led project teams are not examples of X in McGregor's Theory of X and Y. Team members able to work independently are not examples of X in McGregor's Theory of X and Y.

You are the project manager of a complex software development project. You are using a hybrid approach of waterfall for some areas of the project and the scrum approach for other parts of the project work. Your team members vary from experienced software developers to new developers eager to prove their abilities. Your organization has asked you to ensure team development for the group as many similar projects are coming, and this team of people will likely be working together for at least two years. What should you do next?
Determine what training you should provide to the project team.
Discuss the rules and policies for the organizational structure of the project.
Correct answer
Consider how best to develop the skills of each team member.
Create rules for the predictive portion of the project and definitions for the agile portions of the project.
Overall explanation
Of all choices presented, the best option is to consider how best to develop the skills of each team member. You want to ensure that each team member has the skills and understanding to perform well in the project. The first step should be an evaluation of the team and then how you will develop the skills. Training is often good, but there's no evidence training is needed in this scenario. Agile and predictive projects both need rules and definitions. While discussing the rules and policies is a good option for any project, the question aims to define team development.

Paired programming
Overall explanation
Paired programming should be done throughout the day and will allow the team to notice when something is wrong.

Craig is a junior software developer with relatively low influence at your organization. However, Craig is extraordinarily interested in a web design project that you are managing. Craig worked on a very similar project at his previous organization. Craig's project was fraught with risk, but his team delivered the project's deliverables successfully. How would you best manage Craig's engagement as a stakeholder?
Correct answer
Invite Craig to help analyze project risks in all project work.
Train Craig on the technical requirements for the project.
Ensure that you understand what Craig needs, include him in all team meetings, and ensure he receives project reports.
Meet with Craig periodically and keep him informed of risk reviews.
Overall explanation
Because Craig has little influence, he should not be included in all team meetings nor receiving all project reports. Ideally, Craig will be able to provide information on risk analysis. After Craig helps the team analyze the project risk, his involvement with the project should decrease, and he should not need to attend periodic meetings. Craig is not the project manager but serves as a subject matter expert (SME) on the project, so he only needs to help the team identify project risk. Craig does not require training as he is very familiar with the technical work. Meeting with Craig periodically and keeping him informed of risk reviews is a tempting choice, but the best choice is the initial analysis of project risks, as Craig does not need to be updated on risks in all project work.

His project manager, Abdul, will be on vacation for the next two weeks and has asked Andrew to oversee the change control process in his absence. The project manager has leeway over quick and inexpensive changes, but significant changes always flow through a change control board in the organization. Today, a change request has come into the project change control queue. The change request suggests that the coding language standards should be updated. This change would not take much time, and Andrew knows how to perform this action. How should Andrew proceed?
Correct answer
Andrew should assess the impact of this change and submit a change request to the change control board.
Because Andrew knows how to do this and it would not take long, he should update the coding language standards.
Andrew should ask his functional manager to approve this change.
Andrew should ask the project management office to approve this change.
Overall explanation
Andrew must assess the impact of this change and submit a change request to the change control board. When a change control board is part of the project management approach, changes flow through this committee for approval, deferral, or declined status. While Andrew knows how to perform this action, it may be inappropriate and could cause problems in the project if he does not go through the integrated change control process. The functional manager is not the person to approve or decline this change. The change control board should approve or decline the change in the project. Andrew should not ask the project management office to approve the change as the change must go through the change control process.

The project is projected to last one year, and changes to the project scope will not be allowed unless absolutely required by the technical solution team. The project management office has asked you to send them a document that outlines how changes in the project will be managed. Which document will you send to the project management office?
Requirements documentation and project charter
Change control system
Correct answer
Change management plan
Configuration management plan
Overall explanation
You will send the project management office a change management plan. This plan defines how changes will be managed and controlled in the project. Complex projects require more control, so the project management office likely wants to see how changes will be prevented from entering the project. A change control system may be specified within a change management plan, but it is a document that contains information about how changes will be managed and controlled. A configuration management plan outlines naming conventions and version control systems and conventions for the project's documentation, features, and functions.

Bruce is hired as an agile coach for Marvel Industries, Ltd. During a training session, and he is asked why changes found later in the project are more expensive. Which of the following is the least likely reason?
If a problem is found, more stakeholders might get impacted.
More code might have to be refactored.
More rework might be needed if a fix is to be applied.
Correct answer
Features might increase and have to be supported.
Overall explanation
The question is asking about the least likely reason. More features could also add to project cost, but the need to support them is not necessarily related to the cost of change. This is least likely to affect the cost of change. The other answers are typical reasons why the cost of change goes up over time in a project.

An agile development team is working on a project that has external dependencies. While implementing some of the current iteration features, they experienced frequent hold-ups due to those dependencies. During the retrospective meeting, they decided to ensure that, in the future, all dependencies should be met before an item can be accepted into an iteration for development. Where should this information be included?
Definition of nearly done
Iteration backlog
Correct answer
Definition of ready
Acceptance criteria
Overall explanation
Definition of ready determines when a backlog item is ready for development. Having a "definition of ready" means that stories must be immediately actionable. The team must determine what needs to be done and the amount of work required to complete the user story or PBI. Product backlog items that can be "done" by the development team within one sprint are deemed "ready" for selection in sprint planning. Product backlog items that are on top usually acquire this degree of transparency through the refining activities. Acceptance criteria can describe the requirements to be accepted by the customer or pass the needed quality requirements, but it is not the same as the Definition of Done. There is no definition of nearly done, so this choice is not valid. An iteration backlog, such as the sprint backlog, describes the team's work to complete in the current iteration.

Responding to change over following a plan
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Correct answer
Both individuals and interactions over processes and tools and working software over comprehensive documentation
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Overall explanation
The team was specifically spending time as individuals rather than using a tool to send a message about the issue and focused on getting things working immediately instead of adding documentation for what was missing. This issue has nothing to do with the customer or contract. Although the requirements clarified are a change, this is not as good an answer choice as the correct one. The value of individuals and interactions over processes and tools is a part of this, but working software over comprehensive documentation is the best choice.

His project team has questioned his decision not to assign the same amount of time for the last 800 sinks that he assigned for the first 500. Vivek tells his team the reason is because of the learning curve. Of the following, which best describes this theory?
Correct answer
As workers become more familiar with the installation procedures, efficiency increases.
As workers complete more of the installation procedures, time decreases in the final phase of the project.
As workers complete more of the installation, costs decrease.
Production is increased when workers become more efficient with the installation procedure.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is efficiency increases as workers become more familiar with installation procedures. As a result of decreased installation time, the learning curve allows the cost to decrease. As workers become more familiar with the installation procedure, they will complete more of it. This response is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the learning curve in relation to time and cost.

The best theoretical solutions come from developers.
The meeting time will be shorter by involving the whole team.
Correct answer
To facilitate buy-in, the group together can identify, diagnose, and ultimately solve the issue.
Multiple solutions will be introduced by the team.
Overall explanation
A team may not buy-in to a solution or “fix”, coming from someone who has not seen all aspects of the issue. However, a benefit of all-inclusive problem-solving is that a team will buy-in to a “fix” that they have discussed and solved together. It is not proven that developers have the best theoretical solutions. The benefits of a meeting are not necessarily affected by the time length of the meeting.

Lack of cultural awareness
Lack of active listening
Lack of leadership
Correct answer
Lack of stakeholder management
Overall explanation
A lack of stakeholder management stems from allowing stakeholders to overstep the boundaries necessary for successfully completing a project. Stakeholders need to know what constraints a team has if they are to be effective advocates; otherwise, they may overpromise on behalf of a team. A lack of active listening occurs when teams do not reflect stakeholder statements in their own words to confirm understanding or solicit additional information, which is not the problem in this case. A lack of cultural awareness generally occurs when people from different backgrounds overlook contextual clues that might be obvious to people from the same background. A lack of leadership occurs when there is no vision or inspiration to run the project correctly.

The previous project manager left the company in frustration, and no one seems to know what is going on with the project or the root cause for failure. Martin is coming into the situation somewhat cold, and the first thing that he wishes to do is create a "report card" of important metrics specific to the project and the company. What are these metrics called?
TPS reports
Measurement reports
Correct answer
Key performance indicators
Risk matrix
Overall explanation
Martin needs to establish key performance indicators which are specific to his project and company. Once this is established, he can better assess the project and look for the places where the project is failing and seek to improve them. A TPS report ("test procedure specification") is a document used by a quality assurance group or individual, particularly in software engineering, that describes the testing procedures and the testing process. Measurement reports are values reported from the MS that contain information about channel quality. Measurement reports assist the network in making handover and power control decisions. A risk matrix is a matrix used during risk assessment to define the level of risk by considering the category of probability or likelihood against the category of consequence severity. This is a simple mechanism to increase the visibility of risks and assist management in decision making.

Which of the following actions should Kevin request to best serve his role in the project?
Request for the most proficient software development test to approve or reject the minimum viable product (MVP) during each sprint review as he is most familiar with the software.
Correct answer
Request mentorship from an agile coach as his role closely aligns with that of a product owner.
Request for one of the testers to take the end-user role and prioritize the user stories in the product backlog.
Request to be assigned to another project as he is only familiar with traditional project management.
Overall explanation
For this scenario, Kevin should receive training from an agile coach. Although no product owner is assigned, Kevin's role as a business analyst most closely resembles that of a product owner. The business analyst usually works with the customer to determine and refine project requirements and develop the requirements documentation. Software cannot help Kevin in this transition, but coaching from an agile practitioner can. Today's organizations tend to adopt agile methodologies. If Kevin decides not to learn, he will quickly become unemployable. Even if a tester takes on the role of an end-user, the end-user does not prioritize the stories in the backlog, the product owner does.

She is in a sprint planning meeting with the product owner working with the development team on what user stories should be selected for the project's next iteration. The team has a current velocity of 25 story points. In the meeting, Josephine notices that many items do not appear to be prioritized as she understands stakeholders have requested. What should Josephine do next?
Tell the product manager to fill in the missing information.
As the scrum master, it is up to Josephine to assign priorities.
Correct answer
Ask the product owner to clarify the prioritization of the user stories.
Do nothing. The product owner will fill in this information later.
Overall explanation
Reviewing the list with the product owner will allow Josephine to understand the requirements better and may rectify the need for the product backlog to be groomed before the next iteration work begins. Josephine does not want the team to work on lower priority tasks and miss high-priority opportunities. Josephine should not assume the product owner will fill out this missing information. The product owner is generally responsible for determining the backlog priority, not the scrum master. Telling the product owner to fill in the missing information is not optimal as it robs Josephine of the opportunity to partner with the product owner.

Skipped
An organization has hired Ali to teach agile methodologies to a team of developers. She plans to use a website development project to teach the methods. As an agile coach, Ali's primary goal is to highlight value delivery to the team while reinforcing agile pillars and values throughout the process. Feedback loops are often inserted into sprints to ensure continuous learning throughout the development lifecycle. Whose role is it to ensure lessons learned are shared amongst the team, and during which ceremony?
The entire team, during the project retrospective meeting
The entire team, during the daily standup meeting
The scrum master, during project retrospective meeting
Correct answer
The entire team, during the sprint retrospective meeting
Overall explanation
It is up to the entire team to ensure lessons learned are shared and incorporated throughout the project. The feedback mechanism is built into each sprint through the sprint retrospective meeting to improve on future sprints. In agile environments, the entire team, and not the scrum master, lead the project. Lessons learned are captured during the sprint retrospective meeting, not at the project retrospective meeting, to integrate the lessons learned in the next sprint.

Linda and her team have produced a new working software that is exactly what the customer requested. They demonstrated the software, and the customer realized that what they asked for was not really what they wanted. What is the best agile approach to resolving this issue?
The team should execute the appropriate change control process to ensure that the client cannot introduce changes that were not in the original contract without the proper series of approvals.
The project manager should have a firm discussion with the customer, who should know that they cannot change things once an iteration has begun.
Correct answer
The project manager should immediately submit a change control request to the change review board to ensure the customer’s change is considered as quickly as possible.
The team should employ a flexible contract model and adjust the shared definition of done with the customer to accommodate their changing preferences.
Overall explanation
A flexible contract with the ability to adjust to the customer’s needs is the most agile approach. A rigorous and inflexible change control process is not the best agile approach. A change review board and a formal process is also not the best agile approach. Telling clients that they cannot change their minds in the project is futile, not an agile one.

Scoring models
Murder board
Correct answer

When McMahon & Tate converted to agile methods, they stopped giving likely completion dates for their projects. When Greg’s agile coach reviewed this process, she was most likely to tell him
That likely completion dates can be measured by taking the remaining story points and dividing them by expected velocity in hours.
Correct answer
That likely completion dates can be a good tool for measuring progress on an agile project.
That likely completion dates should never be used, as it is far too difficult to calculate.
That likely completion dates should never be used, as it will constantly change.
Overall explanation
The likely completion date is a valid key performance indicator for agile projects. The likely completion date is not difficult to calculate due to the total remaining points divided by the average velocity of each sprint in points. There is no agile principle that a likely completion date should not be used. The likely completion date is not found by the remaining story points divided by velocity in hours.

John is the project manager of a software development project. His organization has chosen to use the Scrum framework for software development projects. His team, however, does not have any agile experience. John explains the agile lifecycle and the iterative approach the project will take. John works with the product owner and the development team to help them better understand Scrum. Since this is a new team, John and the team elect to utilize a two-week approach for each sprint. The team is confused about what the product owner will do on the project and who is in charge. What is the primary role of the product owner?
Correct answer
To maintain the product backlog
To oversee the sprint review work that the team completes
To build the product scope
To coach the team on user stories for the product backlog
Overall explanation
The product owner maintains and prioritizes the user stories in the product backlog. This is sometimes called grooming the product backlog. The product owner does not build the product scope, as this is not an agile term. In addition, the product backlog is based on stakeholder requirements for the project. The sprint review comes at the end of the sprint and is demonstrated by the development team on what they have completed in the project. The product owner may coach the team on user stories, but this is not their primary role in the project.

Which of the following can help the team to accomplish that?
Correct answer
Acceptance test
Unit test
Scripted test
Exploratory test
Overall explanation
An acceptance test refers to the process of testing a new system, feature, or functionality against predefined acceptance criteria. In other words, an acceptance test evaluates whether the product feature has met predefined requirements to mark a user story complete. Acceptance criteria and the Definition of Done determine the scope and requirements that developers must execute to consider the user story finished. They give developers the context needed to execute a user story. Exploratory testing means the test explores the software. Unit testing tests each unit of software and is typically done by the developers as they develop the code. Scripted testing follows detailed scripts and tests.

Bobby is a project manager who is entering pricing negotiations with a vendor who creates specialized soundproofing material. The soundproofing materials have been developed by the vendor's organization and are not available through other resources. Bobby enjoys working with the vendor and he wants the relationship to last, but Bobby also wants the best price possible. In a recent meeting with the vendor, Bobby decided to start negotiations aggressively low to see what the vendor could do. Is this a good strategy for Bobby?
Yes, he needs to set the tone for the relationship.
No, he should let someone else negotiate on his behalf.
Correct answer
No, he is sacrificing a relationship and a resource for price.
Yes, if he wants a reasonable price and the relationship is good.
Overall explanation
Bobby should consider the long-term relationship here and negotiate the best price while also keeping an eye on the future. They may give Bobby his price but deal with him harshly down the line. While Bobby's strategy might get him the price that he wants and set a tone for the relationship, it may not produce the desired results. It is possible that the vendor could balk at the tone and remove themselves from negotiations. Bobby does not need someone else to negotiate for him, but he needs to seek out a fair agreement and protect the relationship. There is no reason to be rude.

Amanda uses ROI to calculate the value a potential one-year international project will provide at Lexcorp. The expected revenue is $500,000 with an ROI of 10 percent. What does this tell Amanda about her project?
The expected project costs exceeded the expected project benefit by $50,000.
This project should be chosen ahead of a project where the NPV is $45,000.
The project should be undertaken.
Correct answer
There is an expected return on the investment.
Overall explanation
A positive ROI of $50,000 indicates there is an expected return. A positive ROI does not guarantee that the project should be done, as other projects may provide greater benefit. ROI cannot be directly compared to NPV. A positive ROI indicates that potential costs are expected to be less than the project benefits, not more.

As the project manager for Lopez Logistics, Jenna has contracted two companies to complete part of the latest project, who will need to work together on certain parts of the project. One vendor is responsible for connecting the networking cables to a central patch panel and to the individual network receptacles; the other vendor is responsible for network cable installation throughout a building. The vendors cannot agree on how the work should take place. For Jenna to manage this scenario effectively, what is the best approach to use?
Correct answer
To find the best solution for the project, use conflict resolution because the vendors are stakeholders.
To find the best solution for the contracted work, use conflict resolution, even though the vendors are not stakeholders.
Because vendors are not stakeholders, they need to live up to their contract terms.
Because vendors are stakeholders, figure out who will do what activities in the project.
Overall explanation
Vendors are project stakeholders, and the project manager must use conflict resolution to find the best project solution. Even though project contracts may have previously defined the order of the work and the agreement terms, the project manager must meet with the vendors to ensure all parties work together and for the project to proceed smoothly. Because vendors are affected by the project and can affect the success of the project, they are considered stakeholders. Because vendors are stakeholders, be prepared if an issue escalates, an alternative dispute resolution may be necessary. Although it is not always the case, it is ideal when the contract defines all work aspects and requirements for the vendors to work with each other.

An agile project is at the conclusion of the tenth iteration. The business representative sees no added value in continuing further with the project. However, he is not sure the contract can be terminated. Which of the following type of contracts allows the customer to terminate the agreement at any time on the project if they do not see any added value?
Correct answer
Agile time and materials contract
Agile iteration contract
Agile phased development contract
Agile early termination contract
Overall explanation
An agile time and materials contract allows the customer to terminate the contract at any time on the project if they do not see any added value. With the time and materials contract in agile, the onus falls to the vendor to regularly deliver value all through the project. Because software development and testing are done in short iterations (two to four weeks), the vendor will always have value to show for the money spent—an iteration of the project. Iterating over small timeframes works if the customer is clear (at the start of a sprint) regarding the most valuable features the vendor can deliver in that time. Therefore, if the customer believes that they do not see any added value after a certain number of iterations, they can terminate the contract. The vendor gets paid for the product/service delivered until that iteration. An agile iteration contract is not a valid contract type for the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. An agile phased development contract is not the best choice. An early termination contract is not a valid contract type.

What kind of feedback does the project manager give?
No feedback
Non-specific feedback

Giving only negative feedback can give the impression that a project manager is dissatisfied with an employee's performance, even if this is not necessarily the case. Delaying feedback is not evident in the question as the annual performance review is happening. No feed is incorrect as Brianna is giving feedback through the review.

You are asked to speak before a group of interns concerning the project management life cycle's varying objectives. As you end your speech, one of the interns asks you about the most important consideration during the initial planning phases. What considerations do you describe as the most vital?
Scope and cost of the overall project.
The ability to monitor and control the project.
The ability to ensure the quality of deliverables.
Correct answer
Project risk must be identified as early as possible.
Overall explanation
Project risk is the greatest at the beginning of every project. As time passes and the project objectives are met, the project risks become less and less until the end, where it is almost non-existent. The scope and cost of the overall project are considered early in the project, but corresponding risks can threaten these two objectives. The ability to ensure the quality of deliverables is a valid choice, but the risk can threaten quality if not addressed quickly in the project. The ability to monitor and control the project is not considered as early in the project as risks are.

Once the changes have been approved, the project manager should reflect the additional schedule, cost, and scope changes accordingly in each baseline. The changes are not reflected in the change control documentation, which explains the process for how changes may enter the project scope.

During a recent backlog grooming session with her product manager, Lisa noticed several new stories submitted by end-users. The product manager tells Lisa that they should be worked on immediately since they come from an end-user. What should Lisa do next?
Assign the stories to the project team.
Contact the user who submitted the stories and tell them to stop giving her team more work.
Correct answer
Review the new stories with the product owner to determine if they add value to the project.
Tell the product owner to remove the stories since the development team has not signed off on them.
Overall explanation
Before prioritizing work into the backlog, both Lisa and the product owner should confirm it adds value to the project. This will ensure the project is producing something of worth and not gold plating or adding useless features. Assigning the stories to the project team without determining if they add value risks introducing useless features. The development team does not need to sign off on adding stories to the backlog. Agile is intended to accept work from any source, so telling the end user to stop submitting ideas is counterproductive.

The chart represents the cost threshold and the decision point for the project manager, stakeholders, and the steering committee. For example, if the cost is less than $5,000, but greater than $1,000, the stakeholder can make that decision. This table is not likely linked to bonus amounts.

Correct answer
Determine a baseline for what a story point is worth.
Review the team's ground rules.
Play planning poker.
Consult with the product owner.
Overall explanation
Before the team can begin assigning points, they must understand how much a point is "worth." This can be done by grouping tasks that seem to be similar in complexity to ensure the team understands the point values. Planning poker is done after the team understands the value of a point. The product owner will not be able to help the team baseline point values. The ground rules are used for determining appropriate behavior.

The project team is loyal to the project manager, and they feel angry about the project's status and that the former project manager was let go. Senior management is trusting you to fix the problem and get the project back on track. The project team is not welcoming you, the new project manager, and they do not seem to offer much information about the project. You also experience other stakeholders that are keeping their distance and not contributing to your efforts. What can you lean on to get up to speed on the project and transfer knowledge to yourself?
Just keep working on the project, and the problems will reveal themselves.
Call the old project manager and ask for their help.
You would need to start from scratch.
Correct answer
Review all plan documents and records thoroughly.
Overall explanation
This is a challenging situation. Without the project team on board, your saving grace is plan documents and gathered data. While not having others to rely on is tough, studying the plan documents will get you up to speed, potentially reveal problems and offer a chance to look at the project from a fresh standpoint. You will not need to start from scratch as the project is already in motion and some progress has been made. Management has asked you to get the project back on track, not scrap the effort and start over. Yes, you will need to continue working on the project, but you will need insight into the project problems and to develop a plan on how best to resolve the situation.

You are forced to accept the risk. Avoidance implies that the risk can be removed from the project, but in this instance, it cannot because the risk is inherent to the project work. An exploit is a risk response when the risk is identified as a positive risk or opportunity. Mitigation is a response to lower or eliminate the risk impact. In this instance, there is nothing that can be done about the risk.

Katie recently lost an employee to a rival firm. The employee had several tasks expected to complete each month, all of which were highly autonomous and seldom collaborative. To resume operations, Katie needs to add knowledge about the tasks to her project's knowledge repository or, at the very least, take some notes about the tasks to prepare the employee's replacement. Katie decides that she will call the employee to ask about the tasks. Which level of knowledge is required?
Project-level
Portfolio-level
Correct answer
Individual-level
Surface-level
Overall explanation
Individual-level knowledge is required when a single employee performs a task or tasks. Project-level knowledge is typically spread among project managers, leaders, and team members. Portfolio-level knowledge usually requires knowledge of several programs within an organization. This level of knowledge is overkill for the level of knowledge required in this case. Surface-level knowledge means the learner has a shallow or basic understanding of the concept being learned.

Ace is a project manager in the United States preparing a project, and a presidential election is three months away. The current president cannot seek another term. The two frontrunners for the job have very different philosophies on business. One has a capitalist mindset with an eye towards deregulation, the other promises to sign executive orders right away, creating more regulations. Ace’s project is large and complex and is likely to be affected by the presidential change. Ace has prepared a preliminary charter that presumes a dynamic very similar to the current one. How should Ace proceed from here?
Assume more regulation is coming, and that candidate will win.
Wait until after the election to move forward with the project.
Correct answer
Create flexibility in the charter and founding documents.
Assume that the deregulation candidate will win.
Overall explanation
Ace is best served by adding language to his charter and other founding documents that will allow for more regulation. If this language does not need to be utilized, there is no issue. Still, the project is already set up to address additional regulations and requirements as necessary by including it. Waiting for election results is not viable. A new president would need time to enact his vision for the nation, which is a lot of delay for Ace’s project. Ace cannot assume or presume to know who will win and the exact results or impact.

Betsy has a project that will produce a report on COVID-19 and corporate sales in the United States. Pi, the sales manager, wants Betsy to include big data in her compilation. Ryan, the CIO, wants Betsy to drill down into the specifics of each state and total sales. Maryann, the CFO, wants her report to focus more on sales by new customers, repeat customers, and time gaps between sales among repeat customers. Other stakeholders with less influence and authority have requirements that conflict with these stated requirements. Betsy is conflicted on what should be in the report. She needs consensus among the stakeholders and wants to keep politics and alliances from the validity of the project scope. What would be the best tool Betsy should use to build consensus?
Document analysis
Affinity diagram
Brainstorming
Correct answer
Delphi technique
Overall explanation
Betsy should utilize the Delphi technique to build consensus among the stakeholders. The Delphi technique uses rounds of anonymous surveys and is useful to identify the true requirements, issues, risks, and other factors within a project. The anonymous surveys remove political alliances and skewed opinions from altering the truly needed components that should go into the project scope. While brainstorming is useful for identifying ideas, it is not the best answer to build consensus among the stakeholders. Betsy should not rely on document analysis as she wants to identify new requirements, whereas document analysis is useful based on existing documentation and past projects. Betsy can use affinity diagrams to group similar suggestions, but affinity diagrams do not build consensus as the Delphi technique does.

You are leading a predictive software development project for your organization. Midway through the project, a programmer approaches you and lets you know that she has found an alternate method of performing a task that will save the project and company a great deal of time and money. What should you do next?
Do nothing as the project budget is already finalized.
Correct answer
Evaluate this alternate method and submit a change request.
Implement the change to the method of performing a task since it will save money.
Revisit this idea in the project retrospective to implement this for future projects.
Overall explanation
The project manager should always evaluate any suggested changes for project impacts. Once these impacts are assessed, the project manager should submit a change request. This project is a predictive project, so retrospectives are not being utilized. Doing nothing ignores the positive risk the team member has identified, so this choice is incorrect. The project manager should not implement this proposed change until a change request has been submitted and approved.

The transmission of knowledge
The outputting of knowledge
The presence of knowledge
Correct answer
The transfer of knowledge
Overall explanation
The transfer of knowledge is evidence that communication has happened and is the correct answer. This response is incorrect because while messages are transmitted, knowledge is transferred. This response is incorrect because knowledge output does not necessarily mean that the knowledge has come originally from its source and that it has been transferred to the recipient.

Three months into the project, Sara notices that the work quality of one of her team members, Sam, has declined but is still acceptable. Sara also notices that Sam has become less involved during team meetings. What should Sara do next in this scenario?
Report the declining quality of work to Sam's manager.
Publicly remind the entire team to stay engaged in the meetings.
Do nothing. Sam's work quality is still acceptable.
Correct answer
Privately check in with Sam to see if everything is OK.
Overall explanation
Sara should privately check in to see how Sam is doing. He may be experiencing stress from other areas in his life that are impacting his work. This information will help Sara better support Sam. Reporting the declining quality of work to Sam's manager will not address the underlying issues. Reminding the entire team to engage in meetings will not positively impact Sam's behavior. Doing nothing risks the problem becoming worse and further affecting his work quality.

Rachel is a project manager for a hybrid project in her organization. This project is scheduled to last six months and has a budget of $450,000. The project is currently on budget and one week ahead of schedule. Until recently, the project team had regularly raised concerns about potential blockers or other impediments to the project but has not done so recently. What should Rachel do?
Ask the steering committee if they are aware of any challenges.
Do nothing. If there is a problem, the team will let him know.
Correct answer
At the next daily standup, ask the team if they have any impediments to report.
Privately ask individual team members if they have noticed anything.
Overall explanation
The team has likely become complacent about reporting potential issues and should be actively reminded about the importance of being vigilant. Reminding the entire team in a public setting will help ensure they continue reporting potential issues. Even in a hybrid environment, the daily standup should prompt the team on what they have done since the last meeting, what they will complete today, and if there are any impediments to report. Doing nothing risks missing early warning signs of challenges. It is a good idea to ask the team in the daily standup to confirm that all is well. The steering committee is unlikely to have timely information on challenges that the project may face. Privately asking individual team members is time consuming and ineffective. The daily standup is the ceremony where the project manager should ask for any issues or impediments.

Question 156

An agile team working on building a learning management system software is halfway through the third increment. The developers follow the practice of starting work on new features whenever they are waiting on code review or testing. As a result, when the agile coach reviews the task board, he notices that very few features are in the "Complete" column. Most of the committed features for the iteration are showing as "In Progress." What is the best thing for an agile coach to do next?
Sensing risk, inform the stakeholders that the team will not have anything ready to demo for the current iteration.
Add more testers to the team to deal with the outstanding testing of the features.
Since the team is making progress on so many features, assume that the work will get done by the end of the iteration.
Correct answer
Inform the development team to help with code review and testing to finish existing tasks before starting a new one.
Overall explanation
Agile teams are cross-functional and must have all of the skills necessary to create an increment of work. Agile teams place value on members who focus on being "generalizing specialists" who do whatever it takes to move their work through all stages of development. They focus on getting each task finished per the Definition of Done before moving on to the next one. In the current scenario, everyone on the development team has the skills to help with code review and testing. By focusing on collaborating and making the workflow, the whole team gets more done and creates a higher-quality product together. You should not assume the work will be complete just because there is motion in the project. Adding team members, even testers, can cause an interruption in the project as the new members have to ramp-up on the project. This is not a valid action for the iteration. Focus on getting things done rather than delaying the work or sprint review. In addition, the team is to be self-organizing, not directed.

You are the project manager for your organization, and you have just completed a large, complex project that lasts 18 months. Management has now assigned you a similar project with a few changes. One of the changes is that the new project must be completed in 12 months rather than 18 months. Today, you are presenting drafted project management plans to your supervisor. Part of your plan is to double the size of your project team to complete the needed amount of work in the 12-month requirement. Your supervisor tells you to "beware of the law of diminishing returns." In this statement, your supervisor is warning you about which of the following?
The more time you spend on a project, the less valuable it becomes.
After you have spent the estimated project budget, the project loses value.
Correct answer
After a certain point, adding more resources will not yield a proportional increase in productivity.
The same amount of depreciation is taken out every year.
Overall explanation
The law of diminishing returns states that adding more resources will not yield a proportional increase in productivity after a certain point; this is true for all projects. Increasing the amount of labor may be counterproductive and take longer for the organization to realize the cost of the labor from the returns the project may generate. Project value concerning elapsed time or budget varies on a project-by-project basis. The law of diminishing returns has nothing to do with depreciation values. The value of a project is in the business value, not the budget to do the work and create the deliverables. Spending the project budget is an investment, not a loss to value.

You are the project manager for your organization. Your current project is to create a nature trail in a local park. This trail will not be paved but will have gravel as its base. The trail is a four-mile loop around a lake and has some rugged hiking portions. You are at a point in the project where you are ready to order the gravel materials, so you send a request for a quote to several vendors. How should the vendors respond?
Correct answer
Provide you with a price for the gravel.
Provide you with a proposal on how they will deliver the materials to the job site.
Invite you to a bidders conference to discuss the statement of work.
Provide you with a price for the gravel and how it will be delivered.
Overall explanation
Requests for quotes are focused on price only. No additional information is needed from the vendor. A request for a quote would not warrant a proposal or additional information from the vendor, so this choice is incorrect. A request for a quote would be a quote only on the work or materials the buyer requests. Additional information or proposals is not necessary. The bidder's conference is hosted by the buyer and is usually for large contracts. It is a meeting to discuss the statement of work and helps the bidders create a price and proposal for the work.

Which of the following techniques for gathering requirements is best facilitated by a trained professional?
Nominal group technique
Interviews
Multicriteria decision analysis
Correct answer
Focus groups
Overall explanation
Due to their highly interactive nature, focus groups are most effective when moderated by a trained professional who can collect their feedback effectively with a select group of individuals. Interviews are a face-to-face communication technique performed by a project manager to identify product functions and features. Nominal group techniques are methods to allow efficient group voting.

Before, during and after iterations, it is of the utmost importance to include numerous touchpoints with stakeholders. Why is this so important?
To show stakeholders how hard the team is working.
So the direction of the development team can be presented to stakeholders.
So the team’s value can be demonstrated with multiple meetings.
Correct answer
To identify the possibility of risks and issues and to be notified of change requests.
Overall explanation
The agile methodology calls for multiple touchpoints with stakeholders. The team and the stakeholders need to meet frequently to ensure that the team hears stakeholders’ change requests and identifies potential issues and risks. It is not part of the agile methodology to include telling stakeholders the development team’s direction. Value is not demonstrated by holding multiple meetings. The incorporation of stakeholders’ values and ideas assures that nothing is planned without their support. Stakeholders want to see the team creating results – this is what they want and value in a project, not just being told everyone on the team is working hard.

Your organization has accepted a contract to construct a bridge in your city. As part of this incentive-based contract, the organization, you, and your project team will receive a sizeable bonus for every day you complete the project ahead of schedule. As the project manager, you have shared the incentive goal with your project team and they have agreed to work six days a week, rather than the usual five. Three months into the project the project is clearly four weeks ahead of schedule if the team had worked the usual five days a week. However, you notice that several of your team members are visibly stressed with the workload and long hours the project is requiring. You are concerned the project team may begin to falter as they are overworked and tired. What should you do next in the scenario to mitigate the risk of the team's energy and buy-in on the project?
Ask the team if they would like more people to work on the bridge project.
Correct answer
Recommend that the team takes a few days off from the project work.
Use your emotional intelligence to understand why the team is tired.
Remind the team why they are working all the overtime.
Overall explanation
Overworking the team can cause risks and frustration for the individuals. With the project being so far ahead, you should recommend that the team takes some time away from the project and have some work-life balance. While receiving a bonus for being done early is nice, most incentive-based contracts have a maximum bonus for the organization, so the time away may not affect the bonus incentive. It is important to respect the individuals on the project work and be reasonable on how much additional work one can do without affecting the quality of the project and the safety of the people completing the work. The team is already aware of why they are working overtime and this choice could be insulting to the people doing the work. This choice does not resolve the issue with the project team and their energy level. It does not take emotional intelligence to see why people are tired and this choice does not solve the problem in the scenario. More workers on the project may help the project finish faster, but it does not address the needed break from the project work. In addition, more people on the project takes time to add, might dilute the value of the incentive-based contract, and there is a learning curve the new workers will need in the project.

Donald’s team area includes a cave. The cave has been in demand, where everyone who needs to use it has not been able to due to the lack of space in the small room. The best solution for resolving this problem is
Placing smaller furniture in the room to enable more capacity.
Creating a sign-up schedule posted on the team’s information radiator.
Expanding the size of the cave.
Correct answer
Facilitating a team discussion around the creation of quiet hours where the delivery team is not interrupted by others.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to approach the cause of this issue. Those who retreat to a cave are avoiding the team’s primary area. There are likely too many interruptions in the common area. The team should primarily use the common area except for the occasional need to retreat, so expanding the cave's size would not address the root cause of the issue. The team should primarily use the common area, so adding furniture would not be addressing the root cause of the issue. Agile would not encourage the overhead or formality of an extra schedule.

Ethan should direct the stakeholders to the change control process. This will allow them to submit the changes in a controlled manner. Then the change control process can be followed to determine the need for the changes and how the changes can be managed. The steering committee is not likely to be able to assist in this scenario as the project has mechanisms for changes in the change control process.

Explain to Brian that osmotic communication is vital to project success.
Allow Brian to work from home.
Correct answer

Overall explanation
The best solution is to use caves and commons. Caves are little rooms or nooks that allow for quiet, uninterrupted work by team members. Commons are open office plans that provide face-to-face communication. Allowing Brian to work from home removes him from the osmotic communication and team. Osmotic communication is a value, but Brian needs the benefits of caves and commons for his work.

Tanya has inherited a project from a retiring project manager. Before retiring, the previous project manager took Tanya aside to talk to her about Demetrius. Demetrius has firm ideas about the project's priorities due to his long-time relationship with the stakeholders. Tanya is surprised to learn this since Demetrius seems to have significant institutional knowledge and confidence. He often says that many people on his team do not know what is going on and that others are too timid to document requirements effectively. Eventually, the stakeholders confide in Tanya, letting her know that they often find it challenging to advance ideas for features if they differ from ideas that Demetrius advocates. When they do, Demetrius is often condescending, asking if they have really thought about the consequences of their decisions. As a result, stakeholders appease Demetrius but are often dissatisfied with the project's features and consistently request revisions. The project has missed milestones and has recently gone over budget. What is the source of the conflict?
Project priorities
Cultural differences
Team environment
Correct answer
Personality
Overall explanation
Personality is the driving factor in a conflict when an individual's behavior puts them at odds with the team and the project's priorities. If a project manager does not address interpersonal conflict early in a project, the team's morale can be affected in later phases. Conflicts arising from team environments are related to team members not knowing each other well enough or having multiple bosses. Cultural differences can be a source of conflict if the way a group of team members does things differs significantly from another group's approach. Project priorities are evident when two projects are competing for the same resource, such as a team member or piece of equipment.

Of the following choices, which should Austin do first in this situation?
Find a workaround.
Alert the project sponsor.
Correct answer
Update the change log.
Find a vendor to perform the work.
Overall explanation
Before any other action is taken, Austin should update the change log. The change log is a centralized place to monitor change request status and outcomes. Austin may need to find a workaround, but he should first update the change log. Finding a vendor to perform the work is not the first thing Austin would do in this scenario. Alerting the project sponsor may be the second thing Austin needs to do, but this is not the next thing he should do in this scenario.

Bradley is the project manager for a technical infrastructure project. His project is currently on schedule and budget, though there have been some challenges in the project execution. Most of the challenges deal with the project team which is located across four time zones and three countries. Key stakeholders are concerned about the project execution. Once a month, Bradley sends out a survey to the entire team asking about their engagement and compares the results to work status reports. What is the best explanation for this behavior?
A stakeholder asked Bradley to survey the team regularly.
Correct answer
Bradley wants to monitor his virtual team's engagement and effectiveness actively.
The project management office requires regular surveys of effectiveness.
Bradley wants the team to know he is watching them.
Overall explanation
Bradley is likely concerned about his team's engagement. He can get a good idea of how the team is doing by actively asking about how they are doing and comparing that to work results. Stakeholders are concerned about the project execution, not the engagement among the project team members. The project management office requiring regular effectiveness surveys is not evident in the question, so this is not the best choice. Bradley wanting the team to know he is watching them is not a good choice. A monthly survey on engagement is not going to tell the team the project manager is watching their work, but rather to check on their engagement within the project.

You are a project manager for your organization. Your project has a BAC of $250,000 and is expected to last ten months. Currently, the project is in month six and is 40 percent complete, but the project was expected to be 60 percent complete by this time. You have spent $125,000 to complete the work. What is the cost performance index of the project?
80
15
$125,000
Correct answer
0.8
Overall explanation
The cost performance index is calculated by dividing the earned value by the actual costs. In this instance, the formula is CPI = 100,000 / 125,000. This results in 0.80. The CPI is 0.80, not 80. 15 is not a valid calculation of the CPI. The CPI is not a dollar amount, so this choice is incorrect.

Warner is the scrum master for Project Frog, eight iterations into its deployment, and has a velocity of thirty-nine story points. Recently one of the countries where Project Frog operates began experiencing political upheaval due to a recent election. What should Warner do next?
Survey workers in the country to determine the impact on Project Frog.
Do nothing. The project will continue to progress.
Move Project Frog out of that country.
Correct answer
Evaluate tasks in the backlog to determine how they may be impacted.
Overall explanation
Warner should review the backlog to determine if the political upheaval will cause any impacts on Project Frog. This will help ensure any political changes do not adversely impact Project Frog. Doing nothing risks Project Frog being negatively impacted by the political changes. Moving Project Frog out of the country is not ideal as Project Frog's impact has not been confirmed. Surveying local workers will not help Warner determine how the events impact Project Frog.

The project must spend one dollar for every 98 cents of work it receives.
The project is late.
The project is 98 percent complete.
Overall explanation
A project with a CPI of 0.98 must spend one dollar for every 98 cents of work it receives. There is no evidence that the project is late. The project is losing money with this CPI, not making money. A CPI of 0.98 does not mean the project is 98 percent complete.

Ezra is the scrum master for Project Z, which has just started its first interaction with a new development team. Ezra has a developer approach him with concerns that the scope of Project Z is not yet finalized. How is Ezra likely to respond to this concern?
Tell the developer to get back to work and leave project management to Ezra.
Ezra will personally sign off on all changes.
The project team can accept or reject any change.
Correct answer
Agile allows projects to respond to changes by adjusting the backlog rapidly.
Overall explanation
Agile allows projects to adjust priorities between iterations by reprioritizing the backlog easily. This allows new tasks to be slotted in as necessary. The scrum master does not sign off on changes. The product owner confirms them. The project team does not sign off on changes. The product owner confirms them. Telling the developer to get back to work prevents them from learning about how agile handles change.

You are a project manager for a company that completes work for other organizations. Your company has a policy of not accepting gifts worth over $100 in value from vendors or customers. Your project work has saved the customer nearly $100,000 per quarter, and they are thrilled with your work. The customer knows about the company policy but really wants to show you their appreciation. They present you with a plaque and a $500 gift card for an electronics store in your hometown. Your organization will never know about the gift card if you do not report it. What should you do?
Accept the gift card, but use only $100 of the card because your company has set this as the limit.
Keep the plaque and donate the gift card to your favorite charity.
Correct answer
Politely decline the reward because of your company’s policy.
Use the gift card and do not tell your company. You have saved the customer a significant amount of money, and they want you to have a reward.
Overall explanation
You must politely decline the card because its value is more than $100. This is a clear violation of your company’s policy. Donating the card to charity would require you to accept the card, which is also a violation of your company’s policy. Although this seems like a feasible idea, the card has a value of $500, and to use even $100 of the card, you would have to accept the card, which violates your company’s policy.

Tina’s agile team has a decision to make. A member of the team, Ron, suggests that they could save time by not having a discussion and using a show of hands to show who is for and who is against the decision. If Tina objects to this decision-making approach, what is her most legitimate reason why?
Correct answer
She is concerned that without a discussion, there will not be any ideas for a better alternative to the decision.
Tina is concerned that some members will just vote for the resolution that is the least expensive.
She is concerned that some members will not vote for the resolution she herself wants.
Tina is concerned that some team members will just vote for the resolution that is the quickest.
Overall explanation
If a team does not discuss issues and decisions, no one will know why a particular decision is made for or against a certain solution. In order to produce a better or alternative decision for the issue, the team needs a discussion, not just a “for” or “against” vote. The other responses are incorrect. A vote for the cheapest or fastest resolution has nothing to do with the primary issue of a lack of discussion. (Of course, voting for the cheapest or fastest resolution is not in the stakeholders’ or project’s best interest). The team needs to make a decision that is best for the project, and not take into account what they are personally in favor of.

Seat of the pants project management
Working towards best in class
Correct answer
Management by memo organization
The blind leading the blind
Overall explanation
The organization is best described as management by memo organization – Low Competency and High Capability describe a dictatorial and functional independent organization. The organization drives all commands and edicts down to the masses since they "know" better. The individual members have basic or minimum project competency but not enough to question why or how it can be improved. Change is instituted on small scales with minimum impact to the de facto way of doing business. The blind leading the blind - Low Competency and Capability. When individuals and organizations are weak in their efforts, they may have the passion but not the executive team's direction. Working towards best in class – High Competency and Capability describes a coordinated effort of individuals possessing strong skills and a supportive organization that yields an oath that drives towards continuous improvement and monitored change.

Bricen is a project manager for Blue Sky Organization and has been assigned a new project. It was established that attendance greater than 90 percent would be a key performance indicator for the project's success during the planning. This was determined based on the training that would be needed during the project to complete specific tasks. The last review of the attendance KPI determined that the team was at 85 percent and was considered five percent below the amount of attendance required for success based on the KPI. Bricen should
Review each team member's attendance and determine who has been absent the most, then address the issue so that the key performance indicators go up as necessary on the next review.
Do nothing and see if the key performance indicators go up on the next review.
Review the key performance indicators to determine if it is still relevant and if the project is actually in jeopardy due to attendance being 85 percent or if the key performance indicators need to be changed.
Correct answer
Call a meeting with the entire team and cover the key performance indicators again, stressing the importance of attendance and measuring the project's success.
Overall explanation
All the team members should be adhering to the KPIs regardless of their perception of the KPI's relevance. It is up to the project manager and product owners to determine the relevance of a KPI. After the KPI has been evaluated, it may be changed if it is no longer relevant. Isolating the team member with the most absences does not really address the issue or offer a resolution. Consider team members that are absent 15, 14, and 13 days. Only the person that has been absent 15 days is addressed in this answer. The key performance indicators are still relevant, and performance needs to be addressed in order for this situation to be resolved. The key performance indicators might improve, but this answer does not take on the issue at all, so it is not the best choice.

After the first SOW, the vendor learned that the second and third work packages were more complicated and would likely cost $10,000 more each. Her vendor is expected to

Correct answer
Estimate the second package at $45,000 and tentatively estimate the third package at $40,000.
Keep the price exactly the same.
To fully renegotiate all remaining SOWs from scratch.
Overall explanation
In a fixed-price work package arrangement, the vendor is expected to change the pricing of future work packages if more details are discovered that help them estimate better. The vendor can estimate the work packages, as the company could always decline to give them future work if desired. The vendor is not expected to keep the pricing the same if new information or risks are discovered. The vendor should not ever charge an average amount for work packages with varying prices. The vendor is not expected, nor are they required to renegotiate.

However, during the past few meetings, some team members have reported that they have not accomplished Krista's tasks. Upon further evaluation, Krista realizes that those members do not speak English as fluently as she believed. Krista also knows that other team members in those areas do speak English fluently based on past experiences with these individuals on other projects. What alternative can Krista suggest to improve understanding between team members who have not performed their assigned tasks?
Request for different team members who speak English fluently.
Correct answer
Ask team members who are collocated to attend virtual meetings together.
Hire a translator to attend the virtual meetings and clarify specific topics of discussion.
Use a different communication technology tool.
Overall explanation
Krista should request team members who are collocated to attend meetings together. This action will enhance communication for team members who do not speak fluent English and establish a sense of community for those team members. Hiring a translator is not an ideal answer as it can become very costly, especially if multiple translators need to be hired. Additionally, team members who speak numerous languages remove the need to hire a third party. Using another communication technology tool will not solve the root problem of this situation. Requesting for different team members may not be ideal as the team members on the team likely have the skills needed and are already part of the organization and project team.

As the project manager, due to a lack of physical observation, Olivia was struggling to identify the teamwork situation and project progress status on her project with a virtual team. She met with her team daily via video conferencing and requested that the team update their status on project assignments in a common project management tool. However, she noted that although all the team attended the video conference, only a few were consistently engaged in conversation. Although the team had a reporting mechanism for tasks, the updates were infrequent. Olivia developed a list of criteria to evaluate virtual interaction, which could be derived and measured using logging records of virtual collaboration interactions. Which of the following criteria provides the least insight for evaluating task quality, individual input, or risk of project outcomes?
Punctuality - during the review period, the number of tasks completed on time or within acceptable time delay.
Activity - number of task updates during the review period.
Meetings - number of meetings held to implement a task, the duration of meetings, number of participants, and results.
Correct answer
Questioning/Information sharing - number of email messages and chats held on specific issues.
Overall explanation
The number of email messages and responses is least insightful for evaluating task quality, individual input, or risk of project outcomes. Team members could send out many email messages with no value or real contribution to the project, so this is not the best choice. Meetings should be led at the start by Olivia to get more team members involved in the conversation and speaking with the entire team.

This project will utilize manufacturing equipment within the organization's inventory, so no costs for new equipment are needed. At a recent team meeting, Hilary heard two team members complaining that they do not understand how to use a specific piece of project equipment. What should Hilary do next?
Correct answer
Meet with the team and determine if training is required.
Request another team member to train the team members on the equipment.
Purchase different equipment that is easier for the team to use.
Send the two team members to specialized training.
Overall explanation
Before acting, Hilary should determine if training is needed, and if so, how long. She needs to understand the depth of training or coaching that is necessary for the two team members. The question does not tell you how difficult the equipment is to learn, so there is an assumption that training may be immediately needed. Hilary should determine what is needed before sending anyone to training or having another team member train someone. Procuring different equipment is likely not possible as the organization already has the equipment as part of its assets. Peer-to-peer training may be a valid choice, but only after Hilary first determines the depth of training that may be needed.

Which of the following categories would not be included in a project compliance plan?
Quality
Correct answer
Vision statement

A compliance management plan is a sub-plan of the project management plan, which needs to classify compliance categories, determine potential threats to compliance, analyze the consequences of non-compliance, and determine the critical approach and action to address compliance needs. The vision statement is the desired end-state, often described as a set of desired objectives and outcomes. Quality is conformance to the product requirements and creating a deliverable that is fit for use. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that may positively or negatively affect the project.

At the start of your project's execution, you identify an opportunity to lower your project's interest rate. Initially, the project had a future value of $4M with an interest rate of eight percent over two years. You were able to negotiate the interest rate down to five percent. What is the effect on the present value of your project?
Correct answer
The present value has increased by $199,000.
The present value has increased by $3,200,000.
The present value has increased by $3,800,000.
The present value has decreased by $199,000.
Overall explanation
The present value has increased by $199,000 based on the calculations for the present value. The present value is calculated by adding the interest rate to 1 and then exponentially multiplying this by the number of time periods. From here, the future value should be divided by this amount. Initially, the present value would have been about $3.429M. With the new interest rate, the present value is now about $3.629M. Therefore, the present value has increased by about $199,000.

The creation of a secured project repository that only certain stakeholders are allowed access to
Creating a project status report
Sending e-mails to certain project stakeholders
Correct answer
Hosting a project status meeting
Overall explanation
The correct answer is to host a project status meeting. Interactive communications are how stakeholders can communicate with each other. Three good examples of interactive communication are meetings, video conferences, and teleconferences. Creating a secured project repository that only certain stakeholders have access to is a pull communication in the form of a central repository, such as a reporting system. In order to pull information, the stakeholders would need to inquire with the central site. An e-mail is a type of push communication. The creation of a status report is not actual communication with stakeholders.

To investigate further, as it would be rare for a single methodology to be the right choice for every project.
Overall explanation
Because the most likely response is that Timothy will want to investigate further since a single project methodology is not often best in all circumstances. Timothy is likely, not delighted but more skeptical since it is very rare for agile to be appropriate in 100% of projects. Whether the teams think they are agile or not is irrelevant.

Lawrence needs to facilitate a decision from his team on a major issue facing them. It is important that the decision be as fast as possible and that the team members can show varying degrees of support. Lawrence makes sure to outline what each choice means before they vote. Lawrence is likely using the model called
Highsmith’s Decision Spectrum
Thumbs Up/Down/Sideways
Correct answer
Fist-of-Five Voting
Simple Voting
Overall explanation
This approach is the Fist-of-Five voting method, which allows for a quick decision, but also allows for team members to show varying levels of support. Simple Voting does not allow for the show of varying levels of support. Thumbs Up/Down/Sideways does not allow for the show of varying levels of support. Highsmith’s Decision Spectrum would not produce a quick decision.

As the project manager of the Beverly Project, Rue wants a vendor to agree to one price to do all the detailed work. What type of document does Rue need for this scenario?
A proposal
A request for proposal
Correct answer
An invitation for bid
An information request
Overall explanation
Rue is looking for an IFB (invitation to bid). This is generally a request for a sealed document stating the seller’s firm price to complete the detailed work. A proposal offers solutions to the buyer for completing the project’s needs; it does not state the price to complete the work. An information request is a document from the buyer requesting information from the seller about completing the work and is therefore incorrect. This response is incorrect because a proposal request requests information that the buyer seeks from the seller regarding work being completed.

Frank is a project manager who also covers the role of scrum master for a small agile team. The team is cross-functional, but two team members have a long history and some family ties. The two team members in question are not working well together, and they are working on things outside of the current sprint due to the conflict. Each team member is valuable to the project and difficult to replace, but this working method affects team morale and productivity. How should Frank address this conflict in the capacity of a project manager?
Avoid the problem. It may improve over time.
Force them to do what they are told.
Accommodate and just let them work as they like.
Correct answer
Compromise by working with each team member.
Overall explanation
Compromise by working with each team member is the best answer. By listening to concerns and working out positive solutions where everyone can win, you have the best chance at an improved outcome. Since the team members have a personal history, avoidance is unlikely to change the outcome. Accommodation will most likely cause friction with the other team members and slow the progress of the project. Forcing a resolution is unlikely to work because each team member is valuable and most likely has personal feelings toward the other, and this will cause resentment.

Avon is writing a memo to inform a sponsor and several stakeholders of an expected delay in his project. While the memo's direct purpose is to educate its recipients of the reason for the delay, the indirect goal is to prepare the recipients so that they will be more willing to increase the budget for Avon's project. Avon's team and peers are aware of the memo's contents but will not receive a copy. This is an example of what kind of communication?
Correct answer
Upward
Horizontal
Neutral
Downward
Overall explanation
As its name implies, upward communication flows to senior management, stakeholders, and sponsors higher in the company hierarchy than the project manager. Downward communication is directed to the project manager's team members, the people who will do the work. Horizontal communication is for peers of the project manager or the team itself. Neutral communication is not a hierarchically focused communication style used in most projects.

You are a project manager working on a project scheduled to complete one week before the deadline. You have four separate teams working on tasks. Two of the teams are utilizing the same resource but are trying to complete different tasks. While both tasks can be completed simultaneously, the resource only has the capacity for one task at a time. Neither team can agree on who should go first. How do you, as the project manager, best resolve this conflict?
Let the two team leaders decide who will go first.
Acquire a new resource that can assist with the task and accomplish both tasks simultaneously.
Let the resource decide which task to work on.
Correct answer
Look at the project schedule and determine which task will go first.
Overall explanation
As the project manager, it is important to maintain control of the project's progression and meet deadlines. If the two team leaders cannot resolve this independently, the project manager should decide which task will be completed next. Acquiring a new resource that can assist with the task and accomplish both tasks simultaneously is not the best choice, as you should first work with your team to resolve the current issue. There also may not be financial resources or time to procure additional help. Letting the resource decide which task to work on is not the best choice as the teams are in conflict over the order of tasks to be completed. Letting the two team leaders decide who will go first seems like a good answer, but it is apparent there is an issue already among the team to decide who will go first in the project work.

Another project manager asks if he can borrow one of Xiao's developers, James, to work on a different project that is just getting started. Xiao works out a plan with the project manager for how much time James will spend on each project manager's respective projects but does not inform James. Shortly after James starts on the new project, Xiao notices that he is not meeting her project deadlines. When she asks James about it, he becomes defensive and explains that he thought his role on Xiao's project had effectively ended. Xiao explains that she must prioritize her nearly complete project over the new project, but James responds that this will cause the new project to miss a deadline. What is the source of the conflict?
Personality
Cultural differences
Correct answer
Project priorities
Team environment
Overall explanation
Project priorities reflect the reality of competition for resources across multiple projects. Because organizations will often undertake many projects simultaneously and desire to use their resources efficiently, some resources will inevitably have competing commitments. Conflicts arising from team environments are related to team members not knowing each other well enough or having multiple bosses. Cultural differences can be a source of conflict if the way a group of team members does things differs significantly from another group's approach. Individual personalities may lead to conflict if they focus on interpersonal differences rather than technical issues.

Victoria is a project manager at Creation Corporation. While planning for her next project, she is approached by a stakeholder and asked to include several deliverables in the next project. Some of the stakeholders' suggestions go against some local laws that Victoria is familiar with for the project. What should Victoria do next?
Correct answer
Work with the stakeholder to change their ideas to be in compliance.
Ask the legal team how risky the suggestion is.
Report the stakeholder to Creation Corporation’s legal team.
Accept the stakeholder’s suggestions.
Overall explanation
Before doing anything else, Victoria should first work with the stakeholder to see if the tasks can be made compliant. This will help ensure the stakeholder gets what they need, and the project remains compliant with local laws. Reporting the stakeholder to the legal team will not help the project move forward and will negatively impact their relationship. Asking the legal team for a risk assessment is not the best option as other, compliant options may exist. Accepting the suggestions puts the project, and potentially Creation Corporation, at risk.

Katrina is a project manager overseeing the construction of a nuclear submarine at a shipbuilding company in the United States. An essential part of this construction comes from the engineers responsible for the design of the submarine. Key components are fabricated off-site and moved to the shipyard, where they are installed onto the submarines. The director has told Katrina that she needs to maintain good relations with the engineers, as their work is scarce to acquire in the country. What conflict management technique best describes what the director of the shipbuilding company requires from Katrina?
Correct answer
Smooth or accommodate
Force or direct
Compromise or reconcile
Collaborate, or problem-solve
Overall explanation
In this scenario, the shipbuilding company's director wants Katrina to use the smooth/accommodate conflict resolution technique. This technique involves emphasizing areas of agreement rather than places of difference. Additionally, the method requires Katrina to concede her position to the engineers' needs to maintain harmony between the two parties. Collaborate and problem-solve aims to find the best solutions in a spirit of cooperation, rather than finding a solution that will appease stakeholders. Forcing means that the person with the power makes the decision.Compromise means that both parties must give up something in the decision and is considered to be a lose-lose decision-making solution.

Facilitation
Correct answer
Active listening
Political awareness
Networking

Sid would love to find a balance between his love of being a project manager and spending time with his wife, children, and grandchildren. What is the best way to utilize Sid at this stage of his career?
Only give small projects to Sid.
Correct answer
Ask Sid to mentor young project managers.
Ask Sid to retire and just be an advisor.
Force Sid to retire.
Overall explanation
Sid would make a good advisor, but his contributions would be limited. Having Sid mentor younger project managers is a great solution. Sid will feel useful, involved, share his years of expertise with the next generation, and positively influence a wide array of projects. Forcing Sid to retire would mean the waste of a very valuable resource and Sid does not necessarily want to retire. Sid might be happier with smaller projects, which may help with his work-life balance, but he may feel not feel as useful, and his talents would be underutilized. Asking Sid to retire places him in a tough position and somewhat chooses for Sid, rather than allowing Sid to decide what is best for his life and ambitions. Asking Sid to mentor others shows respect and allows Sid to make the decision in his life.

What statement below best describes a project manager with a high degree of emotional intelligence?
A project manager with high emotional intelligence will more likely be overcome with emotions when a project gets too complex.
Individuals with high emotional intelligence will have a more challenging time making critical decisions.
Correct answer
Emotional intelligence and empathy are likely to be critical strengths in helping project managers successfully manage conflict.
The higher your emotional intelligence, the less likely you will be to manage conflict within your project team.
Overall explanation
A project manager with a high degree of emotional intelligence and empathy will likely manage conflict more successfully. The higher your emotional intelligence, the easier it is to spot and resolve situations that would otherwise lead to conflict. Higher emotional intelligence means a better understanding of emotions, not being overcome by emotions. People with higher emotional intelligence do not allow emotions unrelated to the decision to influence their decision, thus making better critical decisions.

The primary benefit is that the team typically achieves consensus around a solution. The coach’s time is not highly relevant to team collaboration, and this choice is not a strong primary benefit of this approach. Teams do not always end up in full agreement, and this choice is not a strong primary benefit of this approach.

Charlie is a scrum master for project AX, which is partially through its third iteration. Charlie has received feedback that a specific vendor, TechConsulting, provides sub-par services and is not meeting its requirements. TechConsulting has a large part in the project and poor performance presents a substantial risk. What should Charlie do?
Confront the vendor about providing poor services.
Complain to the product owner about the vendor's poor performance.
Correct answer
Review relevant contractual documents to determine if the vendor is not meeting their requirements.
Terminate the contract and find another vendor.
Overall explanation
Before Charlie can determine if TechConsulting is providing poor service, she should confirm what was agreed upon. Once she understands the original agreement, she will be in a better position to measure performance. The contract overrides everything else and should be reviewed to avoid assumptions in the project. Confronting the vendor without understanding what they should be provided will not help improve performance. Complaining to the product owner will not help resolve this situation. Terminating the contract will only slow the project as another vendor will have to be found.

Cost-plus incentive fee
Time and materials
Overall explanation
The correct response is a lump-sum contract, a fixed fee to complete the contract. The seller is responsible for any cost overruns. A cost-plus incentive fee contract requires the seller to carry the risk of cost overruns and is therefore incorrect. A time and materials contract is incorrect because this type of contract requires the buyer to pay for cost overruns on materials and the time invested in the project work.

Question 56

A project manager is working on a project spanning several years. Over time, the stakeholders responsible for guiding the project's deliverables have grown from two people to ten, all with varying engagement levels and influence toward the project and the organization. The project manager observes that the group's growth makes it more challenging to know what the project is meant to deliver, which in turn increases the likelihood of scope creep, missed timelines, and budget shortfalls. Moreover, meetings with the stakeholders tend to devolve into status updates rather than ways to gather information about the attributes of the project's deliverable. As a result, the project manager decides to update the ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. Notably, the project manager will facilitate a demonstration of the deliverables to date to ensure stakeholders' expectations align with the delivery's realities. If they do, the stakeholders will sign off on the deliverables; if not, stakeholders and the project team will develop written feedback for what needs to change, which they will likewise sign off on. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Correct answer
Requirements management
Politics and power structures
Characteristics of stakeholders
Analytical and assessment techniques
Overall explanation
Requirements management should be included in ground rules. Requirements management should be clearly defined in the scope management plan, including the change control process. From time to time, project managers can use their expert judgment to tailor the process if requirements are not being gathered correctly. Politics and power structures can inform ground rules but are inherently social rather than personal, and they may not have much to say about a formal process. Analytical and assessment techniques can be used to create ground rules but are most often used to identify problems rather than solve them. Stakeholder characteristics may need to be reflected in the project charter when describing stakeholder engagement. However, they are usually reflected in responses to specific stakeholders' needs or groups of stakeholders, not the project manager.

Which of the following options best describes what Ally is lacking according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs?
Correct answer
Physiological
Self-actualization
Safety
Esteem
Overall explanation
Due to Ally's situation, she lacks in her physiological needs. Physiological needs are the biological requirements for human survival, including sleep. As a result, Glenda was able to win in the negotiations of the project. Self-actualization needs are the highest level in Maslow's hierarchy and refer to the realization of a person's potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth, and peak experiences. Safety needs are a person's desire to experience order, predictability, and control in their lives. Esteem needs refer to both esteem for oneself and the desire for reputation or respect from others.

Sabrina starts to learn about SAFe, a framework for running multiple agile teams at once with a high coordination level. Her senior management likes Sabrina and trusts her, but it took several years to teach them about basic agile principles. What can Sabrina do to bring her senior management up to speed?
Correct answer
Bring in a SAFe trainer.
Send them an email on SAFe.
Nothing, she does not need them to be involved if they trust her.
Practice SAFe and let them see it in action.
Overall explanation
Bringing in a trainer who is well versed in this method of agile is a great choice. A trainer can share their enthusiasm and knowledge powerfully and succinctly and hopefully get everyone on board. Sabrina has the advantage of senior management that trusts her. Still, since they are not deeply involved in project management, they are not likely to understand SAFe or a similar framework without a proper presentation. Sabrina does need support and buy-in from management, so doing nothing is not a good option. An email may be ignored and leave management feeling frustrated. Introducing a new discipline and hoping that senior management gets on board down the road is not a great solution. Results are a great method to show how the approach works, but a better choice for immediate results is to offer a training class on the approach she is taking.

She has identified a contractor she would like to work with and now and must negotiate the terms. Which of the following is she likely to negotiate first?

Overall explanation
The scope should be evaluated and negotiated first because the price, schedule, and risks are dependent on the scope. Therefore, schedule, price, and risk should be negotiated after the scope. The schedule is not the first item to be negotiated, but the project scope must be determined to predict the project work duration. Price is based on the requirements of the project, which are defined in the project scope. Risk is often negotiated as it relates to its effect on time and cost, but the items in the requirements, the project scope, have a direct bearing on the risk of the project.

Overall explanation
Early after a team is formed, in the directing phase, the leader draws out a picture of what needs to be accomplished and helps directly with project activities.

Overall explanation
Formal communication in the form of reports, meetings, and presentations is typically polished and professional. External communication is for stakeholders outside of a project or organization, including customers and vendors. Internal communication focuses on stakeholders working on a given project or within the organization sponsoring a project. Informal communication, like email and ad hoc discussion, is informative but unstructured and may not be suitable for sharing outside of a select group of stakeholders.

Yoki prepared a matrix for her project that includes every communication deliverable, meetings, and timing of the needed communication. The matrix defines the method of communication, targeted stakeholders, the objective/tailored message, owner, feedback mechanism, security, confidentiality, and the method of evaluating effectiveness. This matrix aligns with the project's communication plan, approved by the project sponsor. What should Yoki do next?
Work with the project team to automate document workflows.
Incorporate the communication requirements into the team calendars.
Gain written approval from the project sponsor for the communication matrix.
Correct answer
Regularly review the matrix throughout the project lifecycle and adapt to the latest stakeholder information.
Overall explanation
Now that Yoki has created the matrix, she will periodically review the matrix and update it as needed based on the stakeholders' feedback and needs. Communication requirements do not go into the project team calendars. Automating document workflows is not clearly needed for the project or scenario presented. The project sponsor does not need to approve the communication matrix.

As the project manager for the Recycled Paper Corporation, you are leading an equipment upgrade project. The project is currently in its third month, and the team has been completing activities as planned. The work is of quality, the project is on schedule, and just slightly over project budget. Today, a key stakeholder has added a new piece of equipment to the project that he would like your team to install later in the project. The stakeholder reports that he will gladly pay for the costs and allot the needed time for the installation. Of the following choices, which one is the best choice you should consider as part of this change request?
Risks that the change will introduce
Vendor and procurement management
Correct answer
Integrated change control
Compliance and regulatory requirements
Overall explanation
All of the choices are good and valid concerns, but the best choice is integrated change control. All changes must pass through integrated change control. This process examines the effect of the proposed change on scope, schedule, costs, quality, human resources, communication, risk, procurement, and stakeholders. Risk will be examined as part of integrated change control, so this choice is incorrect. Compliance and regulatory requirements would be examined as part of integrated change control. Compliance and regulatory requirements are part of scope management, cost management, quality management, and other knowledge areas. Vendor and procurement management would be reviewed as part of integrated change control.

You are a project manager for your organization. Your project has a BAC of $250,000 and is expected to last ten months. Currently, the project is in month six and is 40 percent complete, but the project was expected to be 60 percent complete by this time. You have spent $125,000 to complete the work. What is the schedule performance index of the project?
Correct answer
0.67
$80,000
0.8
$67,000
Overall explanation
The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. In this instance, the formula is $100,000 / 150,000 = 0.67. .80 is the value of the cost performance index. SPI is a decimal amount, not a dollar amount. The SPI is not a dollar amount.

Tracey is a scrum master for the development of a mobile application. Tracey facilitates the team's fortnightly sprint retrospective and has requested his team members to fill out a Trello board on what went well, what could be improved, and any actions that the team can improve upon in subsequent sprint processes. What term best describes what a sprint retrospective is considered in a standard project?
Reviewing
Correct answer
Debriefing
Auditing
Quality assurance
Overall explanation
Debriefing is a more general term for what a sprint retrospective is meant to achieve. Debriefing is a less formal, more cooperative means of discussing the project's positives and negatives, what worked, and what will be done differently next time. This discussion includes technology issues, people issues, vendor relationships, and organizational culture. An audit is not a scrum term and is usually associated with an inspection of an organization's financial records or the security infrastructure. Reviewing is not a scrum term and does not fully define the retrospective. A review also hints at the sprint review, which demonstrates what the team has created. Quality assurance is a management-driven process to prevent mistakes from entering the project.

Erik plans to sponsor a new project in his department, but he receives another job offer prior to its inception. The stakeholders at Erik's former company decide that they do not need to replace him on the project, preferring to let the seasoned project team work without supervision since they do not understand the project's nature but support it anyway. During the first milestone review meeting, the stakeholders decide that the project is not what they thought it was and tell the project manager to put it on hold indefinitely. What is the root cause of the misunderstanding?
Lack of active listening
Correct answer
Lack of leadership
Lack of stakeholder management
Lack of cultural awareness
Overall explanation
A lack of leadership occurs when there is no vision or inspiration to run the project correctly. The departure of a sponsor and the subsequent choice not to replace them led to a lack of shared understanding among the remaining employees and stakeholders. A lack of active listening occurs when teams do not reflect stakeholder statements in their own words to confirm understanding or solicit additional information. A lack of cultural awareness generally occurs when people from different backgrounds overlook contextual clues that might be obvious to people from the same background. A lack of stakeholder management stems from allowing stakeholders to overstep the boundaries necessary for successfully completing a project. In this case, this root cause is not as impactful as a lack of leadership.

At this stage of the project, Sheena and her team are performing activity duration estimates, and they also need to review the appropriate tools and techniques for use with this process. In the process of activity duration estimation, which of the following is not a tool or technique?
Analogous estimating

The most significant way that stakeholder management in an agile project differs from that done in a traditional project is:
Stakeholders are a much smaller group, so managing is easier.
It is focused on letting the team decide what they want to tell the stakeholders.
It focuses only on communicating information via information radiators.
Correct answer
It is not focused on telling people what they should do and controlling their tasks.
Overall explanation
Agile stakeholder management is less based on controlling and managing and more focused on stewardship. Agile methods do not require that the team decides on what to tell stakeholders. Communication is never limited to information radiators, as it is preferred to be face-to-face. There is also no implication that the stakeholder group would be smaller or easier to handle.

As the agile team leader, Hugo has viewing access to the project's budget. As the team makes progress through its iterations, Hugo notices that project costs continue to increase. What could be the cause of this?
An increase of hours worked, with no explanation
Correct answer
Technical debt
Scope creep
The team has added testers
Overall explanation
The best answer choice here is technical debt, the backlog of things that should be done but are not. They are not done because of a rush to deliver features: regular cleanup and maintenance and refactoring. Because these tasks need to be done at some point, the cost of development in future iterations is increased. Factoring the time it takes to complete maintenance during the iteration is much more efficient than doing it at some other time in the project. The other responses are incorrect. Hours are mapped against each user story; the question does not state that additional testers have been added to the project team; small, undocumented changes that enter a project are what defines scope creep.

Correct answer
The project management office recognized a mentoring opportunity.

The project management office wants to keep an eye on the junior project manager.
The junior project manager likes Kelly.
Overall explanation
The project management office most likely identified this as an opportunity for Kelly to mentor a more junior project manager. Keeping an eye on Kelly is not a valid option for this scenario and does not promote trust in the project. Keeping an eye on the junior project manager is not valid and does not promote trust in the project. The junior project manager liking Kelly is not a valid reason for mentoring and would be considered wasteful for the project's time and money.

Wanda is the scrum master for Project O, seven iterations into its deployment, and has a velocity of 53 story points. During a recent team meeting, several team members were at odds with each other regarding how to best proceed with a specific problem. Wanda resolved the conflict, but now the project's velocity has slipped 14 points. What is the most likely cause for the lost productivity?
Without a common conflict, the team is not motivated.
Several team members left the team.
The team has completed the backlog and does not have enough work.
Correct answer
Wanda used the wrong strategy to resolve this conflict.
Overall explanation
Selecting the wrong conflict resolution technique can negatively impact a team's productivity. Forcing an issue, for example, may result in the team resenting the project manager and not working as hard. A common conflict can help the team stay motivated, but this is not the most likely cause. An empty backlog is not the most likely cause, given the recent conflict. Missing team members would not be the most likely cause, given the recent conflict.

Donald is a project manager at Alpha Construction. He has been asked to, by any means necessary, shorten the length of his project by six weeks. In response, Donald adds more resources to the team and approves an unlimited amount of overtime. He knows that, by doing this, he risks possible conflicts, more management time, and additional funds being needed for the project. What is the name of the technique Donald is using?
Fast-tracking
Correct answer
Crashing
Critical chain
Critical Path
Overall explanation
The correct answer is crashing, a technique used to add resources to a project to finish it faster. Adding more resources, costs, management and approval of overtime are examples of crashing. Crashing can increase project risk and does not always produce the desired results. Fast-tracking allows phases of the project to overlap and can increase project risks. The critical path is the longest path in a project network diagram and helps to expose float on the non-critical path activities. Critical chain is a project network diagramming approach that utilizes buffers in lieu of float on project activities.

After two weeks, the group presents a minimum viable product (MVP) to a local gaming store owner. The owner provides constructive feedback on the game, stating that it is too complicated to understand. Which component of the AEIOU (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users) Framework is the most likely reason why the game was considered too complicated to understand?
Correct answer
Users
Environments
Objects
Interactions
Overall explanation
The product owner and team did not understand the requirements of the end-user. As stated in the problem, the team developed 50 user stories while not consulting with the customers. One of the critical agile principles says that simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential. The 'Objects' portion of the AEIOU framework discusses the objects and devices people have in their environments and how they relate to their activities. The 'Interactions' portion describes the relations between people and things in their environment and across distances. The 'Environments' part describes the character and function of the space; overall, the individual's spaces and of shared spaces.

Emelia knows that the project team has been working hard, but some stakeholders are concerned that some team members are not putting in as much time as others. Emelia disagrees with this assessment. What should Emelia do next?
Correct answer
Create and publish regular reports on the project status.
Refer the stakeholders to the project management information system (PMIS).
Privately reassure those stakeholders that her team is working hard.
Tell the team that their stakeholders are watching and to work harder.
Overall explanation
Creating and publishing regular reports on the project status is the best choice. Not all team members may be working the same amount of hours on the project at all times. Different tasks and skillsets will be needed throughout the project, so a uniform approach to labor utilization is not always practical. The primary concern of the stakeholders should be project progression, not the amount of hours the team members are working. Privately reassuring stakeholders that her team is working hard is a good thing to do, but the better choice is to present evidence that the project is progressing as planned. Referring the stakeholders to the project management information system (PMIS) is not a good choice, as this software may require special permission and training. This also does not directly address the stakeholders' concerns about the project's progress. To tell the team that their stakeholders are watching and to work harder is not a good choice. The team is working as planned and they do not need additional stress in the project.

Brandon uses a standard graduated fixed-price contract for his work with Gwaltney Software. If Gwaltney charges $175 per hour if they finish on time, what rate are they most likely to charge if they finish late?
$190
$175
Correct answer
$160
There is insufficient information to determine a possible rate.
Overall explanation
Because Gwaltney is expected to charge less per hour if they finish late as an incentive for on-time delivery, so $160 is the most reasonable choice for a graduated fixed-price contract. A standard graduated fixed-price contract includes a lower rate for late delivery, so keeping the amount the same at $175 would not be an appropriate choice. A standard graduated fixed-price contract includes a lower rate for late delivery, so increasing the amount to $190 would not be an appropriate choice.

What has Mark failed to address in managing the project artifacts so that the same issues are not repeated?
Updating the project management plan with training requirements.
Coordination of additional training.

Project managers are responsible for ensuring that project artifacts are up to date. In this case, the issue log should have been updated to keep track of the issue and ensure it is resolved and not repeated. Once this has been done, Mark will need to carry out a root-cause analysis and take appropriate corrective actions. Coordination of additional training is needed, but Mark should first update the issue log to document the problem, look for a solution, and then apply corrective actions.

Your project management office has presented you with Project A, which has a present value of $1.2M. You must decide if this project will be more valuable than an existing Project Z, with a future value of $1.4M and an interest rate of 10 percent over two years. Which project is more valuable?
Correct answer
Project A is more valuable as it has a higher present value.
Project Z is more valuable as it has a higher present value.
Project Z is more valuable as it has a higher internal rate of return.
Project A is more valuable as it has a higher internal rate of return.
Overall explanation
Project A has a higher present value. The present value is calculated by first adding 1 to the interest rate and then exponentially multiplying this value by the number of time periods. For Project Z, this gives us (.1.2) ^2. Then, this value should be divided by the future value. For project Z, the future value is $1.4M. This leads to a present value of about $1.15M for Project Z.

She is asking her senior colleague for advice. Which option is the most appropriate tool selection for managing change and configuration requests from the list below?
Must be manual; a complex project requires all change requests to be manually approved.
Correct answer
Manual or automatic; the selection depends on the environment and requirements.
Must be automatic; a complex project requires complex change control procedures.
Configuration control must be manual, but change control may be automatic.
Overall explanation
A large, complex project should be flexible with change requests where some changes are granted automatically and other changes go through a manual review process. Configuration change management can be conducted with the use of manual or automated tools. The selection of resources, tools, and applications is tailored to the project's needs and availability within the performing organization. Automatic management of change requests could be a predetermined approval or declined status for certain types of changes. Examples include changes that affect a particular deliverable, duration to implement the change, or a cost factor. Configuration control must be manual, but change control may be automatic is not a valid answer. Must be manual; a complex project that requires all change requests to be manually approved is not an accurate statement as some change requests could be automated.

Sending a hand-written note is a nice gesture but will not help with engagement among the project team. Moving the team to a separate, safe site would be prohibitively expensive and may be counterproductive to combating the illness in the pandemic. Telling the team to ignore the situation will not help improve morale or engagement.

Lynn is the project manager for Project JKG that is on schedule but slightly over budget. Lynn is preparing a series of reports for the key stakeholders and wants to ensure each stakeholder receives a report tailored to their needs. In addition to the project status, what else should Lynn consider in her reports?
How long each stakeholder has been involved in the project
How much she personally likes each stakeholder
Correct answer
Each stakeholder's feelings towards the project
How long it has been since the last status update
Overall explanation
Lynn should consider how each stakeholder feels about the project, as these feelings will impact how they will perceive updates. Stakeholders who support the project will interpret information differently than those who oppose the project. How long a stakeholder has been involved should not impact the way Lynn prepares the reports. The time between status reports may be an issue more than it is a consideration for what is included in the report. There is an assumption in the question that the project manager is following a communication schedule and delivering the reports as promised. How much Lynn likes each stakeholder should not be a factor in her status reporting.

Paula works for a baby diaper company that is aiming to add cloth diapers to its sales. However, one of the company's leading suppliers of plastics products is not happy with this decision because they will lose a significant amount of business if the project is completed successfully. What action should Paula take to further engage with the plastics products supplier?
Monitor
Manage closely
Keep informed
Correct answer
Keep satisfied
Overall explanation
Paula should keep the plastic supplier satisfied. This group of stakeholders is classified as having high power as they provide the plastic that contributes to a large amount of the company's business. The supplier has a low interest in the project as the project succeeding will result in a loss of business. Paula should work with the supplier to fulfill the contractual obligations but not be excessive in communications. Stakeholders who should be managed closely have high power and high interest in the project. Stakeholders who should be monitored have low power and low interest in the project and should not be bored with excessive communication. Stakeholders who should be kept informed have low power but high interest to avoid significant issues from arising.

Sandra is the scrum master for a project that is just starting its first iteration. During a recent meeting with stakeholders, Sandra overhears one of them complain that they missed the deadline for adding a feature to the project's scope. What is Sandra's best response to this comment?
The stakeholder will have to convince the product owner the idea is important.
Invite the stakeholder to the next sprint review.
The stakeholder is correct. Once the project begins, the scope is locked in.
Correct answer
The stakeholder can add the item to the backlog at any time.
Overall explanation
In an agile environment, anyone may add items to the project's backlog at any time. It is up to the product owner to determine their priority. There is no requirements deadline when adding to the backlog. Agile projects are designed to have a flexible scope, so they will not be locked when the project begins. The product owner is in charge of prioritizing items, not deciding which goes into the backlog. Sprint reviews are intended to share updates made in the prior iteration.

In an effective agile vendor contract, if the customer uses the same vendor throughout the project and then chooses to reprioritize the backlog, the vendor is expected to:
Renegotiate the contract to include the new changes.
Formally break the contract.
Correct answer
Charge nothing extra for the changes if they do not increase the amount of work.
Complete a formal change control process where the entire team must approve the change
Overall explanation
If there is no change to the work volume, typical agile contracts accommodate changes as long as the overall amount of work does not increase. If the total amount of work does not change, there is no need to renegotiate the contract. Agile projects do not require a formal change control process with full team approval. If the total amount of work does not change, there is no need to break the contract.

None of the above.
Remind the team that agile methodology should not vary from the original concepts provided to the team.
Correct answer
Welcome the new path if the team feels like it is a good solution.
Get approval from the project sponsor before changing anything fundamental to their agile process.
Overall explanation
Julia should welcome the new path if the team agrees, assuming they have mastered the existing agile process, as they have been together quite a while. The team has been together a long time, so it is appropriate to consider modifications if the team agrees. There is no requirement for sponsor approval. None of the above is an incorrect answer to this question.

This action will require the shutting down of over fifty local branches, including Heather's jurisdiction area. As Heather is currently working on a project of her own and is 80% complete, what action should she take to adapt to the shift in organizational strategic objectives?
Write a letter of intent to the Board of Directors on why her project needs to continue.
Notify her team members that they may lose their jobs.
Continue working on her current project as she only has 20% left to complete.
Correct answer
Evaluate the impact of the organizational change on her project and determine required actions.

Heather needs to assess how the organizational change will impact her current project and determine the required actions based on this assessment. If she continues working on her current project, she may not complete it in time due to the new changes to the organization. While Heather might write a letter of intent to the board of directors, this should only be done after assessing the organizational changes to her project.

Josh is a scrum master at the Acme Corporation. During a recent sprint, he noticed that some of the junior developers made some mistakes that, while not critical, had the potential to endanger the deployment of some features. What should Josh do to help avoid this in the future?
Privately chat with each member and explain what they need to do better.
Correct answer
Blamelessly, bring up the mistakes at the retrospective and walk through ways to avoid them.
Report the mistakes to the Project Management Office.
Say nothing. But record the mistakes in the event that they happen again.
Overall explanation
Blamelessly exposing these mistakes and having the team understand how to avoid them will hold the developers accountable and build their skillset. This will also foster psychological safety and encourage individuals to ask for help. Privately chatting with each individual will not help the overall group improve. Reporting the mistakes to the Project Management Office will not help the overall group improve. Saying nothing robs these individuals of an improvement.

A project requirement dispute has divided your team. The agile team leader, Avi, has not taken action to resolve this disagreement. In fact, Avi has been keeping his distance. Why would Avi be doing this?
Correct answer
Avi wants his team first to try resolving the differences themselves.
Avi does not know how to solve the dispute or find a correct resolution to the problem.
Avi is waiting for the team to blow up before he intervenes.
On one side of the dispute is a friend of Avi’s.
Overall explanation
If the disagreement is still at a manageable level, an effective agile leader will evaluate the level of disagreement and let the team resolve the issue without his assistance. This approach builds trust and respect among the team members, as well as support of the resolution. This answer is incorrect because if a team attempts to be self-guided and resolve their own issues, an agile leader is not expected to intervene; this scenario does not indicate that Avi does not know how to solve the dispute or find a correct resolution to the problem. An agile leader needs to take emotion out of their involvement and not take sides based on friendship, no matter who is on the team. The agile leader believes conflict is often good but must intervene before disagreements spiral out of control.

Jackson oversees two talented software developers who also happen to be highly competitive and fiercely independent. This often results in excellent products delivered on time. Occasionally, however, the two developers end up working on different solutions to the same problem. In these cases, Jackson's team suffers due to the duplication of effort, which leaves other tasks unattended. The developers talk to each other but often overlook opportunities to work together. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by
Creating team-building opportunities
Using open and effective comminucation
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Correct answer
Encouraging collaborative problem-solving
Overall explanation
Not all problems require collaboration, but in some cases, collaboration is necessary simply to keep different team members apprised of what everyone is working on. This is not a time-consuming process- a simple call at the start of the day is usually enough to keep things on track. Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance, but this is more crucial at the early stages of team development and will have limited benefit if a mature team is overlooking the fact that they are working past each other. Mentoring centered on managing is not applicable in this case since there are no conflicts, only a lack of awareness. Open and effective communications is a good second choice, as the two developers should communicate with each other, but the best solution is for the developers to collaborate. Note that the two developers are communicating with one another, but they should be working together too.

Melissa has allowed this to continue for a few days in the hopes the developers would reconcile, but their behavior has not changed. What should Melissa do?
At the next daily standup, remind the entire team about the importance of teamwork.
Correct answer
Meet with the developers separately to understand the source of their disagreement.
Remove the developers from the project team.
Report the developers to the product owner.
Overall explanation
Something happened to cause the developers to stop working together. Melissa should understand the root cause and then work towards a solution that will allow the team to continue working together. Reporting the developers to the product owner will not help improve the situation. Removing the developers does not address the root cause and will negatively impact the project.

She has noticed that every team meeting begins with the project manager, Tommy, reviewing a set of rules and best practices that the team has all agreed to follow. She is confused that this is reviewed during every meeting and asks Tommy why he does this. How is Tommy likely to respond?
Correct answer
Tommy wants to keep the rules fresh in everyone's mind to help them remember and follow them.
Tommy does not trust the team to remember these rules, so he constantly reminds them.
A stakeholder is concerned the team is not performing well and punishing them.
Reviewing these rules at every meeting is a standard practice of the Acme Corporation.
Overall explanation
By reviewing these rules every meeting, Tommy is helping to establish them as expected behavior. This also opens opportunities for a dialog around the team's standards, practices and encourages positive behavior. Reviewing these rules does not mean that Tommy has trust issues with the team. A stakeholder would not take direct action within the team. Given Sally's experience at Acme, she knows this is not standard practice.

Emily is a developer on a project which just completed its third iteration, is slightly under budget, and has a velocity of 36 story points. During the previous sprint, the team learned that several pieces of equipment needed to complete the project would become available sooner than expected. When Emily reviews the backlog during the next sprint planning session, what changes will she likely find?
Emily will not notice any changes to the backlog.
Correct answer
Stories related to this equipment are higher in priority than before.
Exactly 36 story points of work will appear in the backlog.
Only stories related to the equipment will appear in the backlog.
Overall explanation
Having this equipment available sooner means the project schedule needs to shift. In agile, this can be as straightforward, as prioritizing tasks related to the equipment are now higher than they were before in this scenario. Given the need for this equipment, it is unlikely Emily will not see any changes. While this equipment may be necessary, it is highly unlikely the product owner would remove unrelated tasks. While it is possible only 36 story points of work remain, this is highly unlikely.

Herzberg's Theory of Motivation states that hygiene agents, such as a paycheck, will not motivate people, but their absence will demotivate. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs identifies the seven needs we all pursue. Ouchi's Theory Z is based on the Japanese management style.

Jenny decides she needs to speak with the key stakeholders to speak with them about her role in the project and get a sense of their attitude towards the project. Jenny quickly learns that the different groups of stakeholders are not speaking with one another, though they need to collaborate on the project requirements. Each group refuses to attend meetings with the other group, and any interaction escalates quickly. What should Jenny do next in this situation?
Invite both parties to one meeting and tell them they must work together.
Correct answer
Meet with each group separately to understand the source of their conflict.
Escalate the situation to the project management office.
Do nothing. Eventually, they will realize the need to work together.
Overall explanation
Understanding the source of the conflict will help Jenny determine strategies for working with both groups. Until improvements can be made, "shuttle diplomacy" may be necessary. Jenny needs to work with what she has inherited, understand the project challenges, and work through the breakdown in stakeholder collaboration. Escalating to the project management office may not help address the source of the conflict and can delay improvement. Both parties have expressed that they refuse to meet with the other group. Jenny telling them that they must work together without understanding the issue and feelings is not likely to move the project forward. Ignoring this conflict is not beneficial for the project as the two groups need to collaborate on the project and its requirements.

Schedule interviews
Organize various focus group meetings.
Correct answer
Send an online questionnaire
Update the project's website with summary notes collected during the information session.
Overall explanation
Questionnaires are the most effective method to reach a large audience and gather information quickly. Because timing is urgent, an online questionnaire or survey can offer quick feedback from the community. Interviews would not be feasible in this scenario based on the project's size and fast turnaround requirements. Based on the large size of the project and the fast turnaround time required, focus groups are not feasible, making this option incorrect.

In preparation for something possibly going wrong, many team members want to bloat the time for certain activities to have enough time to complete their tasks. These tasks may suffer from which of the following laws of economics?
Correct answer
Parkinson's Law
Hertzberg's theory of motivation
The law of diminishing returns
Oligopoly
Overall explanation
Parkinson's Law, which says that work will expand to fulfill the time allotted, is the correct answer. Tasks that are bloated will take all of the allotted time. Instead, management reserve should be used. Hertzberg's theory of motivation is incorrect because it describes the personalities and motivation of workers. An oligopoly is a procurement issue in which there are few available vendors to choose from and is an incorrect response. In addition, vendors may have checks and balances with one another. The law of diminishing returns is incorrect because it defines the relationship between effort, duration, and maximum yield.

Issue log
Requirements documentation
Stakeholder engagement plan

The project has a budget of $10,000 and is expected to last two months. Arya is excited to take on the project and informs her friend who works in the human resource department. However, her friend has little influence or interest in the new type of paper. What stakeholder management strategy should Arya utilize for her friend?
Correct answer
Monitor her friend's actions.
Keep her friend satisfied.
Manage her friend closely.
Keep her friend informed.
Overall explanation
In a typical power/interest grid, Arya's friend falls under a low-power/low-interest stakeholder category. For this reason, Arya should only monitor her friend's actions. Although Arya's friend may not be interested now, the new paper directly affects her friend's mode of work, thus changing her status to that of a low power/high-interest stakeholder. It is important to manage closely high power/high interest stakeholders. It is important to keep informed a low-power/high-interest stakeholder category.

Ruth and the other team members have discussed ways to avoid any further communication failures that could hinder the project. The team decides that they should bring the matter to the project manager, Beth. What are ways that Beth could help the team become more effective in communication?
Call a meeting to discuss ways that deadlines are essential to job security, and better communication is a must to meet those deadlines.
Restructure the team where the most efficient person at communication becomes the one responsible for all communication.
Correct answer
Assign a facilitator within the team to ensure effective participation and communication, which allows for full buy-in for the agreements and actions to be dealt with following the decision process established for the project.
Incorporate open networking forums with specialists that would allow team members to post questions for knowledge sharing.
Overall explanation
With Beth assigning a facilitator, she ensures that all the team members actively participate and communicate with each other. This ensures that all contributions are considered and the results are agreed upon, allowing for a successful conclusion or solution. Posting questions and answers is a fine choice, but the best answer is face-to-face communication and gaining buy-in for the actions the team decides upon. All team members should be good at communication, not just one person. This approach also may cause challenges as the central communicator will be communicating with other team members who may not be good at communication. In addition, the team member selected may have other responsibilities to complete and may not have the time for this additional assignment. Threatening the team to be better communicators will not necessarily make the team better communicators. Action needs to be taken, but only the correct action can solve the issue.

With this project so close to the finish line, Cindy is worried that his attitude will alter the project or infect the other team members with a similar mindset. How should Cindy handle this problematic project team member?
Remove him from the team.
Correct answer
Smooth his concerns.
Force him to be quiet and work.
Avoid the problem as the project is almost done anyway.
Overall explanation
Since Cindy is close to completing the project, smoothing things over with the team member seems like a great solution. If she can keep him happy for a season, she can keep his attitude from spreading to the rest of the team. If she retains him for the next project, she can do more in-depth work with him. However, for now, her goal is to complete this project. Cindy is close to the finish line, so removing a team member and short-handing the project team or replacing him is not a great solution. A forceful approach could create more problems and resentment. Although Cindy could avoid the problem, if she does so, the problem could build and make bigger problems for her at an inopportune time.

Chuck has been assigned as a cost engineer to build a car park near a major airport. He has been tasked with quickly determining the project's costs, so his supervisor can report promptly to some high-profile stakeholders to get the project underway. What estimation technique would be best applied in this scenario?
Bottom-up estimating
Correct answer
Analogous estimating
Parametric estimating
Three-point estimating
Overall explanation
Chuck should use analogous estimating in this case. Analogous estimating involves using values, or attributes, of a previous project similar to the current project. The project's values and attributes may include but are not limited to scope, cost, budget, duration, and measures of scale. Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical knowledge and another variable. Bottom-up estimating involves estimating the costs of individual work packages or activities to the most significant level of specified detail. Three-point estimating takes the average of the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic costs.

To ensure her project team completes all the steps of the install procedure with quality, which of the following should Sandra implement?
Correct answer
Checklists
PND
The WBS Dictionary
WBS
Overall explanation
The correct response is checklists, defined as simple but effective management tools that project managers use to ensure their team is finishing the required work. The WBS Dictionary is not a tool that the project team can use to show they've completed the required work and is therefore incorrect. The best approach for this scenario is checklists. PND is incorrect because it is not a tool that team members typically use to show they have finished the required work. The best response for this scenario is checklists.

Roger has been working on a project to upgrade the HVAC system within a building. The project is divided into five phases. The project has just completed its second phase, and the stakeholders are ready to transition into the next phase. Which of the following steps should Roger take next?
Correct answer
Identify stakeholders.
Manage project knowledge.
Monitor and control project work.
Perform the process of closing the project or phase.
Overall explanation
Roger should identify his stakeholders for the next phase. Identifying stakeholders first occurs during the project charter development. The process of identifying stakeholders should be repeated at the beginning of each phase. All relevant documentation should be updated to reflect the changing stakeholders each time they are identified. In this scenario, the project's second phase has just been completed, so the closing out of the phase should have already been completed, making this an invalid answer choice. Managing project knowledge typically occurs during the executing phase of a project. Monitoring and controlling project work occur while the project or phase is being conducted.

Georgette is the project manager for Tufts Logistics. She and her team disagree about the amount of time it takes to complete certain activities. In the occurrence of schedule changes due to risk events, some team members want to bloat the time of certain activities to ensure they will have enough time to complete their tasks. Which of the following should the project team use instead of underestimating their project activities?
Correct answer
Contingency reserve
Assume plus or minus a percentage
Contingency plans
Capital reserve
Overall explanation
Instead of bloating activities, Georgette and her team should use a contingency reserve, a part of the project schedule used for activity overruns. Contingency plans are defined as a reaction to situations of risk and are therefore incorrect. The assumption of plus or minus a percentage is incorrect because it describes a range variance. Capital reserves are an incorrect answer because it does not describe the above scenario.

You are the scrum master for a cross-functional project team that is having significant problems. The various technical groups are not in agreement with the approach to developing the software solution. What should you do next to move the cross-functional team forward?
Accept that most cross-functional project teams run into this. Therefore, you should let the team resolve it within one iteration. After one iteration, you will need to intervene and set the required direction.
Inform upper management of the issue you are having with the cross-functional team and ask for guidance to resolve the issue.
Correct answer
Communicate to the different functional groups that their expertise is essential, and you trust them; however, they must work together to keep the project moving forward.
Schedule a team-building exercise with the cross-functional team to help them work through some of the team's issues.
Overall explanation
The team is self-led and self-directing in a scrum project, so you need to coach the team but not direct them to a solution. Trust and transparency are needed among the team, including the scrum master. There is no predetermined deadline to resolve a disagreement among the team, so this choice is not correct. A team-building exercise can be helpful, but this is not the best course of action presented. You do not ask management to resolve this issue in scrum, but instead, coach the team on their responsibilities, rather than take a command-and-control approach to the project.

You are a project management consultant for an organization that markets other businesses online. Your teammate, Dan, has expressed his interest in mentoring a junior developer. He asks you what the most important element of a successful mentorship is. What would you tell him?
Your mentee must be your direct report.
Correct answer
A trusting relationship between the mentor and mentee is critical.
You must have the technical expertise to ensure that your mentee will learn from you.
You must be able to commit several hours a week to mentorship.
Overall explanation
The most important element to a successful mentorship is a trusting relationship between the mentor and mentee. Technical expertise is not a requirement of mentorship. A mentor can demonstrate any kind of quality, for example, professionalism, that a mentee can learn. Mentorship is not restricted to a supervisor and direct report relationship; it can exist between any individual.

Keith is the scrum master for an automotive industry software team working on improving the anti-lock brake system. It is a yearlong project with a quarterly release cycle, each comprising three sprints of a month time box. Halfway through the current sprint, the key stakeholder calls Keith into a meeting and explains that the competitive market has shifted, and the team's product is no longer viable. What is the best thing for Keith to do next?
Work with the team to re-prioritize the backlog.
Correct answer
Check with the product owner to see if the viability of the project has changed.
Prepare the team to be assigned to a new project.
Cancel the sprint.
Overall explanation
In this question, it is vital to understand the agile roles and their responsibilities. The only person who has the information needed to assess the project's viability is the product owner. The product owner is also the sole person responsible for managing the product backlog and maximizing the product's value resulting from the development team's work. Therefore, the scrum master should connect with the product owner and ask if the project is still viable to continue. The development team or the scrum master cannot re-prioritize the backlog directly without the product owner's consent. The scrum master will not prepare the team for a new project, that will come from their managers, the project sponsor, or other entities. In addition, the scrum master should first meet with the product owner to understand the situation. The scrum master cannot cancel the sprint.

Jane has been assigned to lead a distributed agile team. Being an experienced agile project manager, Jane knows that agile project management approaches value face-to-face communication as the best way to convey information. However, it can be challenging for distributed teams since not all team members are in the same physical space. To help them communicate, what is the best option for Jane?
Define common working hours so everyone in the team can better communicate.
Ask the team to follow a common language for all project communications.
Inform the team members to share photos of themselves.
Correct answer
Set up a few initial face-to-face meetings for everyone to meet and get introduced.
Overall explanation
For distributed teams, setting up some initial face-to-face meetings for everyone on the team to meet is proven to be the best and most effective strategy to improve virtual and remote communication later in the project. It is easier for a team to connect and follow up with an email or phone call once they have met face-to-face. Asking the team to follow a common language might be helpful but can be viewed as rigid and disrespectful. Sending photos is unlikely to assist more in this scenario and is certainly not the best option to follow. Defining common working hours might be helpful but can be viewed as rigid and disrespectful.

Cost-plus percentage of cost
Cost-plus incentive fee
Cost-plus-fixed-fee
Correct answer
Fixed-price
Overall explanation
A fixed-price contract contains the least amount of project risk and is the correct response. Cost overruns are the responsibility of the seller; therefore, the seller absorbs all the risk. A cost-plus incentive fee contract runs the risk of cost overruns being assumed by the buyer and is therefore incorrect. A cost-plus percentage of cost contract is incorrect because it carries the risk of cost overruns being absorbed by the buyer. A contract that is a cost-plus-fixed-fee carries the risk of cost overruns being assumed by the buyer and is therefore incorrect.

Speak to the technical design team and determine who the key stakeholders are and if they are happy with the team's progress so far.
Reassess the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix and add missing stakeholders.
Review the communication management plan and ensure the stakeholder register is current.
Correct answer
Examine the power/influence grid, and understand what motivates them. But George must become familiar with the stage in which the project is in advance.
Overall explanation
The power/interest grid maps out the stakeholders and their influence on the projects; however, since the interest of each stakeholder and their influence may change over time, George must understand the current stage of the project first. A review of the communication management plan and stakeholder register to ensure that they are current will not help George in this scenario because he is trying to understand the influence of stakeholders on the overall project. Reassessing the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix to ass missing stakeholders will not help George because he is trying to understand the influence of stakeholders on the overall project. Speaking to the technical team is not ideal for determining stakeholders' influence due to their limited involvement with external stakeholders.

Darren decides that the resource they share needs training in the latest version control system. This training will benefit Darren's project but is unlikely to benefit the functional manager's workstream. How should Darren allocate resources for training?
Use funding from the functional manager's budget.
With the functional manager's knowledge but without their approval.
Correct answer
With the functional manager's knowledge and approval.
Without the functional manager's knowledge or approval.
Overall explanation
In a matrix environment, the functional and project managers must jointly share human resources and decisions regarding an employee's activities. Since the employee is being shared, resources for training should also be shared. Darren cannot schedule training from the functional manager's budget without approval from the functional manager. Scheduling training without a functional manager's knowledge, approval, or both is likely to cause disagreement, as is opportunistically using one department's funding. Darren must have approval from the functional manager to use the funds.

Once the project begins, the scope is locked so that changes may be ignored.
Only the project manager can approve changes.

All changes should be vetted through a change control process.
Overall explanation
All changes to a project must go through a formal change control process to ensure changes to scope do not negatively impact the project.

Scott must educate the customer because the customer does not know project management.
The customer will complete Scott's performance evaluation, and poor communication will negatively affect his bonus.

A positive relationship between Scott and the customer allows for more precise project communication on the objectives than what may be expressed in the contract. The contract should be the priority on any issues, but direct contact is usually the best way to achieve clear and concise communication. This response is incorrect because the customer is not always right – in a disagreement, the contract takes precedence.

While Stephanie is not a developer, she learned much just by watching the developer, asking questions, and trying some simple coding. What type of learning has Stephanie completed in this scenario?
Teaching by watching
Correct answer
Active observation
Coaching by staff
Mentoring

Active observation, sometimes called shadowing, is what Stephanie has done in this scenario. Active observation is involved, asks questions, and may do some hands-on work to learn. Mentoring is when a more senior person advises someone on tasks, opportunities, and their role in the organization. Coaching by staff is not a valid project management term.

The project requires completion according to strict guidelines and government regulations. The project also involves completion ahead of industry standards, which Ashleigh and her peers are accustomed to in projects of this kind. Ashleigh is currently in the control procurements process, as documentation is rapidly updated. From the list below, which is the least likely document that will need updating during the control procurements process:
Cost baseline
Correct answer
Quality management plan
Procurement management plan
Schedule baseline
Overall explanation
Quality standards and requirements need to be met by all contractors, and especially under such circumstances. The organization's quality assurance programs usually set quality standards and the project must adhere to these standards, government compliance, and industry standards. As such, the quality management plan is least likely to be updated during the control procurement process. The procurement management plan likely will be updated during the project, so this choice is incorrect. It is not unusual for the cost baseline to be updated as there may be fluctuations in the project's cost, though project managers strive not to have cost changes during the project. The schedule baseline can also be updated with approved changes in the project.

Tell the team member to focus on the planned tasks.
Do nothing. The project scope has already been finalized.
Correct answer
Thank the team member and forward the request to the change control board for evaluation.
Overall explanation
Any change to a predictive project should be put into the change control process and approved or declined by the change control board. This will minimize the risk that the change will negatively impact the project. While the scope has been finalized, there is still a mechanism, the change control board, to allow changes. Telling the team member to focus on planned work will discourage them from exploring ways to improve the project. The stakeholders will be unable to approve the change, so waiting to bring up the idea until the next stakeholder's meeting is not ideal.

Anika's management has requested she create a chart depicting all of the project resource needs and associated activities. What type of chart is management expecting Anika to create?
A roles matrix
Correct answer
A roles and responsibilities matrix
A Gantt chart
A roles chart
Overall explanation
A roles and responsibility matrix is what management expects Anika to create. A roles and responsibilities matrix itemizes the roles and responsibilities and depicts the two intersecting. A Gantt chart is not an acceptable answer for this situation because a Gantt chart is a visual representation of the flow and duration of the project work against a calendar. Management is looking for more than just a listing of roles and collective responsibilities. There is not a roles matrix in project management, but there are roles and responsibilities matrixes, which is the correct answer.

Adam wants to let the other stakeholders know about an issue he is having on their project. The most appropriate way to do this in an agile project is to:
Document this issue in an email so it can be added to the risk log.
Correct answer
Discuss this in the next daily standup with the team.
Share this information in their next sprint review.
Share this information with the scrum master, who would then ask him to share this in the daily standup.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to discuss in the next daily standup, where roadblocks are communicated as part of the three questions for each resource. There is no need to go to the scrum master first. There is no need to wait until sprint review. There is no need to document in an email.

You are the project manager of the GHY Project and you are meeting with your project team to discuss the ground rules for the project. MaryAnne is a lead engineer and she says that everyone on the team is professional and that ground rules are not really needed. You disagree. What is the primary purpose of team ground rules?
The ground rules ensure that the project does not exceed the budget.
Supervisors know what to refer to when reprimanding their direct reports.
Correct answer
The ground rules make the team aware of what is expected of them.
The ground rules ensure that no one is late to meetings.
Overall explanation
Team ground rules make the expectations of team members very clear. With clear ground rules in place, team members know what is expected of them. Stipulating team ground rules does not ensure that they will be enforced. Team members may still violate these ground rules. While supervisors may bring up a violation of the team rules, this is not the primary purpose of the team ground rules. The ground rules ensure that no one is late to meetings is not realistic. You may have a rule that people arrive on time to meetings but people may still arrive late. The ground rules ensure that the project does not exceed the budget is admirable, but the rules will not prevent cost overruns.

Terrance works for a container company that is aiming to replace plastic egg cartons with biodegradable ones. As part of his stakeholder engagement plan, Terrance sent out a survey to 100 grocery shoppers on their opinions about the packaging composition change. However, 76 percent of shoppers stated they had no strong opinions about the egg carton containers. What action should Terrance take to further engage with these shoppers?
Keep satisfied
Correct answer
Monitor
Keep informed
Manage closely
Overall explanation
Terrance should monitor the shoppers. Stakeholders who should be monitored have low power and low interest in projects. Most of the surveyed shoppers stated they had no strong opinions about the materials for the cartons. Stakeholders who should be kept informed have low power but high interest to avoid significant issues from arising. Stakeholders who should be kept satisfied have high power but low interest to avoid these stakeholders from damaging the project. Stakeholders who should be managed closely have high power and high interest in the project.

Dennis’ team holds regular retrospectives to determine ideas for improvement in his agile project, and the team always offers a variety of suggestions. One of the agile values that they are exhibiting during this time is:
Decency
Education
Vocalization
Correct answer
Respect
Overall explanation
The value they are focused on is respect for the opinions of others in a retrospective. Retrospectives involve both Respect and Courage, but respect is the only accurate answer on the list. The other choices are not the best of those listed. The XP core values are simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect. Decency, education, and vocalization are not core values at all.

You are a project manager for your organization, and you are using a hybrid approach to your projects. Some of the predictive project management approach elements work well, and you are utilizing the iterative approach in agile. In your hybrid approach, management would like for you to identify each deliverable within the WBS with a number. The numbering system you should use with your WBS is called what?
Hybrid projects do not use a WBS.
WBS dictionary.
Chart of accounts.
Correct answer
Code of accounts.
Overall explanation
The code of accounts is used to provide a hierarchical structure for the deliverables identified in the WBS. The chart of accounts is an accounting tool for assigning predefined costs for deliverables such as cost per square foot, cost per hour, or cost per unit. Hybrid projects can utilize a WBS. The WBS dictionary defines each work package in the WBS and its associated time and cost estimate.

In your last project status meeting, you had ten team members. The meeting was not very productive as team members were holding sidebar conversations and not paying attention. As a result, you achieved nothing substantial from the meeting. What should you do next time to make the meeting more productive?
Establish meeting norms and ensure that all team members adhere to them.
Correct answer
Publish a meeting agenda.
Decrease the number of people in the meeting.
Ensure that you control the channels of communication.
Overall explanation
You should publish a meeting agenda and ensure that team members discuss the topics that are on the agenda. Decreasing the number of people is tempting, but there is no evidence that some people in the meeting need not be present. Large meetings require more control and planning to be effectively facilitated. You do not need to control communication channels, but you need to guide the meeting to the agenda items. Norms is a vague term to describe the expectations of the meeting (or other routines in the workplace). It is better to formally establish the rules of the meeting and always have a meeting agenda to guide the conversation.

Jerwin is the scrum master for Project V at the World Corporation. Project V operates in several countries worldwide and is intended to deploy a new website for World Corporation. Recently World Corporation announced it was closing an office supporting Project V and is either terminating or moving those workers. What is the next best step for Jerwin?
Correct answer
Evaluate the backlog for impacts to Project V.
Ask the steering committee to retain as many Project V workers as possible.
Remove items from the backlog to reduce Project V's scope.
Hire additional workers in unimpacted countries.
Overall explanation
Before acting, Jerwin should determine what impact this will have on the backlog. By reviewing the product backlog, Jerwin can understand what items have been completed, what is left in the queue, and what value has not been delivered to the organization through the project. Hiring additional workers may not be necessary. Asking the steering committee to retain workers may not be necessary. Jerwin would not remove items from the product backlog to reduce scope as this is the product owner's responsibility.

Overall explanation
The configuration management system is responsible for identifying and documenting the functional and physical characteristics of a product or component that a project is creating. The requirements gathering process does not fully answer the question. Stakeholder analysis does not complete this function. The planning process group is too broad to answer the question fully.

ROI
Correct answer
Risk probability
EMV
Risk action cost
Overall explanation
Risk probability is the only item used in the calculation risk exposure = risk probability x risk impact. EMV is the value (cost) of addressing risk. Risk action cost is a fictional term. ROI is the return on investment, which is not directly focused on risk.

You are using the predictive change control approach and the prioritized product backlog for hybrid projects in your organization. The project team has completed some of the project work incorrectly. You have instructed the project team to redo the work, and they have just completed it. What must happen next?
Correct answer
Review the defect repair.
Review each project team member’s performance.
Direct the product owner to add a task to review the rework.
Conduct an analysis of the delay because of the rework.
Overall explanation
The repair must be reviewed for accuracy. The repair must be correct before the project can move forward. If the repair is assumed to be correct, then the review of the time delay may be inaccurate because of future rework, waste, or a series of failures because of the inaccurate rework. The product owner does not add tasks; in addition, the project is using traditional change management for a hybrid approach. A review of each project team member’s performance is not the most pressing issue at this point in the project.

Acceptance Test-Driven Development is different than standard Test-Driven Development. As Debra writes her code, she can expect that she will most likely not have to:
Focus on the testing of business requirements.
Discuss the user story acceptance criteria when it is pulled from the backlog.
Implement upfront testing of requirements.
Correct answer
Focus exclusively on the testing of code.
Overall explanation
Debra will not focus exclusively on the test of code in ATDD, which is focused on requirements instead. In ATDD, developers do focus on testing business requirements. In ATDD, developers do write the test upfront. In ATDD, developers do discuss the acceptance criteria often when an item is pulled from the backlog.

Risks should be identified, documented in the risk register, and analyzed for their probability and impact on the project. Risk management is an ongoing activity in the project for the project manager and the project team. With that in mind, which one of the following represents a compliance risk?
A rare material required for manufacturing may not be available in the needed quantity.
A key technical contributor left the company for another job.
A strike near the Panama Canal threatens a project's on-time delivery.
Correct answer
A software developer not enabling the required two-factor authentication for financial data.
Overall explanation
Every example here is an example of a risk; however, only the lack of two-factor authentication is an example of compliance risk. This is a compliance risk because of the lack of extra security, two-factor authentication. This is a legal risk when handling customer data. A strike near the Panama Canal that threatens a project's on-time delivery is a general project risk, not compliance risk. A rare material required for manufacturing that may not be available in the needed quantity is a general project risk, not compliance risk. A key technical contributor that left the company for another job is a general project risk, not compliance risk.

Derrick is an exceptional team member on your project team. He always contributes to the utmost, has a great attitude, and helps his teammates in ways he can. While your project team is thriving in its development, the company has a hiring and promotion freeze due to an economic downturn. Raises have not been given in two years, and such movement is not likely until the economy and the profitability of the company change. You are worried about losing Derrick to another department or, worse, another employer. How can you reward Derrick while you wait for the company's fortunes to improve?
Correct answer
Find a way to recognize Derrick publicly.
Demote someone and give that job to Derrick.
Ask senior management for the funds to give Derrick a raise.
Nothing. Just wait.
Overall explanation
The best path is an employee recognition program. Not only does this benefit Derrick and you, but it creates a framework to recognize other employees. Asking for money for a raise would create an odd precedent if successful, as raises have been frozen in the organization. Demoting someone else for Derrick is not a reward and is not a good choice for this scenario. Doing nothing is almost always the worst choice. There is always something that you do to can show your team that you appreciate them.

Miora is the project manager for the Roselyn Project and has created a contract SOW (statement of work) for a vendor. Which of the following responses should not be included in the contract SOW?
A description of the collateral services required
The levels of the expected quality
Correct answer
Signatures of both parties in agreement with the SOW
Items being purchased
Overall explanation
It is not required that both parties sign and agree to the SOW. (This stipulation is included in the contract.) This response is incorrect because the levels of expected quality are typically part of the SOW. A description of collateral services required is typically included in the SOW and therefore is an incorrect response. Purchased items are typically part of the SOW, which makes this an incorrect response.

In your scrum team's daily standup meeting, several issues come up. Of the following choices, which issue is a blocker?
The lead developer's internet connection is slower than usual.
The deliverable scheduled to go to production is broken and must be fixed.
Correct answer
A code bug is found in a testing environment of a new feature.
A junior developer is out sick.
Overall explanation
The deliverable that was scheduled to go to production but needs fixing is an example of a blocker. It is important to understand the difference between a blocker and an impediment. An impediment slows down the progress of the team. A blocker completely stalls the team from delivering on time. Here, the deliverable needing to be fixed before going to production is a blocker. The lead developer's slow internet connection is an impediment because it is problematic, but it does not completely stall the project. The junior developer's absence is an impediment because it is problematic, but it does not completely stall the project. The bug found in a testing feature is an impediment because it is problematic, but it does not completely stall the project.

Ike is a scrum master at Watchdog Corporation, which runs multiple successful agile projects. Recently Ike met with another scrum master, David, in the organization. David seemed overwhelmed with the project and he is struggling to make decisions. The development team needs to choose an architecture quickly – but they are fearful of making the wrong decision as it will have a long-term effect on the project. What should Ike advise David to do next?
Assign an agile champion.
Replace the product owner with the project sponsor.
Speak to their team's managers to get insight into the problem.
Correct answer
Analyze the project information to make the best decision with the team.
Overall explanation
Ike should suggest the scrum master first determine what information they need to make their decision. This will help them gather useful information for their next steps. David may need to coach the team on the best decision – or help guide them to a decision to get the project moving again. Speaking to their manager is not the best option as the team and David already know what the problem is. It is the team's responsibility to decide and to start making progress on the project work. Replacing the product owner is not a good option and not something a scrum master can unilaterally do. An agile champion sits on the business side and helps evangelize agile.

You are a project manager for a midsized agile team, and you are a couple of weeks away from the end of the completion of your project. You know that some of your project team is returning for the next project you have lined up, but some are leaving the organization. While the work was accomplished, the team had many conflicts, and some were very rude and disrespectful to one another. You attempted to change this trend in the middle of the project, but the tone had already been set. As the next project starts, what is the best avenue to set the tone?
One-on-one discussions
Project charter
Project plan
Correct answer
Kickoff meeting
Overall explanation
The kickoff meeting would be a great time to establish team norms. Since you are at the beginning of the project and presumably have everyone in the same room, you can set the tone during the kickoff meeting. You want your project team and everyone to know that cordial communication is expected, and unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated. The project charter authorizes the project and the project manager and does not address the team rules. A better choice would be the team charter. The project plan defines how the project will be managed and the selected processes to be utilized. In an agile project, there is not a project plan. One-on-one discussions are not the best choice as people may feel singled out. It is best to give a conversation to the entire team at the start of the project.

Emotional intelligence and asynchronous communication
Correct answer
Convergence and shared collaboration

You were just assigned to take over a project from another project manager who is leaving the company. The previous project manager tells you that we have just finished the project's first phase during handover. What is the first thing you should do as a new project manager before starting the project's second phase?
Correct answer
Confirm that the first phase has reached its objectives and its deliverables are formally accepted.
Make sure that the resources of the next phase are available.
Check the project status against the plan.
Recommend corrective actions to close the gap between the planned and actual progress of the project.
Overall explanation
A formal acceptance is a sign-off that the project deliverables have been delivered as expected, and the customer accepts the project work as satisfactory. A phase or project must be formally closed and accepted before the next phase can start. The other choices presented are also required to be completed, but only after the closure of the first phase.
