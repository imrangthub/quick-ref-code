Question 2
Skipped
A project manager is assigned to an eco-friendly packaging project. In order to manage involved stakeholders, the project manager starts by analyzing their power, urgency, and legitimacy.

Which analysis method is the project manager applying?

Stakeholder cube

Correct answer
Salience model

Power/interest grid

Power/influence grid

Overall explanation
The salience model is a method used to classify stakeholders and decide who matters more by assessing their power, legitimacy, and urgency. The model allows the project manager to decide the relative salience of a given stakeholder (PMBOK 7th edition, page 171).

Question 3
Skipped
A project manager notices that his colleague, who is a fellow project manager, shows up at the office with new high-tech gadgets every day. This raises his suspicions that his colleague might be accepting gifts from hardware vendors who will be bidding on one of their company’s upcoming multimillion-dollar contracts.



What should the project manager do next?

Warn the concerned colleague that such gifts aren’t appropriate and leave it at that

Convince his colleague to return the items and stop accepting any gifts from vendors

Correct answer
Verify whether these items were gifts from vendors or he purchased them himself

Report his colleague to the organization so that a conflict-of-interest investigation can take place

Overall explanation
The best way to act in this situation is to verify facts before taking any action. A violation based only on suspicion should not be reported. The project manager can get the facts right by telling his colleague that he is concerned about how things might appear and simply inquire about the source of the items.



Options A, B, D: As a project manager, you should never jump to conclusions. You should always double-check facts before reporting a conflict-of-interest situation.

A project manager is working on a contract. Now that she completed the contract and closed the project, the project manager is out of work.



What type of organizational structure does the project manager work in?

Strong matrix

Correct answer
Projectized

Functional

Weak matrix

Overall explanation
A Project-oriented organization, or a projectized organization, is one in which a considerable part of its processes and activities take place in the form of projects. There is no defined hierarchy; resources are brought together specifically for the purpose of a project. When a project is complete, they either get transitioned to another project or released.

Question 5
Skipped
After deciding to invest more in the project management capabilities of the organization, a PMO is established to ensure compliance with a set of project management standards.



What type of PMO is the organization implementing?

Supportive

Explanation
Supportive PMOs only play a consultative role in projects.

Correct answer
Controlling

Explanation
A controlling PMO focuses on two key areas: Supporting the organization in applying project management practices and Requiring compliance with those practices. Such practices could include the adoption of a particular framework, the use of certain templates, conformance to governance, forms, etc.

Directive

Explanation
Directive PMOs take control of projects by directly managing them.

Agile

Explanation
Agile is a project development approach and not a type of Project Management Ofﬁce (PMO).

Question 6
Skipped
In an interior design project for a library, the client asks the project team to increase the number of bookshelves beyond what was agreed on. Since the project is on schedule and adding additional shelves will not cause any delay, the project manager consents to the client’s request.



This is an example of:

Gold Plating

Customer Obsession

Correct answer
Scope Creep

Successful Project

Overall explanation
Scope creep (also known as “feature creep” or “requirement creep”) refers to the uncontrolled expansion of the project’s scope (PMBOK 7th edition, page 249). The project manager should assess the change request from all perspectives, not only from schedule perspective, and follow the change control process in order to implement the change.



Option B: Customer obsession consists of an excessive focus on providing a better customer experience by meeting and even exceeding your client’s needs. However, customer obsession shouldn’t mean delivering beyond scope since the latter can increase the project schedule and cost, thus decreasing the success rate of the project.



Option A: The tackled situation is not considered gold plating since the client is the one who brought up the change request; it was neither the project manager nor team members who added changes without the client’s approval, as gold plating implies.

Question 7
Skipped
After a discussion with the development team, the scrum master decided to label backlog items as short-term, mid-term, and long-term. Soon after, the scrum master got an email from the product owner asking them to remove those labels, without giving any clear explanation.



What should the scrum master do next?

Ask for an explanation

Call for a meeting to address this issue

Wait until the next sprint planning meeting to update the labels as per the product owner’s request

Correct answer
Remove the labels

Overall explanation
The product owner is responsible for the product backlog. Consequently, the scrum master should remove the labels as per the product owner’s request, even if they didn’t get any clear explanation for this decision.

Domain
Process
Question 8
Skipped
The risk manager is collaborating with the project manager to perform a risk analysis.



To determine the most likely project completion date based on known risks, they conduct a simulation using the _________________tool to go through thousands of possible scenarios.

Correct answer
Monte Carlo analysis

Decision-tree analysis

Sensitivity analysis

Influence diagrams

Overall explanation
The project manager and the risk manager are using the Monte Carlo analysis to assess the possible impact of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on project goals. For example, if a particular risk arises, what impact will it have on the project schedule and cost? Monte Carlo provides a variety of potential outcomes and probabilities, allowing you to consider the likelihood of different scenarios (PMBOK 7th edition, page 177).

Question 9
Skipped
A project manager who follows the servant leadership style is onboarding a new team member who they believe can help fill skill-level gaps in the current project team.



The project manager provides the new team member with a copy of the project charter and commits to sending them a copy of ________________, which addresses team values, ground rules, and working agreements.

The employment contract

The resource management plan

The communication management plan

Correct answer
The team charter

Overall explanation
A team charter is a document that is developed in a group setting to clarify team direction while also establishing boundaries. It is created at the team’s forming phase in order to encourage understanding and buy-in. A team charter aligns the team with ground rules, team values, meeting guidelines, working agreements, as well as other group norms (PMBOK 7th edition, page 192).

People
Question 10
Skipped
A project manager is leading a project that has become so large (multiple teams, long duration, and huge budget) that the sponsor has been replaced by a steering committee.



What should the project manager do to accommodate this new change?

Correct answer
​Acknowledge that the stakeholders’ structure has changed and tailor communication accordingly

Work according to the original plan while keeping in mind that the project may now include additional stakeholders

​Hold a meeting with the new steering committee and continue working on the project

Share an updated status report with the new steering committee

Overall explanation
On large projects, one sponsor might not be enough. A Steering Committee is established when a large project involves multiple business units, organizations, or individuals who all have a substantial stake in the project’s success and outcomes. The project manager needs to be proactive and respond to this change. The initial communication plan for a single sponsor may not work for a steering committee. In order to ensure effective communication with the committee, the project manager must understand their communication requirements and preferences.

Question 11
Skipped
Three manufacturing lines are producing 5 mm diameter cylindrical steel bars. In order to perform a quality inspection, the project manager takes 10 random bars from each line.



The following are the inspection results in mm measurements. The results of Line 1 can be described as:


Accurate

Correct answer
Precise

Both accurate and precise

Neither accurate nor precise

Overall explanation
The results are precise because all measurements are close to 4.45mm (+ or - 5mm). Precision entails delivering end-products with similar dimensions, which may or may not be close to the required dimensions. Precise measurements are not necessarily close to the target value; they’re just close to one another.



Option A: Accuracy implies creating products with close dimensions to requirements.

Question 12
Skipped
A government contractor wants to keep the costs of building a public school under control while putting the risk on the vendor’s side. Moreover, the contractor wants to ensure that the seller is legally obliged to complete the contract, otherwise, the seller may face financial liabilities.



Which type of contract represents the least risk for the government contractor?

Correct answer
Fixed-price

Time & Materials (T&M)

Cost Plus Incentive Fee

​Cost-reimbursable

Overall explanation
Fixed price contracts present the least risk for the buyer. A fixed-price contract is one in which the payment does not depend on the spent time or used resources. It involves setting a fixed price for the service, product, or result defined in the contract (PMBOK 7th edition, page 191).

Process
Question 13
Skipped
In an effort to increase agile knowledge, a project manager has been paired with other Agile project managers to observe how they lead their teams. The project manager notices that many project decisions are the responsibility of the project team, while project managers are more facilitative than authoritative as they share a common vision and allow the team to focus on their work.

What leadership approach does this depict?

Participative leadership

Explanation
Participative leadership, aka democratic leadership, involves soliciting team members’ input while decision-making rests on the participative leader.

Autocratic leadership

Explanation
Autocratic leadership is when the leader makes all decisions on their own.

Transformational leadership

Explanation
Transformational leadership is when the leader motivates their team and enhances their productivity through high visibility and communication.

Correct answer
Servant leadership

Explanation
Agile project managers generally follow the servant leadership style, which consists in leading through serving the team. Servant leadership focuses on capturing and addressing the needs of team members in order to achieve good team performance (PMBOK 7th edition, page 17).

Question 16
Skipped
A project manager who works at a web agency, suggests creating a dropshipping e-commerce project since it’s profitable. Her manager, on the other hand, doesn’t fully agree.



What should the project manager do to persuade her manager?

​Calculate the project’s Cost Performance Index

Explanation
The Cost Performance Index is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources, calculated as the ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is used to assess the cost performance of a project that is already in progress. Since the project in question has not yet started, calculating the CPI is not applicable.

Conduct a SWOT Analysis

Explanation
SWOT Analysis can provide valuable insights into the potential advantages and challenges of the project. However, it does not offer a quantitative measure of profitability or financial viability, which is crucial for persuading the manager.

​Calculate the project’s Budget at Completion

Explanation
The Budget at Completion (BAC) is the total budget allocated for the project. While knowing the BAC is important for project planning and control, it does not provide information about the potential benefits or profitability of the project. Therefore, it is not sufficient to persuade the manager about the project's profitability.

Correct answer
​Calculate the project’s Cost-Benefit Ratio

Explanation
To persuade her manager to select the project, the project manager should use the Cost-Benefit Ratio to demonstrate the project's profitability.

Skipped
A project manager is running a project with remote and local resources. The remote team complains that they are not getting enough information about what’s going on with the project, which has caused them to do some rework. The project manager facilitates a conference call with the two teams, in which they decide to switch to a sophisticated enterprise chat platform to optimize communication.

Which conflict resolution technique did the project manager use?

Correct answer
Collaborate

Compromise

Force

Smooth

Overall explanation
The Collaboration/problem-solving conflict resolution technique is based on incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives. It necessitates a collaborative mindset and open communication to achieve consensus and commitment to an agreement. This approach aims to reach a win-win situation for all involved parties (PMBOK 7th edition, page 22).

A project manager is leading a software project using a hybrid approach. During a lessons-learned meeting, one of the team members complained that every time she submits a new piece of code, she finds many errors caused by the code changes made by her fellow developers. The project manager suggested testing, updating, and integrating new software code more frequently in order to reduce such errors.



Which of the following techniques did the project manager suggest?

Constant Integration

Consecutive Integration

Consistent Integration

Correct answer

A project manager is leading a project to implement a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for a local customer. The project manager guides the team to define the project requirements in detail before moving to execution. The project will be delivered after 4 months, but the customer will pay the organization in monthly installments.



Which of the following project development approaches is the project manager adopting?

Correct answer
Predictive

Adaptive

Iterative

Incremental

Overall explanation
Since requirements are fixed and deliverables will only be shipped at the end of the project, then the project manager is using a predictive approach.



Option C: The iterative approach is also characterized by a single delivery (Agile Practice Guide, page 18), but it has dynamic requirements.



Options B & D: Adaptive and incremental approaches involve frequent small deliveries. In the described scenario, payment installments are not linked to deliverables or iterations; it’s just a payment option that has no influence or connection to the project development approach.

Question 23
Skipped
A project manager is assigned to a 12-month project that has a $100,000 budget. Six months have passed and $60,000 has been spent. On closer inspection, the project manager finds out that so far, only 40% of the work has been completed.



The value of the completed 40% work is referred to as:

Planned value

Explanation
The planned value is $50,000 (50% of the budget).

Correct answer
Earned value

Explanation
Earned Value refers to the value of the work accomplished to date (PMBOK 7th edition, page 239). If the project gets terminated at this point, Earned Value will show you the value that the project has produced. In this case, the project’s Earned Value (EV) is $40,000 = 40% of the value of total work.

Actual cost

Explanation
The amount of $60,000 represents the Actual Cost (AC).

Cost variance

Explanation
The cost variance is -$20,000 (EV - AC).

Question 24
Skipped
A project manager is carrying out the initial planning activities for a gas pipeline construction project. When estimating the activity of installing 1000 meters of pipes, one team member states that they ran the same length of pipes in 14 hours on a previous similar project. Another team member claims that, according to the current project conditions, it’s possible to run 100 meters of gas pipes per hour.



Using the analogous estimating technique, how many hours will it take the team to run the gas pipeline?

10 hours

11 hours

12 hours

Correct answer
14 hours

Overall explanation
Unlike parametric estimating, the analogous estimating technique uses expert judgment by comparing a particular activity to a similarly completed one on a previous project in order to determine its duration or cost. This means that the project manager should rely on expert feedback, i.e., completing a similar task in 14 hours.

Question 25
Skipped
A project manager believes that being an active listener is not easy. She considers active listening to be more of an art than a skill, so she often encourages her team members to use a checklist of the key elements of active listening before any important meeting with stakeholders.



Which of the following are regarded as elements of active listening? (Select three)

Correct selection
Making eye contact

Correct selection
Paraphrasing

Correct selection
Interpreting information

Interrupting when appropriate

Overall explanation
Active listening is a skill that can be acquired and developed through practice. Instead of passively receiving the speaker’s message, active listening entails paying close attention to what is being said, asking questions to get a clear understanding of the situation, maintaining comfortable eye contact, remaining open-minded about others’ opinions, employing paraphrasing skills and feedback, and keeping an eye on non-verbal signs such as the body language and facial expressions of the speaker.



Option D: Active listening involves allowing others to completely express their ideas without interrupting them.

Question 26
Skipped
A project manager is leading a construction project of a shopping center. During the execution phase, the project manager received an approved change request from the client to modify the partition of the center. After checking the change request, the project manager realized that the budget allocated for its implementation might not be sufficient.



What should the project manager do next?

Correct answer
Discuss the budget of the change with the client

Explanation
The project manager must discuss the impact of the change request on the project cost with the client.

Implement the change since it’s already approved

Explanation
The project manager should not process the change request unless the client understands and accepts its impact. Usually, the project manager is part of the Change Control Board (CCB), which ensures the project manager’s review and awareness of the change request. However, in the described scenario, the project manager doesn’t seem to be part of the CCB since they were not aware of the change request until it was approved.

Therefore, the project manager should analyze and validate the consequences of the change before implementing it.

Reject the change request due to its inadequate budget

Explanation
The CCB, represented by the client in the described scenario, could amend the change request in the light of the Project Manager’s input.

Disregard the change request since the project follows a predictive approach

Explanation
Change in all projects is inevitable, including predictive projects. The project manager doesn’t have the authority to reject a change request; it’s up to the CCB to approve or reject change requests.

Question 27
Skipped
An activity has an Early Start (ES) of day 5, a Late Start (LS) of day 12, an Early Finish (EF) of day 10, and a Late Finish (LF) of day 17.



Which of the following statements are correct regarding this activity? (Select two)

The activity is on the critical path

Correct selection
The activity is not on the critical path

Correct selection
The activity has a float

The activity has a lag

Overall explanation
Since it has a 7-day float, this activity is not on the critical path. The float of this activity can be calculated by subtracting the Early Start (day 5) from the Late Start (day 12) or by subtracting the Early Finish (day 10) from the Late Finish (day 17). Since the float of the activity is greater than zero, then it’s not on the critical path. Remember that critical path activities have zero float.



Option D: Lag time is the amount of time whereby a successor activity is required to be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. However, since the described scenario doesn’t have any information about the successor activity, it does not consist of a lag.

Question 31
Skipped
During the iteration review, the project team was demonstrating new features to the Product Owner. The product owner was resting his hands on the table with a relaxed and open posture, while occasionally fiddling with his pen or coffee mug without looking directly at the speaker.



What kind of communication is the product owner using? (Select two)

Paralingual communication

Active listening

Correct selection
Implicit message

Correct selection
Non-verbal communication

Overall explanation
Non-verbal communication is used to convey implicit messages. It includes gestures, facial expressions, and paralinguistics such as voice tone or volume, body language, personal space, eye contact, touch, and appearance. These non-verbal signals can provide additional information and meaning to verbal communication.



Option A: Paralingual communication (such as the use of voice tone, volume, pitch, intonation, etc.) is non-verbal, but it’s not the right answer because the product owner didn’t communicate any vocal messages.



Option B: The scenario doesn’t describe active listening either, since the product owner is not interacting or paying attention to the demonstration.

Question 32
Skipped
While traditional project management follows predefined phases and sticks to the predetermined scope, Agile project management approaches:

Correct answer
Encapsulate analysis, design, implementation, and test within an iteration

Involve documenting, estimating, and sequencing each planned activity in detail

Use Gantt charts along with well-defined activities, responsibilities, and time frames

Map the iteration backlog into a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Overall explanation
The iterative method is the heart of the Agile development process. Each iteration generates a piece of the product until the final product is fully completed and delivered.

A typical iteration process flow involves:

Analysis: to define the iteration requirements based on the product backlog, sprint backlog, and feedback from customers and stakeholders.

Development: includes design and implementation based on the defined requirements.

Testing: involves Quality Assurance testing.

Delivery: integrating the working iteration into production,

Feedback: receiving customer and stakeholder feedback to define the requirements of the next iteration.

An experienced project manager believes that managers should embrace transparency in their projects, as its many benefits often outweigh its disadvantages. However, the project manager thinks that, while it is favorable to share many aspects with the project team, there are a few things that shouldn’t be shared with everyone.



As a project manager, you must be transparent about:

Confidential information

Proprietary information

Unproven information and gossip

Correct answer
Decision-making processes

Overall explanation
The project manager must demonstrate transparency regarding their decision-making processes. Communication and reasoning about decisions concerning the project should be well-documented and accessible to everyone on the team. Transparency in project communication allows team members to see all aspects and decisions of a project that may affect or be of interest to them (PMBOK 7th edition, page 20).

Question 38
Skipped
A project manager is in the phase of planning the redesign of a commercial building. The project team includes one carpenter who is only available to work part-time. Since the carpenter’s work is on the critical path, the project manager has to push back the project’s planned completion date to accommodate the carpenter’s availability.



What technique did the project manager use?

Load Balancing

Explanation
Load balancing is common in computing and it refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a number of resources with the aim of speeding up the overall data processing.

Resource Loading

Explanation
Resource loading is the total assigned hours of work divided by the number of hours you have to do the work.

Correct answer
Resource Leveling

Explanation
Resource leveling is used to optimize resource allocation by adjusting the activities’ start and finish dates. This often results in changing the original critical path, as was the case in the described scenario; the carpenter is a scarce resource for the project and her availability is constrained, which led to extending the project schedule to manage this limitation.

Being unable to achieve the sprint goal is not a reason to cancel it and start it over. The project manager cannot cancel the sprint either, since it’s up to the product owner to take such a decision.

Discuss with the team the root cause of their poor performance, during the standup meeting

Explanation
Stand-up meetings are not a suitable framework for addressing and identifying the root cause of any occurring problem. Instead, this could be done in a longer dedicated meeting, after the standup for instance.

Discuss with the product owner the possibility of updating the sprint goal to make it more achievable

Explanation
The sprint goal is a brief explanation of what the team plans to achieve during the sprint, therefore updating it has no impact on the sprint workload and on whether the team will be able to complete it or not.

Correct answer
Invite the product owner and the team to renegotiate the sprint backlog, and help the team overcome the encountered problems

Explanation
Since the cross-functional team were unable to complete any of the user stories, the best course of action is to meet with the product owner and try to maximize the value of the sprint and achieve most of the sprint goal by renegotiating the sprint backlog; reducing and prioritizing the scope of work. Besides, the project manager should support the team to overcome the encountered problems.

Question 40
Skipped
A project manager is facilitating a meeting to define the user stories of the next iteration. Two team members, Charlotte and Sam, get too vocal during the meeting. Charlotte believes that user story #2 is clear enough, while Sam thinks it's ambiguous and needs further elaboration. The team moves on to the next user story, ignoring Sam’s point of view. Sam accepts the team’s decision and remains quiet for the rest of the meeting. At the end of the meeting, the project manager tells Sam that user story #2 could be reviewed during the iteration’s first week when more information is available.



Which of the following conflict-resolution techniques did Sam use in this scenario?

Smoothing

Compromising

Forcing

Correct answer
Withdrawal

Overall explanation
In the described scenario, Sam had to concede his position to maintain harmony during the meeting. This conflict resolution technique is referred to as withdrawal or avoidance, which results in a lose-leave situation (PMBOK 7th edition, page 169).



Option A: The project manager used the smoothing or accommodating technique, which leads to a yield-lose situation by de-emphasizing differences.

During the project execution phase, the Change Control Board (CCB) approved a change request that no one on the project team knew how to implement.



What should the project manager do to deal with this issue? (Select two)

Document the issue in the issue log

Correct selection
Hire a subject matter expert

Formally request the CCB to revoke their decision

Correct selection
Ask the team to do more research on how to implement the approved change request

Overall explanation
Hiring a subject matter expert and conducting more research will help your team implement the change request. This is considered a problem-solving approach since it entails ﬁnding solutions to the encountered issues or challenges. Uncertainty can be reduced by collecting more information through conducting research, engaging experts, or performing a market analysis (PMBOK 7th edition, page 229).

A project manager is evaluating a potential industrial project. To determine whether its anticipated financial gains will outweigh its present-day investment, the project manager uses the Net Present Value (NPV) as an effective tool to help her determine whether the project will be profitable or not.



For instance, NPV > 0 means:

The project will lose money

The project will break even

Correct answer
The project is profitable

We can’t know until the ROI is calculated

Overall explanation
The larger the Net Present Value (NPV), the more profitable the project will be for the organization. A positive NPV indicates that the investment is worthwhile.

A project manager is leading a small team of developers using project management software that includes a Kanban board. After receiving many questions from team members on how to create, review, and validate tasks or issues, the project manager decides to create the following chart.



This chart is called:




Pareto chart

Correct answer
Flowchart

Context diagram

Scatter diagram

Overall explanation
A flowchart (also referred to as a process map, progress flow, and progress flow diagram) graphically displays the logical order of a process (PMBOK 7th edition, page 189).



Options A & D: A Pareto chart is displayed as a histogram, representing the most serious causes of an error, while a scatter diagram is used to determine the correlation between two variables. Both diagrams don't show a task or issue’s management process flow.



Option C: Context diagrams are used to visually demonstrate how a business process, other systems, and people, all interact. Context diagrams can include a business process as one of its components, but they can’t provide insight into a particular process flow.

Planning skills to identify resource requirements

Correct answer
Interpersonal skills to convince her manager of her need for additional resources

Interviewing skills to hire the required resources

Technical skills to respond to the risk associated with adding more resources

Overall explanation
Trying to convince upper management requires the use of interpersonal skills, which are often needed when acquiring resources.



Option A: The project manager may lack planning skills since she didn’t identify the resource requirement from the beginning, but this situation does not tackle this aspect or the need to respond to the risk associated with adding more resources.

Question 45
Skipped
After baselining the scope and during project execution, a key stakeholder, who is a member of the Change Control Board (CCB), requested a new requirement. The project manager is convinced that this new requirement can add value to the project.



What should the project manager do?

Implement the change request since the key stakeholder is a member of the CCB

Implement the change request since it will add value to the project

Correct answer
Submit a change request according to the change control system

Record the change request in the change log

Overall explanation
Regardless of the fact that the change was requested by a member of the CCB, the project manager should submit a change request according to the procedures defined in the change control system. This system describes how modifications to project deliverables should be undertaken (PMBOK 7th edition, page 332).



Options A & B: The project manager should not implement the change without getting the CCB’s formal approval. Being convinced of the change’s value or having the consent of one member of the CCB is not sufficient to move forward with the implementation.



Option D: The change request is not submitted yet to the CCB, so it should not be recorded in the change log. After submitting it, the change log should be updated to track the status of the change.

​Bottom-up

Overall explanation
The bottom-up method can be used as an estimation technique for the project's overall cost by estimating the approximate value of smaller components and using the total sum of these values to find the overall cost. This type of estimation is used to create the project schedule or budget. The project work is typically subdivided into smaller parts and each component is given a duration and cost estimate. The individual duration estimates are aggregated to determine the schedule, while the individual cost estimates are aggregated to determine the budget.

A project manager is assigned to an industrial project that follows a predictive approach.



During the risk planning phase, the project manager decided to create a contingency reserve for:

Passive risk acceptance

Correct answer
​Active risk acceptance

Workaround

​Unidentified risks

Overall explanation
Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken (PMBOK 7th edition, page 248). The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs.



Option A: Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from a periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly (PMBOK 6th edition, page 443).

What should the project manager do?

Put an end to the discussion to avoid getting the meeting out of control

Explanation
The project manager only facilitates this type of meeting in order to keep it on track and reach a consensus, thus she should not stop the discussion in order to take control.

Correct answer
Help team members decide the best way to implement the concerned requirement

Explanation
Taking into consideration the project manager’s lack of technical knowledge, she should not interfere in the decision-making process when it comes to the best way to implement the concerned project requirement.

Inform team members that the final decision should be taken by her after listening to their opinions

Explanation
The project manager should let subject matter experts, i.e team members decide since they have the needed knowledge and experience to make the right decision.

The key stakeholder was impressed with the project’s progress and requested from the project manager to urgently add a new user story to improve the product’s User Interface (UI).



How should the project manager respond to this request?

Welcome the stakeholder’s request and add the user story to the sprint backlog

Add the user story to the product backlog and schedule it for the next sprint to protect the team from disruptions

Correct answer
Add the user story to the product backlog and let the product owner decide its priority

Refuse to create the user story since it’s the product owner’s responsibility to maintain and refine the product backlog

Overall explanation
The project manager should add the user story to the product backlog and let the product owner decide its priority.



Option A & B: When a new requirement is received, it should be added to the product backlog (not the sprint backlog) and then prioritized by the product owner in order to be implemented.

What should the project manager do?

Correct answer
Talk to the senior team member privately to try and find out the reason behind their behavior while making it clear that discrimination is neither tolerated nor accepted.

Explanation
The project manager should talk to the senior team member privately to get to know the reason behind their behavior. Besides, the project manager should be clear about not tolerating any kind of discriminating behavior towards the new team member and the potential consequences and disciplinary procedures the senior team member will face in case their behavior persists.

Explanation
The project manager should talk directly to the concerned party with no need for escalating the issue to the functional manager at this stage.

Look past the senior team member’s behavior since no conflict between the two has occurred and work seems to be going just fine.

Explanation
Such behavior should not be ignored, even when it seems to have no tangible impact on work progress.

​Give the developer a formal warning via email so they can work on improving their work quality

Correct answer
​Meet with the developer in person and offer support if needed

Escalate the issue to the developer's line manager and ask them to immediately address the issue

Overall explanation
The project manager needs to understand the reason for recurrently missed deadlines in order to provide appropriate support. As the project manager, they should meet the team member to inquire about what’s going on with them and listen attentively. To address such issues, you should start out by simply naming the problem and asking for the team member’s perspective. You might learn that deadlines weren’t as clear as you thought, or that there is something blocking their work progress. Talk about the impact of missed deadlines; The idea here is to demonstrate that these aren’t simply arbitrary deadlines as they have real-world consequences. You should clearly state your expectations for what needs to change in the future. Finally, discuss the next specific steps they’ll take to solve the problem – ideally, something they'll come up with on their own, but if they’re struggling, you can be fairly direct about what you’d like them to try.

Correct answer
Personally meet with the stressed team member to discuss ways to better manage their time

Raise the issue with the team in the daily stand-up meeting

Track the stressed team member’s tasks in a separate backlog for additional analysis and reporting

Overall explanation
One of the key qualities of effective managers is their ability to actively listen to those around them. In this situation, the project manager has to step into their leadership role and offer guidance to the team member who seems to be overwhelmed. If this team member is unable to manage their workload, the project manager should encourage them to prioritize their work to be more efficient. Ultimately, if the member can’t keep up with a realistic workload, a personal improvement plan should be put in place, including training if needed. This process should be fully documented.



Option C: The daily standup is dedicated to syncing work between team members and removing any impediments. So, it’s not a suitable frame for addressing individual performance issues.

Question 76
Skipped
Before starting the project, and after identifying all of the individuals and groups involved or affected by the project, the project manager took a step further by classifying stakeholders according to their level of power, interest, and influence.



This step is referred to as:

Correct answer
Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder identification

Stakeholder monitoring

Stakeholder engagement

Overall explanation
Since the question states that stakeholders were already identified and that the project didn't start yet, stakeholder analysis is the right answer. Stakeholder analysis refers to the classification of all project stakeholders in order to ensure efficient engagement later on.



Option D: Stakeholder engagement takes place in the execution process group and it involves: communicating and collaborating with stakeholders to meet their expectations, addressing issues, and fostering appropriate stakeholder involvement.



Option C: Stakeholder monitoring implies assessing stakeholders’ satisfaction and whether their engagement plan is effective or it needs to be updated (PMBOK 7th edition, pages 11-12-14).

A project manager is leading a predictive project.



After identifying a risk, the project manager decides to transfer it to another party by:

Correct answer
Buying insurance

Accepting a lower profit in case of cost overrun

Asking the sponsor to deal with the risk

Eliminating the risk through beta testing

Overall explanation
Risk transfer involves transmitting future risks from one party to another. A common example of risk transfer is purchasing insurance where the risk of a person or an organization is transferred to the insurance company.



Option C: Asking the sponsor to deal with the risk is an escalation rather than a risk transfer.



Options B & D: Other risk response strategies include avoiding, mitigating, or accepting the risk (PMBOK 7th edition, page 123).

Due to a financial crisis, an organization decided to pause all internal projects to an undefined date. A project manager within this organization has a weekly meeting with a subcontractor who provides the majority of the project’s physical resources.



What type of communication should the project manager use to inform the subcontractor of the contract discontinuation decision?

Informal written

Correct answer
Formal written

Informal verbal

Formal verbal

Overall explanation
When dealing with complex issues, such as updating a plan or dealing with legal matters, it would be best to document such discussions and decisions using a formal written format. According to the PMBOK 6th edition (Page 499): “The buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, provides the seller with formal written notice that the contract has been completed. Requirements for formal procurement closure are usually deﬁned in the terms and conditions of the contract”.

Question 79
Skipped
During a workshop about the Agile approach, the project manager stated that Agile teams should be cross-functional and self-organizing, explaining that:

Each member of the team should be cross-functional and self-organized

Correct answer
The Agile team should have all the required skills to deliver the product on their own

The Agile team should have complementary skill sets and be able to organize the backlog by themselves

The Agile team should self-organize to acquire the necessary skills to be cross-functional

Overall explanation
A cross-functional team is a group of individuals who acquire different substantial skill sets that are enough to accomplish their common goal proficiently. A self-organizing team is autonomous in the sense that it does not rely on any outsiders to figure out how to best accomplish its work. This does not mean that each team member possesses all of the necessary skills for delivering the product; rather, they just need to be competent in their area of expertise.

Despite creating an agenda and timeboxing the meetings, the project manager struggles to engage all attendees.



What should the project manager do?

Make meetings shorter to prevent boredom

Limit the interventions of the most talkative attendees to allow others to participate

Change to remote meetings to make everyone feel more comfortable

Correct answer
Encourage all attendees to participate and share their thoughts by asking for their opinions on the discussed matters

Overall explanation
As a facilitator, the project manager must ensure that all attendees take part in the meeting by encouraging them to share their ideas and opinions and engaging them in the discussed topics. It’s among their responsibilities as a facilitator to ensure that everyone takes part in the decision-making, problem-solving, brainstorming, etc. activities that take place during meetings.

Promoting participation and maintaining the ideas and discussions flow during such events is an indication of efficient facilitation.



Option A & C: Changing meetings from face-to-face to virtual or limiting their duration does not guarantee more engagement or participation.



Option B: Limiting the intervention of talkative participants will only result in more inactive attendees.

Two agile teams are working on developing the same product. Team A is made of 5 members and uses 2-week sprints, while Team B involves 4 members and uses 3-week sprints. Team A completed all sprint backlog items with a velocity of 50 story points. Team B, on the other hand, reached 70 story points, without completing all of the sprint’s backlog.



Which team has better performance?

Correct answer
Team A, since they completed all sprint backlog items

Team A, taking into consideration their velocity, they can achieve 75 story points in a 3-week sprint, which is better than what team B achieved

Team B, since they have a better velocity

Team B, since they achieved more story points with fewer team members

Overall explanation
The team that has better performance is the team that fulfills its sprint engagement by completing all of its backlog items. This means that the performance of team A was better than the performance of team B.



Options B & C: Velocity should not be used to compare teams’ performance.



Option D: Likewise, the number of completed user stories per sprint and team size can not indicate whether a team’s performance is good or not.

Question 82
Skipped
A product owner and team members have different interpretations of a particular user story. To resolve the disagreement, the project manager suggests the creation of personas.



What’s the most probable reason for creating personas?

To use it as a wireframe to help clarify project outcomes

To engage stakeholders who don’t know much about the project

Correct answer
To help the development team empathize with the users of the solution

To identify and describe real users of the solution

Overall explanation
A persona is a fictional representation of the ideal potential users of a product or service. This description helps the team understand and empathize with the users’ need for the solution. Thus, the team can better adapt the solution to help and satisfy its users in real-life situations.



Options A & B: Persona does not have a role in stakeholder engagement, nor is it a wireframe for clarifying project outcomes.



Option D: Even though a persona involves a set of real-life characteristics, it does not identify or describe the real users of the solution.

What is this meeting missing? (Select two)

Minutes

Correct selection
An agenda

An objective

Correct selection
A facilitator

Overall explanation
The meeting probably does not have either a clear agenda or a facilitator. An agenda organizes and structures a meeting’s discussions, while a facilitator ensures that the agenda is being followed and respected.



Option A: Minutes of Meeting, aka MoM, is a summary of what happened during a meeting. MoM serve as a written record for future reference, thus they cannot be what caused this meeting to be chaotic.



Option C: The meeting already has an objective; concluding a procurement in the negotiation phase. But, since no one is assigned to facilitate the meeting, it’s probable that the objective was not appropriately communicated to all attendees in the first place, resulting in the described chaos.

During the sprint review, the product owner informs the scrum team that the meeting is being recorded in order to send it to a key stakeholder. A day later, the stakeholder contacted the product owner to express their disappointment with the product, claiming that it is nothing like what they had in mind.



What should the project manager do next?

Correct answer
Facilitate a meeting between the product owner and the concerned stakeholder

Explanation
Since the product doesn’t meet the expectation of the key stakeholder, then there is no alignment between the product owner and the stakeholder. The product owner is responsible for gathering and prioritizing requirements. The feedback of the stakeholder indicates that the product owner didn’t involve them enough in the process. As an agile project manager or scrum master, you can help the product owner, who is the stakeholder representative, while also protecting your team from dealing with such issues.

Meet the stakeholder to review the product backlog items

Explanation
In Scrum, it’s the product owner’s responsibility to review the product backlog items.

Ask the development team to have more frequent backlog refinement sessions with the product owner

Explanation
The project manager should address the issue on hand. The frequency of the backlog refinement is not related to the dissatisfaction of the key stakeholder.

Ask the development team to collaborate with the key stakeholder

Explanation
The development team should collaborate with the product owner, who in turn should review the product backlog items with the key stakeholder, being their point of contact in the project.

A project manager is leading an adaptive project using an online project management system that displays the real-time progress of the iterations and the overall project through different charts. However, a key stakeholder prefers to receive an email with the weekly status report instead.



What should the project manager do? (Select two)

Add a small recurring task of “1” story point in the product backlog to send the weekly report

Correct selection
Take this in charge in order to let the team focus on achieving deliverables

Correct selection
Check if there is a way to automatically send the weekly report through the project management system

Ignore the stakeholder request since they have access to the online system and therefore can easily check the project status

Overall explanation
The project manager should remove impediments that slow down the team's progress towards achieving the iteration goal. This can be done by taking this task in charge, whether by sending the status reports manually or by finding a way to automate it. Furthermore, the project manager can remind the key stakeholder that they have real-time access to the project status.

Upon the client’s request, a project manager of an e-commerce website development project agreed to extend the scope while committing to the same delivery date. In order to achieve that, the project team must work 24/7.



What should the project manager do?

Start a night shift for the collocated team members

Explanation
The current team is not able to finish the work in the determined delivery date. Making them work at night will not change anything as it won’t have an impact on the pace of work.

Correct answer
Hire virtual teams that work in different time zones and schedules

Explanation
The project manager can crash the project by hiring a virtual team that works in different time zones and on different days of the week. Hiring resources from different geographical zones allows the project to operate 24/7 without overworking the team. Since the project involves creating an e-commerce website, having virtual teams on the project is functional and practical. Constructing or manufacturing projects, on the other hand, can’t take advantage of hiring a virtual team. However, they can opt for night shifts as a workable alternative.

Fast-track the project

Explanation
Fast Tracking is a schedule compression technique that consists of concurrently completing tasks that would normally be completed sequentially. According to the scenario, the project manager needs to crash the project since the workload increased significantly to the point that the project team have to work 24/7 to complete it.

​Use the resource leveling technique

An agile project manager noticed that several stakeholders have lost interest in the project; they rarely provide inputs, give feedback, or attend meetings.



What should the project manager do? (Select two)

Send a reminder before each meeting

Inform stakeholders that they can provide their feedback anonymously

Correct selection
Value and show appreciation of everyone's ideas

Correct selection
Demonstrate the working increments

Overall explanation
Most probably, stakeholders are losing interest in the project because their input or feedback is being disregarded, or they are not seeing any tangible progress. The project manager has to engage stakeholders by taking their feedback into consideration to show them that their ideas are valued. The project manager should also demonstrate working increments as early in the project lifecycle as possible. This is considered one of the advantages of the agile approach that stakeholders expect and appreciate.

A project manager is managing a project using a hybrid approach. After one week of the first iteration, the customer informs the project manager that they were dissatisfied with the deliverables.



What should the project manager do next?

Ask the customer to submit a change request so that their dissatisfaction can be addressed

Explanation
Since the project is hybrid, the project manager may also need to ask the customer to submit a change request if out-of-scope work is requested.

Use soft skills to convince the customer that the deliverables conform to project specifications

Explanation
If the project manager realizes that it’s just a misunderstanding or the customer is missing some details regarding the project deliverables, then the project manager can simply use their soft skills to explain and convince them that the deliverables are good.

Correct answer
Investigate the cause of dissatisfaction and verify the deliverables

Explanation
The first thing the project manager should do is listen to the customer, take note of the reasons behind their dissatisfaction, and verify the deliverables. Once this is done, the project manager will be equipped with all of the needed information to make the best decision.

A project manager is in charge of a new bridge construction project. The project manager was informed by one of the subject matter experts that, next July, all of the bridge construction work will need to stop taking into consideration the past history of river flooding due to hurricane season. The project manager agrees with the expert and arranges to stop the work during that month.



This decision is considered as:

​Acceptance​

Transfer

​Mitigation

Correct answer
​Avoidance

Overall explanation
The project manager’s decision to stop construction work during July means that they’re trying to avoid the risk rather than accept it. The project manager made the safe decision to stop all construction work during hurricane season to avoid the risk of financial loss or putting the project staff in danger. This risk response is suitable for threats of high priority, high probability of occurrence, and a considerable negative impact.



Option C: The decision can not be to mitigate because mitigation implies that the project manager would attempt to reduce the threat’s probability of occurrence and/or impact, which can’t be done since they have no control over river floods, nor did they take any prior action to mitigate its damage if it does occur (PMBOK 7th edition, page 123).

The project’s cost variance is $0.00 too

The project’s EAC equals its BAC

Overall explanation
Schedule variance (SV) measures whether your project is on track by calculating its actual progress against expected progress to determine how ahead of or behind schedule the project work is. SV equals the difference between your project’s earned value and planned value: SV = EV – PV. Therefore, an SV of $0.00 means that the project’s EV equals its PV.

Use their leadership skills to motivate their team to reach the estimated velocity

Extend the duration of the sprint until completing 50 story points

Correct selection
Study with the product owner the possibility of adding more resources to the team

Overall explanation
Scrum uses empirical data to measure work progress, therefore the project manager should let the product owner know that, based on current performance, the release plan is not feasible. The product owner can update the release plan or study with the project owner the possibility of adding more resources to the team.



Options B, C: The capacity of the team is around 36 story points, and it wouldn’t be possible to motivate the team to consistently reach 50 points on each sprint. Besides, a sprint has a timeboxed duration which should not be extended for any reason.

Which of the following statements best describes this scenario?

Correct answer
The project team made a wrong assumption

Explanation
The project team made the assumption that all of the company’s computers are compatible with the new operating system. Consequently, they planned the project based on this belief. But later on, they found out that their assumption is untrue.

The project team didn't develop an appropriate project plan

Explanation
Assumptions should be logged during the project planning phase to take into consideration when creating the project plan, and that’s what the team most probably did since they developed a detailed plan. Therefore, the issue is not a result of poor planning.

The project team didn’t establish an adequate risk response

Explanation
Since it wasn’t discovered during the project planning, the encountered issue wasn’t identified as a risk.

The project team didn’t consider the new version of the operating system as a constraint

Train project managers on the adaptive approaches to help convince the team

Stick to the predictive approach to avoid any conflicts

Correct answer
Use a hybrid method that combines both adaptive and the predictive practices

Overall explanation
Transitioning a team to Agile could be difficult and confusing when they are not accustomed to or familiar with this approach. One of the most effective transition methods is the adoption of a hybrid approach that combines both predictive and adaptive methods as a means of introducing Agile to the team.

A project manager is assigned to lead a big project, with a key portion requiring outsourcing to a service provider. To reduce risk, the project manager wants to ensure that the selected provider is well suited to the project and quality requirements before granting the whole contract.



What should the project manager do?

Hire an auditor to continuously check the quality of the provider’s work

Make the contract flexible in order to be able to replace the provider easily if quality is not met

Carefully choose the selection criteria

Correct answer
Ask the service provider to do a trial engagement

Overall explanation
Some projects engage several candidate sellers for initial paid work before making the full commitment to one seller. This allows the buyer to evaluate potential partners, while simultaneously making progress on project work.



Options A, B, C: These options could help select the best provider, and manage their work and contractual relationship. However the scenario is directly related to the concept of doing a trial.

Question 112
Skipped
A project manager opts for planning poker to estimate user stories. After going through the details of the first user story, the project manager asks team members to choose a card to represent their estimation of the ideal number of days required to complete the user story, and then to reveal their cards. The estimates were vastly disparate, so the project manager instantly asked team members to re-estimate the user story in an attempt to converge their estimations.



What did the project manager do wrong?

The team used ideal days to estimate the user story

Correct answer
The team re-estimated the user story immediately after revealing their cards

Cards shouldn’t be revealed

The project manager shouldn’t waste time with multiple rounds of estimates

Overall explanation
Team members missed out on the benefit of discussing the reasoning behind their estimations when they immediately moved on to re-estimation. Often, estimates vary in the first round of planning poker. The team should discuss the story and each one's estimates. After the discussion, each team member should re-estimate the story again by selecting a card. The process should be repeated until reaching a consensus. The number of estimation rounds may vary from one user story to another.

A project manager discovers a serious threat to the project; one of the project contractors might declare bankruptcy. If that happens, the project will be delayed for another two months.



What should the project manager do to mitigate the risk?

Review the contract to check the consequences of any contract breach

Explanation
Reviewing the contract is considering a passive acceptance since no proactive action is taken to deal with the risk.

Immediately stop working with the contractor

Explanation
Stop working with the contractor is not appropriate because the bankruptcy is not confirmed and there is no information about any replacement.

Contact an insurance company to secure coverage for potential losses

Explanation
Contacting an insurance company is considered a transfer risk strategy rather than a mitigation strategy.

Correct answer
Contact other contractors who can supply the necessary materials

Explanation
The project manager contacted different vendors in order to have other alternatives ready in case the risk occurs. By doing this, the possibility of the project’s delay is reduced, i.e., Risk Mitigation.

A company provides an open workspace as a way of fostering team collaboration. However, while managing an agile software project, a senior developer approached the project manager to request a separate office where she can better focus on her work since she was unable to carry out some critical tasks in the common team area.



What should the project manager do?

Convince the senior developer of the advantages of working in the same space as her colleagues

Move the senior developer to a separate cubicle

Correct answer
Allow the senior developer to work in a separate area until her complex tasks are solved

Ask the whole team not to make noise as it might disturb others

Overall explanation
Companies that go for a “Caves and Common” office design (“Caves” refers to private spaces such as separate offices or cubicles and “Common” refers to common work areas) allow their agile team members to temporarily work in quiet separate areas if they are unable to concentrate in the common open area. However, once they have finished the work at hand, they should return to the common team space (Agile Practice Guide, page 46).

An organization has recently converted to Agile. After a few months, the project manager’s supervisors complained that Team A was performing poorly because it always had a lower velocity than Team B.



What should the project manager do?

Move some of Team B’s best performers to Team A

Set up a reward program to motivate Team A

Encourage Team A to increase their velocity in the upcoming sprints

Correct answer
Inform the supervisors that they can’t compare the performance of different teams based on their velocity

Overall explanation
An agile team decides how many story points to tackle based on their own estimations, which can be different across teams. Thus, velocity can’t be used to compare the performance of different teams.

During the sprint retrospective meeting, the project team suggested improving communication and collaboration by using fishbowl windows and remote pairing. Despite the project manager’s concern that this might negatively impact the team’s productivity, the project manager agrees to implement both tools in order to promote self-organization within the team.



What should the project manager do next?

Correct answer
At the end of the following sprint, the project manager and the project team should evaluate the impact of the new practices.

Explanation
Following the new practices’ implementation, the project manager and the team need to verify any performance improvements or deteriorations during the next sprint retrospective so the team can further adjust and reflect on the process. Evaluating the impact could be done by checking the burndown or burnup charts, measuring velocity, comparing the sprint performance to previous sprints, etc.

The project manager should frequently join the remote conferencing rooms to ensure that the project team is actually working and not wasting time chit-chatting.

Explanation
The project manager should act as a servant leader, which means they shouldn’t control their team by frequently joining the conferencing rooms.

The project manager should measure the team’s velocity during the following sprint, and in case of any decrease, the project manager should discontinue the use of the new practices.

Explanation
The project manager should not make unilateral decisions.

The project manager should ask for the product owner’s approval to use these two practices.

A project manager is managing a project for a startup that needs to quickly deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to capture an opportunity in the market.



What should the project manager do?

Deliver a perfect product to ensure end users’ satisfaction

Explanation
Delivering a perfect product entails adopting a predictive or iterative approach, which doesn’t serve the business objective to launch fast.

Opt for an iterative approach to allow early feedback

Explanation
The concern of the startup is the fast delivery, not the product’s correctness or feedback.

Eliminate change requests to deliver fast

Explanation
Adopting a predictive approach won’t help the startup to launch fast, and eliminating change requests is not appropriate as they could be necessary in some cases.

Correct answer
Split deliverables into increments

Explanation
The project manager should opt for an incremental approach. Therefore, the project manager has to split deliverables into increments and ensure that the first increment has the necessary features to launch in the market and seize the opportunity.

When the sprint is almost over, one of the team members informs the project manager that they don't have enough time to properly prepare the demonstration for the sprint review since they’re trying to complete the sprint backlog items.



What could the project manager suggest in order to avoid such an issue in future sprints?

Correct answer
Creating a task for conducting the demonstration

Handling the demonstration instead of the team member

Delivering the demonstration without any preparation

Delaying the demonstration for a few days to allow the team to get properly prepared

Overall explanation
The creation of a task for the product demonstration and making it part of the sprint allows the team to dedicate the needed time to properly prepare for the demonstration. However, you should keep in mind that the sprint demo shouldn’t take up too much of the team’s time. Time shouldn’t be spent putting long slide decks together, for instance. Team members should focus on their work and only include stories that meet the team’s Definition of Done in the demonstration. Typically, a day or two before the end of the sprint, the project manager should hold a short demo run-through to give their notes on the things the team needs to set up in order to properly perform the demonstration.

A project manager is in charge of a construction project. The project manager receives an email from the quality control team stating that they’re having numerous issues with one of the project vendors.



What should the project manager do next?

Penalize the vendor

Correct answer
​Set up a meeting with the vendor and the control quality team

​Terminate the contract and discuss with the control quality team the selection criteria of a new vendor

​Raise the issue to the sponsor

Overall explanation
First and foremost, the project manager should be proactive and try to resolve the conflict between the quality control team and the vendor and work out a solution.



Options A & C: If this doesn't work, and the conflict still continues to exist, the project manager should consider other options such as taking disciplinary actions or even terminating the contract to avoid potential future damage.



Option D: Raising the issue to the sponsor is not an appropriate course of action since it’s the project manager’s responsibility to deal with conflicts and problems encountered throughout the project. Yet, an exception can be made when the decision is beyond the project manager's authority and power, which is not the case here.

A project manager oversees an agile project for developing a mobile application for a fast-paced startup. The project involves a cross-functional team comprising developers, designers, and testers. As the project progresses, the project manager encounters various challenges such as technological complexities, stakeholder communication gaps, and collaboration issues.



What should be the project manager’s primary focus to ensure the team remains aligned with agile principles?

Ensuring the team delivers new features as frequently as possible.

Explanation
Delivering features frequently enables rapid feedback and adaptation, which is indeed crucial in agile projects. However, the agile team should mainly focus on delivering value with each new feature instead of focusing only on the delivery frequency.

Establishing accurate and detailed plans to guide the team's work and minimize communication and quality issues.

Explanation
Creating detailed and accurate plans is a common practice in predictive projects which is not the case in this scenario.

Implementing rigorous quality control measures to ensure the application meets the highest standards of performance and usability.

Explanation
Implementing quality control measures does not directly address the mentioned challenges. Besides, agile calls for progressive elaboration and continuous improvements; the first of the agile 12 principles states: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Correct answer
Prioritizing the delivery of features that directly contribute to the client's goals and provide tangible value to end-users.

Explanation
Delivering value should always be the agile team’s top priority as it represents one of the agile manifesto principles: “working software over comprehensive documentation”. From the client’s perspective, value represents the benefit derived from using a product or a service.

Midway through the execution phase of a construction project, a key team member requests a two-month leave for personal reasons.



What should the project manager do first?

Find a replacement

Correct answer
​Evaluate the impact of the team member’s leave on the project

Persuade the team member to take several short leaves over the remaining project duration instead

​Ask the team member to postpone their leave

Overall explanation
The first thing the project manager should do in this situation is to understand what impact this leave will have on the project. For instance, a two-month leave may not have a big impact on a 3-year project, but it will have a significant impact on a 6-month project, especially if this team member is a key player.

Options C & D: After evaluating the impact, the project manager can ask the team member to postpone their leave or split it into shorter leaves over the project duration.



Option A: If the impact of the team member’s leave is still significant, even with these two solutions, then the project manager may need to seek a replacement.

A project manager is about to subcontract the installation of the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The project manager is currently looking into the payment structures and terms that will be used throughout the life of the contract.



When should the project manager choose a Time & Material contract instead of a Fixed Price contract? (Select two)

When the goal is to limit cost risks

Correct selection
When the scope is barely defined

Correct selection
When the work duration is not determined

When the scope is precisely defined

When the subcontractor requests its usage

Overall explanation
A Time & Material (T&M) contract is an agreement in which the contractor is paid on the basis of the actual labor cost (in hourly rates – man-hour) in addition to any materials and equipment usage. This contract type is used when there is no firm scope, or the work duration is not determined (i.e. ongoing development of the product) (PMBOK 7th edition, page 153).



Option A: In a Fixed Price contract, the subcontractor will either make a profit if they can install HVAC for less than the lump sum value, or they will lose money if they cannot install HVAC for the predetermined value. This transfers a significant amount of risk to the subcontractor.



Option D: A lump sum contract, Fixed Price, is used when the scope is clear.



Option E: The project manager has to choose the payment structure that suits the project needs, regardless of what the subcontract wants.

The senior member believes that the new member lacks the technical proficiency to properly accomplish their assigned work. Having worked together for several years, the project manager has confidence in the senior team member’s judgment.



What should the project manager do?

Release the new team member

Nothing should be done since the new team member has already been assigned

Correct answer
Provide the new member with training and mentoring

Keep the new team member, but reassign their tasks to someone else

Overall explanation
The project manager should provide the new member with the needed training and mentoring. When you realize a team member lacks the required competencies or skills, the first step is to use mentorship and training in order to improve their competencies (PMBOK 7th edition, page 18).



Option A: Releasing the team member should be the last resort when every other option fails to put them on track.



Options B & D: Doing nothing or reassigning their tasks to someone else will not help the team member improve their competency; it will only lead to their demotivation and negatively impact the project.

Ask the team to just finish the work in progress and then terminate the sprint

Correct answer
Immediately cancel the sprint

Ask the product owner to provide a clear explanation of their decision in order to cancel the sprint

Overall explanation
The product owner has the authority to cancel an ongoing sprint for any reason they think is valid. There is no sense to continue working on something that is not needed anymore. The project manager should terminate the sprint immediately, but they need to do their best to understand what caused this extreme decision; dissatisfaction, obsolete sprint backlog items, canceled project, etc.

Implement daily stand-up meetings to enhance communication and collaboration

Encourage self-organization and decision-making within the team

Break down project deliverables into smaller, manageable increments

Correct answer
Use a Kanban framework to optimize workflow and identify bottlenecks

Overall explanation
The Kanban method involves pulling work into the system only when the team is capable of handling it. The Kanban method prioritizes productivity and efficiency through its workflow approach. The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and less disruptive. A Kanban board helps the team to further improve its effectiveness by visualizing the flow of work, making impediments easily visible. (Agile Practice Guide pages 13 & 31).

While controlling the project execution, the project manager uncovers scope creep caused by a key stakeholder. When checking the Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix, the project manager finds out that the stakeholder is classified as “leading”.



What should the project manager do?

Nothing, since the scope creep was caused by a key stakeholder

Explanation
Any change to the scope baseline, even if initiated by a key stakeholder, must follow the formal approval process.

Reverse the scope change since the project manager didn’t approve it

Explanation
Undoing the changes without referring to the CCB means the project manager is going to perform additional work that is not part of the scope, resulting in further scope creep; That’s why they need approval from CCB.

Correct answer
Take the scope creep to the change control board

Explanation
The scope creep needs to go through the formal channel by reporting it to the change control board and decide with them on the appropriate course of action (PMBOK 7th edition, page 87).

Nothing, since changes made by leading stakeholders could only have a positive impact on the project

At the end of a sprint retrospective, a team member stated that the meeting output is almost the same as the previous ones and suggested canceling it or at least reducing its frequency.



What should the project manager do?

Extend the sprint timebox in order to allow for more improvements to be discussed in the retrospective

Reduce the frequency of retrospectives to once every two sprints

Go with voting, and if all team members agree, then skip retrospectives

Correct answer
Keep the same frequency of retrospectives and reflect on how to make them more relevant and actionable

Overall explanation
The sprint retrospective is one of the main scrum events, which aims to help the team adjust and improve their work processes over time. The project manager has to better facilitate the meeting, engage team members, solicit and collect more feedback, check various metrics, and use different investigation techniques such as the why-why method to help them take future actionable measures accordingly.



Option A: Extending the sprint timebox denotes smoothing the problem rather than trying to solve it.

During the sprint planning, the development team estimated a task to be worth “8” story points, while the product owner’s estimation for the same task was “3” story points. Therefore, the scrum master decided to assign this task “5” story points to bridge the gap between the two estimations.



What did the scrum master do wrong in this scenario?

The scrum master should provide their estimate before making a final decision since estimates should be assigned by the entire Scrum team

The scrum master should assign “5.5” story points to the task as an average of both estimates

The scrum master should assign “3” story points to the task since the product owner is the one responsible for assigning estimates

Correct answer
The scrum master should assign “8” story points to the task since the development team is responsible for assigning estimates

Overall explanation
Assigning estimates is the responsibility of the development team who is going to execute the task. Since the team’s estimation was “8”, then the task should be assigned “8” story points.

After getting the client's approval that the project scope is met, the project manager delivers the signs to the installation company. The latter asks the project manager to help them with the signs’ installation.



What should the project manager do?

Submit a change request to assist with the signs’ installation

Explanation
The signs production project is completed therefore submitting a change request doesn’t make sense.

Do a favor for the installation company and help them out

Explanation
The signs’ installation is not part of the project therefore no further steps are required.

Create a new separate project charter for the signs installation support to make it clear that it’s not part of the initial project

Explanation
A company is already assigned to install the signs so there is no need to create a new project charter.

Correct answer
Do nothing since the project scope has been officially fulfilled and approved by the client

A project manager is leading a big project with team members of different cultural backgrounds and nationalities. The multilingual team members use English in their day-to-day communication as they can speak it fluently.



What should the project manager take into consideration?

Due to cultural differences, the project manager should consider creating a separate code of conduct for each nationality.

The project manager have to accept that some team members may have some conflicts when working with colleagues of other nationalities.

Correct answer
The project manager should take into account that spoken communication may give rise to certain misunderstandings that may not occur in written communications.

The project manager should keep in mind that some team members won’t mind late-night meetings and video conferences.

Overall explanation
The project manager should bear in mind that spoken communication can lead to misunderstandings that may not occur when using written communication. Intercultural communication commonly entails communicating in a foreign language. Fluently speaking a foreign language is not always enough to fully grasp it. In order to develop intercultural communication skills, comprehending both the language and its cultural context is required.

During the sprint retrospective, the project manager should identify what went well during the sprint and what can be done differently in the next sprint. A possible topic is the timing of the standup. If team members are showing dissatisfaction with the current schedule, then the retrospective meeting is the right event to discuss the issue.



Options A & B: The sprint planning meeting is the right meeting for discussing which tasks should be prioritized in the next sprint and how to decompose user stories into manageable tasks.

What should the project manager do?

Ask the project team to skip small requirements so that they can only focus on big and important ones.

Explanation
Requirements shouldn’t be skipped, small or big.

Correct answer
Ensure that all alterations to the scope are authorized through a formal process.

Explanation
The project manager can avoid scope creep by adhering to the agreed-upon change management process. Change management processes have to be set up front and should be very straightforward. Essentially, when a change is suggested, it should be reviewed, approved or rejected, and then incorporated into the project plan if it’s approved (PMBOK 7th edition, page 87).

Prevent stakeholders from directly interacting with the project team.

Explanation
Often, it’s not appropriate to prevent the stakeholders from communicating with the project team.

After explaining the meaning behind their choice for the different elements of the logo, the senior graphic designer solicited feedback. The product owner appreciated the logo, while the majority of the cross-functional team noted that the logo icon would look better if it was 20% bigger. However, the Scrum Master thinks that a 10% size increase would be enough to make the logo look better.



Which of the following decisions should be ultimately considered?

The icon size should be increased by 20% as per the recommendation of the majority of the cross-functional team

The icon size should be increased by 10% as per the recommendation of the Scrum master

Correct answer
The icon size should not be increased since the product owner was pleased with the result

The icon size should not be increased since the senior graphic designer is the one qualified to take decisions when it comes to design

Overall explanation
The product owner is the one responsible for accepting or rejecting the demonstrated product increment during the iteration review meeting. This means that the icon size should not be increased.



Options A & B: The icon size should not be increased since the product owner didn’t ask for any modifications.

Which conflict resolution technique is being used in this situation?

Collaborating

Explanation
The situation is not “collaborating” since the scenario did not involve different points of view and perspectives on how the issue should be addressed.

Correct answer
Confronting

Explanation
The two team members used confronting as a conflict resolution technique, which is also known as problem-solving. This technique is used when conflicting parties focus on finding the best solution while having confidence in each other’s judgment and ability to solve the issue (PMBOK 7th edition, page 168).

Which of the following documents will address how the change in the subcontractor's workload will be handled?

The Change Control System

Explanation
The Change Control System describes how modifications to the project deliverables and documentation are managed and controlled. However, if the modifications impacts the work of a subcontractor, then the project manager should review the change clause of the corresponding contract.

The Procurement Management Plan

Explanation
The Procurement Management Plan is used to define the process of what, when, and how to acquire material or services from third parties. Yet, it doesn’t define the contractual engagement with each of them.

Correct answer
The contract

Explanation
Any changes to any of the predetermined contract terms between the subcontractor and the project manager, including the defined scope of work, should be addressed in the contract.

Since switching to the agile approach, a project manager has been encouraging their team to be self-organizing by allowing them to decide on how to execute their assigned work.



What is the main aspect of a self-organizing team?

It gives more responsibility to the project manager

Correct answer
It gives more responsibility to the Agile team

It allows the team to deliver a working product without external dependencies

It gives team members higher visibility of the product

Overall explanation
Unlike conventional teams, self-organizing teams do not wait for their supervisors to assign them tasks. Instead, they determine which tasks must be accomplished, prioritize those tasks, and handle their schedules and deadlines on their own. Self-organizing teams tend to have a greater sense of ownership, engagement, and responsibility (PMBOK 7th edition, page 249).

One month into the project, the sponsor contacts the project manager to express dissatisfaction with the project work. The sponsor says that the deliverables don’t match neither the requirements nor the set expectations.



What should the project manager do?

Continue working on the next deliverable to finish the project on time.

Talk to management to discuss the sponsor’s concerns.

​Ensure that the next deliverables have enough features to meet the client’s expectations.

Correct answer
Perform a scope control to verify if the deliverables meet the project objectives.

Overall explanation
​Project scope verification or control involves reviewing deliverables to make sure that each is appropriately completed as per requirements. Any discovered inconsistency or dissimilarity should be rectified before seeking the sponsor’s formal approval through the “validate scope” process.

Question 143
Skipped
After purchasing a new software needed for the project, a project manager identifies a potential risk; the bought version might be old. In case that risk occurs, the project manager will just need to go to the settings and update the software version. Therefore, the project manager decides to passively accept the risk.



In this case, why is passive risk acceptance the appropriate approach?



Because the probability of risk occurrence is very low

Because the risk occurrence is difficult to identify

Correct answer
Because it’s better to deal with trivial risks when they occur

Because the risk is not on the critical path

Overall explanation
Passive risk acceptance is an appropriate approach when it is best to handle the risk when it does occur. No proactive action is needed for passive acceptance other than periodically reviewing the threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly (PMBOK 7th edition, page 123).

Question 144
Skipped
The project manager recently learned that one of the senior team members will be promoted to manage a new project within the organization. When this happens, the project manager will lose a valuable member in the team.



What should the project manager do next?



Try to influence management to delay the team member’s promotion until the project is completed.

​Inform the team member about the promotion and ask them to transfer their responsibilities to another team member.

Correct answer
​Ask the team member to prepare a transition plan once they get officially promoted and receive their transfer order.

Acquire another resource to replace the team member.

Overall explanation
Transitions and changes of roles are all common occurrences in a project. Therefore, creating a transition plan can ensure the smooth functioning of the project during times of change. A transition plan outlines the hand-off process and defines all the priorities, goals, and strategies for a successful shift. However, the project manager can only ask the team member to prepare this plan when the promotion becomes official through a transfer order, for instance.



Option A: Influence management to delay the team member’s promotion until the project is completed is not appropriate. It will negatively impact the morale of the team member.



Options B & D: Transferring responsibilities or hiring other resources should not be based on a mere possibility.

Question 145
Skipped
During a bidder conference, a supplier brought to the project manager’s attention a missing requirement in the Request For Proposal (RFP). When checking the RFP, the project manager realized that the supplier was right. Therefore, the project manager made sure to talk about this particular requirement and its acceptance criteria for 15 minutes to ensure that all attending suppliers were fully aware of it. When sellers’ responses were received, only one prospective supplier addressed the missing requirement.



What should the project manager do next?

Retain the supplier who noticed the missing requirement

Retain the supplier who addressed the missing requirement in their response

Extend the deadline to receive more proposals and have more choices

Correct answer
Send an adjusted RFP comprising the missing requirement to all suppliers and give them the opportunity to resubmit their proposals

Overall explanation
Sending the altered RFP to all suppliers, highlighting the requirement that was previously missing, and allowing them to send updated responses to the RFP would be fair to all suppliers. Moreover, in this situation, formal written communication is highly recommended as verbal communication might be misunderstood or forgotten.



Option C: Extending the deadline without re-issuing the RFP will not address the issue.

Question 146
Skipped
After sizing the selected product backlog items for the next release, the product owner estimated that 5 sprints are needed to complete the release. However, after two sprints, the project manager finds out that the velocity of the team has declined for various reasons, which means that the release deadline won’t be met.



What should the project manager do next?



Re-prioritize the backlog

Explanation
The agile project manager should not reprioritize the backlog. It’s the product owner's responsibility.

Add more members to the team

Explanation
Adding more members or developers to the team may increase the velocity, but it will increase costs as well. Plus, this option should be approved by the product owner, and could only be adopted when meeting the release deadline and finishing its scope are more important than costs.

Decompose user stories to increase the velocity of the team

Explanation
Decomposing user stories cannot result in more productivity nor increase the team’s velocity since the amount of work will still be the same.

Correct answer
Discuss the issue with the product owner to find the appropriate solution

Explanation
The project manager should inform the product owner and discuss with them the different options and measures. If the release date cannot be changed then the product owner could re-prioritize the release backlog.

Question 147
Skipped
During a meeting with 15 stakeholders, the product owner was discussing and collecting ideas about the product requirements. Since there were a lot of suggested ideas, the product owner decided to vote. After voting, the product owner found that a particular idea received 9 votes, so the product owner went with that option.



What type of decision-making does this depict?



Unanimity

Correct answer
Majority

Plurality

Dictatorship

Overall explanation
Voting is a technique for collective decision-making which can be used to generate and prioritize project requirements. Unanimity, plurality, and majority are examples of voting techniques. A majority decision requires being supported by more than 50% of the group members.

Question 148
Skipped
A project manager is leading a software project. A team member is in charge of developing the User Interface (UI). Even though this member is doing a great job, their work pace is way slower than expected, which can cause the whole project to miss its deadline.



What should the project manager do first in this situation?



Delegate some of the team member’s tasks to other team members

Explanation
If it turns out that the concerned team member is overallocated, it might be better to assign some of their work to other members.

Remove the team member from the project

Explanation
Regardless of their slow work pace, the concerned team member is doing a great job. Therefore, removing them from the project can have a negative impact on the quality of the deliverables.

Correct answer
Find out the cause of the team member’s slow work pace

Explanation
Before taking any corrective measures, the project manager should determine the underlying cause of the problem.

Give the concerned team member other non-critical tasks

Explanation
Assigning non-critical tasks to the team member can have a bad impact on their motivation, plus it does not resolve the main problem, i.e. their slow work pace.

This document only explains how to create the change processes, and doesn’t include the change processes themselves.

Correct answer
The change control system

Explanation
The Change Control System is a set of procedures that describes how modifications to the project deliverables and documentation are managed and controlled (PMBOK 7th edition, page 237).

The organizational process assets

Explanation

A project manager must assign a complex task to one of the team members. The project manager had to choose between two members who were both equally capable of fulfilling the task. But, the project manager had a closer relationship with one of them than the other.



What should the project manager do?



Correct answer
Disclose the situation to the appropriate stakeholders and solicit a joint decision.

Choose the one that the project manager has a closer relationship with since that type of trust can benefit the project.

Choose the member the project manager is not close to in order to avoid misunderstandings.

Ask a third team member to take the decision in order to avoid a conflict of interest.

The project manager should use methodical steps to perform problem-solving. These steps include:

Identifying or specifying the problem.

Defining the problem and breaking it into smaller manageable problems.

Investigating by collecting data.

Analyzing to detect the root cause of the problem.

Solving by choosing the suitable solution.

Checking the implemented solution to determine whether the problem has been fixed or not.

What should the project manager do to raise the team's productivity?

Increase the pressure on each team member to meet deadlines.

Conduct daily performance reviews to keep the team focused and motivated.

Offer a special reward for the best-performing team member.

Correct answer
Improve and promote trust and cohesiveness among team members.

Overall explanation
Improving feelings of trust and cohesiveness among team members improves productivity. Team cohesion is when people feel fulfilled and driven to achieve a common goal. Therefore, working on increasing cohesion among the team through the establishment of positive relationships, team goals, and shared values increases team members' commitment and helps boost their engagement.

Which of the following point-in-time measurements can the project manager use to answer the sponsor’s inquiries? (Select two)

Product backlog

Correct selection
Feature burnup chart

Sprint burndown chart

Correct selection
Lead time

Overall explanation
Feature burnup and burndown charts, lead time, and cycle time provide in-the-moment measurements, giving insight into the team’s capacity and the schedule’s predictability. Lead time is the duration between task creation and task completion. Cycle time, however, is the duration between the moment the team starts working on a user story and the moment it gets delivered to the end user.



Option A: The product backlog is not a measurement, it’s rather a list of the work that needs to be done to develop the final product.



Option C: The Sprint burndown chart shows progress of the sprint level, not the project level.

Based on the below iteration burndown chart, at which period of the iteration did the team take the spike?





A

Correct answer
B

C

D

Overall explanation
A spike is a time-boxed activity aimed at addressing a technical challenge or mitigating risks. Spikes usually result in a temporary slowdown or pause in the team's velocity as they allocate time for research or exploration. Analyzing the provided burndown chart, you can observe slow progress at the beginning of the iteration followed by a light pause starting Day 2 to Day 4, followed by a resumption of the downward trend. This deviation indicates the time allocated for the spike to address the technical challenge.

Question 156
Skipped
A project manager is leading the development of a new software project. The project manager wants to adopt an approach that produces key deliverables at various stages of the project.



What should the project manager do?

Create a detailed project schedule with key milestones to track progress against the plan.

Explanation
Creating a detailed project schedule with key milestones means adopting a predictive approach and only delivering at the end of the project.

Correct answer
Deliver incremental results that can be added to the subsequent results.

Explanation
Delivering partial results at various intervals refers to the incremental approach. In this type of development approach, the project is divided into increments which are successively delivered to avoid waiting for everything to be completed in order to create a solution (PMBOK 7th edition, page 241).

Organize frequent review meetings with project stakeholders to gather feedback and adjust project direction.

Explanation
Organizing review meetings to gather feedback and adjust project direction is a main aspect of the iterative approach. The iterative approach focuses on correctness. It typically include multiple essays and one acceptable deliverable at the end of the project.

Adopt an iterative approach in order to deliver the highest business value earlier.

Explanation
Deliver the highest business value earlier is the aspect of the incremental approach, not the iterative approach. The incremental approach focuses on speed, while the iterative approach focus on correctness.

By the end of the third iteration, a project manager delivered the website to the customer and signed a maintenance contract to fix any issues that might occur. On the first day of the maintenance contract period, the customer reported an error on the contact page when using a smartphone. After verifying the issue with the project team, the project manager realizes that testing the contact feature on mobile was omitted.



What should the project manager do next?

Reopen the project and fix the error since testing the contact feature on mobile was omitted.

Ask the sponsor to submit a formal change request with an anterior date in order to be considered a part of the project.

Correct answer
Request from the project team to fix the issue according to the maintenance contract.

Do nothing since the error is discovered after the formal closure of the project.

Overall explanation
An escaped defect is one that was not detected by the project team but rather discovered by the customer or end-user after the product is released. These defects are usually covered by a maintenance contract. Therefore, the project manager should request from the project team to fix the issue according to the maintenance contract.

This is the first time the project manager adopts the scrum framework for the project execution. One of the team members asks the project manager when a Sprint is considered completed.



What should be the project manager’s response?

When all product backlog items are completed

When all the tasks in the sprint are completed

Correct answer
When the sprint’s defined timebox ends

When all product backlog items meet the Definition of Done (DoD)

Overall explanation
A sprint is considered complete only when it reaches the end of its duration/timebox, which is usually 1 to 4 weeks.



Option B: In some cases, the sprint ends without finishing all of the assigned tasks, so this can’t be the criteria for sprint completion.

A project manager is facing some challenges because of a key stakeholder. The project manager collaborated with this stakeholder in previous projects where the latter frequently changed the requirements and created trouble whenever those requirements were not met.



How should the project manager deal with this issue?

Adopt an Agile approach

Correct answer
Involve the concerned stakeholder right from the start

Ask the concerned stakeholder to mend their ways

Inform management about the issue

Overall explanation
The project manager should involve the key stakeholder from the very beginning of the project to help reduce and uncover risks, as well as increase their “buy-in.”



Option A: While implementing an agile approach may benefit the project, it does not address the issue of stakeholder management. If the question were “what’s the appropriate approach for the project?”, then adopting an agile approach would be the right answer taking into consideration the frequently changing requirements.

A project manager is managing a software development project which was planned to last three months. Throughout the entire project, progress aligned with the planned schedule. However, one day before the delivery deadline, a team member discovered a bug that could cause a one-week delay.



What should the project manager do next?



Inform the stakeholders that there is a bug that requires 2 to 3 days to fix and put more pressure on the team to fix it within that time frame.

Correct answer
Inform the stakeholders about the situation and that it may take a week to resolve the bug.

Update the lessons learned and add them to the organizational process assets.

Close the project since the project end date is reached.

Overall explanation
As soon as it becomes obvious that the project will be delayed, the project manager should notify the client and present them with new alternatives. The project manager should be honest and transparent about delays. Under the RESPONSIBILITY section of the PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, page 3: When the project manager discovers errors or omissions caused by others, they should communicate them to the appropriate body as soon as they are discovered. Under the HONESTY section, page 6: the project manager should provide accurate information in a timely manner.

A project manager is leading a software development project using a hybrid approach. During project execution, the sponsor left the project and a new sponsor was assigned. When the project manager informed the new sponsor that the deliverables were produced using a hybrid project management approach, the sponsor asked for proof.



How should the project manager address the new sponsor's request?



Correct selection
Submit a change request to fix the resulting regressions.

Correct selection
Inform the concerned stakeholders about the regressions, their impact, and the proposed solutions.

Correct selection
Set up a lessons-learned meeting to avoid similar issues in the future.

Since it’s an internal problem, try to fix it without the customer’s notice.

Ignore the regressions and focus on completing the project as scheduled.

Overall explanation
When issues occur, the right course of action implies informing the client of what happened, suggesting potential solutions for the issue, and then submitting a change request. This is aligned with the philosophy stating “don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions” (PMBOK 7th edition, page 28). Later on, when the issue is fixed, a lessons-learned meeting should be conducted to avoid similar problems in the future.

During the sprint planning, the team decomposed a user story into four tasks. When working on the user story, a team member identified a fifth task. What should the team member do?

Correct answer
Update the user story and work on the new task

Explanation
The project team is responsible for how to do the work. Therefore, if a new task is identified within the user story it could be immediately added.

Report the issue to the Scrum Master

Explanation
The situation doesn’t involve any issue. The team member can add, adjust, or remove tasks in order to deliver the user story according to its acceptance criteria.

Request from the product owner to approve the new task

Explanation
The new task doesn’t require the product owner's approval since it’s a technical component of an agreed upon user story.

Add the task to the product backlog

A data science project manager is used to implement projects with the hybrid approach. Her organization owns two servers for manipulating big data, with one server being more performant than the other. After a meeting with a potential client, the project manager informed her superior that if this project is approved, she would like to use the organization’s performant server and have the senior developer, Adam, as part of the project team.



Does the project manager have the right to make such a request?



Correct answer
Yes, project managers can pre-assign resources if they need to.

Explanation
Resources can be identified as early as the Initiating phase, often through pre-assignment or resource negotiations. Pre-assignment might include the team members who have already been identified in Develop Project Charter Process (Initiating process group) or other processes before the initial resource management plan has been completed (PMI Process Groups, page 214).



Yes, competition over resources is common so project managers should be proactive in reserving them.

Explanation
Consequently, resource pre-assignment should be employed for a good reason, not just because there is competition over these resources.

No, project managers cannot pre-assign resources before conducting the resource planning.

Explanation
Pre-assignment can take place before the initial resource management planning is complete.

No, in hybrid projects it’s the product owner’s responsibility to acquire and develop resources.

Skip the standup meeting and attend the business meeting instead.

Ask the cross-functional team to postpone the standup meeting.

Cancel the standup meeting.

Ask the cross-functional team to record the standup meeting in order to watch it later.

Overall explanation
The Scrum Master should ensure that the cross-functional team holds the standup meeting every day as planned, but they are not required to attend it. The development team is responsible for conducting the standup meeting.

An organization is used to following the scrum framework where sprints are 4 weeks long. One day, the organization’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) approached the scrum master and argued that a 4-week sprint is too long and it would be better to reduce it to 2 weeks.



Convinced by the CTO’s suggestion, how could the Scrum Master make this change?



Announce to the entire Scrum team that the CTO, who has formal power, has decided that the sprint should only last 2 weeks.

Correct answer
Let the product owner and the team members know about the intention to reduce the sprint length and involve them in the decision.

Inform the team of the sprint length change during the sprint retrospective and provide them with arguments.

Engage an agile coach to assist in this transition since having someone external to the team will most likely reduce any resistance.

Overall explanation
The scrum master needs to make sure to involve the entire team or whoever the change is likely to impact when tailoring a process (Agile Practice Guide, page 120). The buy-in from the team will suffer significantly if one person defines the process especially if they are from outside the team such as an agile coach.

Correct selection
Buy a ping pong table and allow the team to use it during breaks.

Correct selection

A project manager is in charge of an educational project. After analyzing the power level of each of the project’s four stakeholders, the project manager finds out that Monica and Markus have high power, while Ravi and Sergio have low power. For a deeper insight, the project manager created the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix below.



Based on this analysis, which stakeholder should be prioritized in terms of engagement?


Monica

Correct answer
Markus

Ravi

Sergio

Overall explanation
The priority in engagement should be given to stakeholders with a high level of power (PMBOK 7th edition, page 12). Monica and Markus have high power, but Monica is Neutral, while Markus is unaware. Having an unaware stakeholder with a high level of power is more dangerous than a neutral stakeholder with a high level of power since the first type can cause a lot of trouble when they become aware at a late stage of the project. The project manager should prioritize engaging Markus by sharing the project details with him. Then, they should try to win his support and bring him to the leading level if possible.



Options A & D: Monica and Sergio should be the project manager’s second priority. It’s preferable to have either supportive or leading high-power stakeholders. So, the project manager needs to make more effort to bring Monica to one of these two levels. On the other hand, even though Sergio has low power, the project manager needs to work on moving him out from the resistant level since his level of power can change at any time throughout the project.

A project manager developed the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by decomposing the work into three levels. The supportive PMO points out that three levels are not enough and recommends breaking down project work into five levels instead.



What should the project manager do?



Correct answer
Take into consideration the PMO’s recommendation and decompose work as needed.

Establish common ground by decomposing the WBS into four levels instead.

Since the PMO has a high level of control, the project manager should decompose the WBS into five levels as recommended.

Since the PMO has a low level of control, the project manager should ignore their request and keep the WBS decomposition levels at three.

Overall explanation
The details and level of decomposition of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) depend on the project size, complexity, and level of control needed to effectively manage the project.



Options B, C, D: There’s no standard or a predefined number of decomposition levels. A supportive PMO has limited control over the project, meaning the project manager should consider their advice and recommendations, but is not required to follow them.

Explanation
In the case of unclear work assignments or work progress, the project manager should help their team by using a Kanban board to display the flow of work (Agile Practice Guide, page 58). A kanban board could be already used, but team members might not be updating it properly; they’re not self-assigning tasks or they’re not moving work items to the right column. The project manager should ensure that all team members know how to properly handle the kanban board.

Send a daily status report to all team members to remove the impediment.

Explanation
Even though the problem raised by the team is considered an impediment, it’s not practical for the project manager to solve it by sending a daily status report to everyone.

The project manager shouldn’t do anything since agile teams are self-organizing.

Explanation
Self-organizing teams work autonomously by assuming responsibility for achieving the product increment. However, they still need the project manager's help to adjust work processes and support them so that they can focus on achieving deliverables without interruptions or hindrances.

Question 175
Skipped
In order to ensure that the agile team is cross-functional, a project manager hires a new team member who is more inclined towards testing tasks. After a few days, the new member informs the project manager that he is unable to do his work properly because he doesn’t have the necessary permission to access part of the code.



What should the project manager do next?



Ask the team member to raise the issue during the retrospective meeting.

Explanation
Retrospective meetings are set up to improve processes rather than remove impediments.

Tell the team member to adjust the acceptance criteria of the pending tasks and then inform the product owner.

Explanation
If the new member’s permission can’t be changed, the project manager should explain this to them and to the product owner in order to update the tasks’ acceptance criteria.

Explain to the team member that he cannot access the whole code due to security restrictions.

Explanation
It could be for security reasons, or because the concerned stakeholder is unaware of the nature of the new member’s duties. In an Agile work environment, a project manager should listen to their team members and act to solve the impediments they’re facing.

Correct answer
Reach out to the appropriate stakeholder to either confirm or update the team member’s privilege.

Explanation
Being a servant leader, the project manager should reach out to the appropriate stakeholder in order to verify why the new member doesn’t have access to that portion of the code.

Question 176
Skipped
During a sprint review meeting, a team member demonstrated a new feature and pointed out that it took longer than expected due to missing technical documentation. Then, the team member asked a senior member how to avoid this in the future.



What should the meeting facilitator do?



Let the discussion flow naturally since it’s important and only intervene if the side discussion continues for too long.

Correct answer
Ask the team member to reflect on how to make such improvements at another meeting.

Interrupt the team member because the product owner is not supposed to know that documentation is missing.

Let the discussion continue and then ask the product owner to give feedback on potential improvements.

Overall explanation
The retrospective meeting is the right meeting to reflect on what happened during the sprint and how to improve the implemented processes. Therefore, rather than discussing how to improve future work efficiency, the meeting facilitator should steer back the discussion to only focus on the demonstrated feature and get the product owner’s feedback on what has been produced. This being said, if the documentation needs improvement, team members should create a technical task for it and demonstrate its importance to the product owner during Sprint Planning.

Question 177
Skipped
During the sprint, the scrum master asked two senior members whether the remaining work in the sprint backlog could be completed to achieve the sprint goal. The team members replied by saying that they were not supposed to track such data.



What should the scrum master do next?



Take disciplinary action against the two team members.

Take charge of tracking the sprint backlog progress.

Correct answer
Inform the two team members that tracking sprint backlog is the responsibility of the development team and guide them through the process.

Ask the two team members about the sprint backlog progress during the next standup instead.

Overall explanation
The scrum master needs to coach the two senior team members and bring to their attention that the scrum team is responsible for tracking the total work remaining in the sprint backlog as an indicator of whether or not they will achieve the sprint goal.



Option B: In order to get a clear idea about the sprint backlog progress, the scrum master can simply check the burndown chart, but it’s not their responsibility to continuously track the sprint backlog work progress.



Option D: The project manager can also attend the standup meeting in order to detect any bottlenecks and help tackle and remove them.

Question 178
Skipped
A stakeholder added a user story to the product backlog. The user story seemed clear to the scrum team. However, during execution, the assigned member gets confused about one of its implementation scenarios.



What should the team member do in this case?



Ask the stakeholder for clarification.

Explanation
The product owner represents the customer and stakeholders, which means that the development team should refer only to the product owner if they have any inquiries.

Correct answer
Ask the product owner for clarification.

Explanation
During sprint execution, the product owner should be available to respond to questions raised by the development team.



Convey the confusion to the scrum master, who will help get clarification from the product owner.

Explanation
Since the blocker concerns the clarification of a user story, the development team can reach out directly to the product owner without the intermediation of the scrum master. In agile, the development team is self-organizing, thus they’re responsible for ensuring the achievement of the sprint work.

Wait for the next standup meeting to report the issue to the scrum master or product owner if they do attend the meeting.

Explanation
Waiting till the next standup meeting to get clarifications is not proactive and can reflect a lack of ownership.

Question 179
Skipped
Shortly after joining a new organization, a project manager noticed a lack of collaboration within the team.



What should the project manager do to create a cooperative work environment?



Conduct soft skills development training

Explanation
Carrying out soft-skills training could improve your team’s ability to better communicate and collaborate, but it’s less effective compared to team-building activities.

Opt for a pull-based system for work assignments

Explanation
Opting for a pull-based system for work assignments, i.e., a lean or a Kanban method, has the main purpose of improving productivity and decreasing delivery times rather than promoting collaboration.

Correct answer
Organize team-building activities

Explanation
Team-building activities foster a cooperative working environment when continuously implemented throughout the project lifecycle and especially in its early stages when barely any relationships among team members are developed.



Adopt an agile work approach

Explanation
Following an agile approach should not be done just to increase collaboration among team members, as the project may not be suitable for such an approach in the first place.

Question 180
Skipped
An organization hires an external agile coach as part of its transformation project. In the final report, the agile coach mentions that measures should be taken to enable agile teams to be cross-functional.



How should the organization proceed with the agile coach recommendation?



Allow individuals to collectively determine the best way to accomplish the goal of the sprint.

Allow individuals to take part in guiding the product direction.

Correct answer
Assign individuals who possess the necessary skills to produce a functioning product.

Empower individuals to approve the potentially shippable product increment.

Overall explanation
A cross-functional team must possess the necessary competencies for creating a product or a service independently, without relying on other members outside of the team.



Option A: A self-organizing team is when individuals collectively determine the best way to accomplish the sprint goal.



Options B & D: The product owner is mainly responsible for guiding the product direction and approving the potentially shippable product increment.
