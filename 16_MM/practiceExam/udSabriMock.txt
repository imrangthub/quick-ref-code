##PRACTICE TEST 2
=============================================

Question 1
Skipped
Being the project manager, you are helping the sponsor to create the project charter. You are about to create a list of requirements for this purpose. Which of the following requirements will not be included in this list?

A) Plan payment to employees based on the pre-determined schedule

B) Ensure the privacy of employee data as required by laws

Correct answer
C) Determine the name list of all employees

D) Provide security of employee data

Overall explanation
Since you are creating this list for the project charter, only the high-level requirements should be included in this list. Determining the name list of employees is not a high-level requirement. Therefore, all of the options except C can be listed in the high-level requirements list.

Question 2
Skipped
During the project, the project manager realizes that the approved budget will not be sufficient to complete the project. He asked about cutting some costs of the project, but this request is rejected. Which of the following options may be the main reason for this rejection?

A) Cost baseline

B) The net present value of incomes and outcomes

C) Change in the management plan

Correct answer
D) Business case

Overall explanation
Since his request for cutting costs is rejected, we understand that there is something else more important than the budget. Among the answers, the business case will be the best option because it is the only option that may correspond to a more important value than cost.

Question 3
Skipped
After the project management plan is created, it should be approved by:

A) Functional managers providing the resources

B) Project management team

C) Sponsor

Correct answer
D) All of the above

Overall explanation
After creating the project management plan, formal approval of resource managers, project management team, and sponsor will be needed. Therefore, all of the options are correct.

Question 4
Skipped
One of the team members has been hired last week and she started working on the project. She is experienced enough for this position and she also has lots of other skills and these extra skills might be very helpful for the project. Although she satisfies all the skill sets identified by the client, she couldn’t start a specific work package today because to start working on this work package, she needs to know a technique that is being used by the project manager; but she doesn't know anything about this technique. Since she couldn’t start working on the work package today, it is clear that this will cause a project delay.

What is the primary reason for this delay?

A) Knowing this technique should have been listed as a skill in the skill set identified by the client

B) A contingency reserve should have been added for this risk

Correct answer
C) Stakeholder requirements should have been considered when hiring the team member

D) The project manager should have reviewed this team member’s skills before starting the work package

Overall explanation
Some requirements may not be identified by the client; therefore, a skill not listed in the skill set identified by the client cannot be the reason for the delay. All other options (options B, C, and D) may be the reason for this delay, but since we are looking for the primary reason, we need to find the root cause. A contingency reserve could have been prevented this delay, but this is not the primary reason. The project manager should have reviewed this team member’s skills before starting the work package, but if this team member had known this technique there would be no delay; in other words, this is not the root cause. If the project manager’s requirements had been considered when hiring the team member, they would not have such a problem. Because the project manager could have told them to add this skill to the skills list. (Please note that the project manager is a stakeholder).

Question 5
Skipped

Question 6
Skipped
Your company starts an IT project. This project will be completed in 24 months. Just after completing the project, you expect a $100,000 revenue. If the yearly interest rate is assumed to be 4%, what is the value of $100,000 as of today?

Correct answer
A) $92,455.62

B) $108,160

C) $51,020.41

D) $100,000

Overall explanation
Since today’s value is asked, we should calculate the Present Value (PV). Let’s remember the formula;  PV = FV / (1+r)n;  Here r = interest rate and n = number of time periods. FV is given as $100,000 r is given as 4%, therefore, it is 0.04. Please note that the interest rate is given as «yearly» but the time period is given as “months”. Therefore, first we need to convert it to “years”. 24 months / 12 = 2 years; Therefore n=2 So,  PV = 100,000 / (1 + 0.04)² PV = 100,000 / (1.04)² PV = $92,455.62

B) T-shaped people should be hired

C) Team members should be hired by considering cultural diversity

D) There should be people from different functions in the same team

Overall explanation
In the question, it says ‘They have created a high-level plan, and they plan to create detailed plans at the same time they create the deliverables’. Therefore, we understand that they will apply an agile approach, and in agile environments, we don’t have management plans. All other options are true.

Question 8
Skipped

Question 10
Skipped
In a very uncertain environment, the project teams are about to be established. The following information is known about four of the team members:

David: I-shaped, Highly-experienced in predictive environments, Has high technical skills

Sarah: T-shaped, Highly-experienced in agile environments, Has high technical skills

Jose: I-shaped, Experienced in predictive environments, Doesn’t have enough technical skills

Mia: T-shaped, Experienced in agile environments, Doesn’t have enough technical skills

There will be two different teams who will work on this project. Deploy these four members to these teams.

A) Team 1: David, Sarah - Team 2: Jose, Mia

B) Team 1: David, Jose - Team 2: Sarah, Mia

Correct answer
C) Team 1: David, Mia - Team 2: Sarah, Jose

D) Team 1: David - Team 2: Sarah, Jose, Mia

Overall explanation
When deploying team members to the teams, we need to consider balancing the skills and experiences. We can deploy David and Sarah in the same team but since Jose and Mia do not have enough technical skills, this would be a problem. We can deploy Sarah and Mia in the same team, but this time since David and Jose are not experienced in agile environments, then this would be a problem. The perfect fit for this question is deploying David and Mia in the same team and Sarah and Jose in the other team. In team 1, Mia can help David with agile skills and David can help Mia with technical skills. In the other team, Sarah can help Jose with both agile and technical skills.

Question 32
Skipped
It is the onset of the project and the project team is creating the project management plan for a project having an aggressive deadline. The project will be conducted in four phases. For the first three phases, the scope is very certain and the team will be able to develop detailed plans, for this reason, they decided to use a predictive approach for these phases. On the other hand, there are lots of uncertainties and lots of unknowns for the last phase; an agile approach may provide lots of opportunities for this phase. The team members have enough technical skills for this part of the project but only 30% of them are experienced in agile projects.

What should the project manager do?

A) Divide the last phase into two sub-phases; apply a predictive approach for one of these phases and an agile approach for the other one, then decide on roles and responsibilities by considering the agile project experience of the team members

B) Apply a predictive approach for the last phase; working in an agile environment with team members who are not experienced in agile may cause problems in the future

C) Apply an agile approach for the last phase; ask the team members who are experienced in agile projects to teach the agile approach to others until the last phase starts

Correct answer
D) Apply an agile approach for the last phase; schedule virtual training sessions about agile project management

Overall explanation
Since there are lots of uncertainties and unknowns, and since an agile approach may provide lots of opportunities for the last phase, applying an agile approach is more suitable for this phase. Since the project has an aggressive deadline, the team members will be working very hard to deliver the project on time therefore it is not a good idea to ask them to teach agile to others. Scheduling training sessions about agile project management would be a better idea in such a situation.

A) Project Charter

B) Enterprise Environmental Factors

C) Agreements

Correct answer
D) Stakeholder Register

Overall explanation
You need seven things in order to identify stakeholders: Project Charter, Business Documents, Project Management Plan, Project Documents, Agreements, Enterprise Environmental Factors, and Organizational Process Assets.

C) Discuss the options with the key stakeholders, make a decision about the solution, and inform the team about the solution

Correct answer
D) Ensure the team discusses the options, and ask them to make a decision

Overall explanation
Since they have demonstrated a feature during the review meeting, we understand that this is an agile project; therefore, they won’t create any change requests to apply the change. In agile projects, the team makes their decisions by themselves and the project manager serves their needs. Although it is the product owner who makes changes to the product, it is a good idea to discuss the options altogether as a team and make a decision accordingly. Please note that, here, ‘the team’ includes the development team and the product owner besides the project manager.

Question 56
Skipped

Correct answer
B) Address the issues in the product in a collaborative environment with the stakeholders

C) Discuss the issue with the team in the daily meeting tomorrow

D) Ask the development team to discuss the problem about the product and make a decision to solve the issue accordingly by themselves

Overall explanation
Before taking any action, the project manager and the team need to discuss the issue and find the root cause of the problem. Although this is the case, a daily meeting is not a good time to discuss the issues. Besides this, they shouldn’t wait until the end of the iteration for the review meeting, too. As a result, the team needs to discuss the issue (of course, in a collaborative environment) to find the root cause.

Question 59

Question 63
Skipped
In an agile project, there are lots of stakeholders with different expectations. Besides this, since it is going to be a complex project, there will be lots of team members who will work on the project.

In such an environment, which of the following options might be more helpful than other options?

(Choose the best two options)

A) Stakeholder Cube

Correct selection
B) Salience Model

Correct selection
C) Scrum of scrums

Question 64
Skipped
You are the manager responsible for the schedule. Your project manager wants you to prepare the project schedule in 7 days. He also wants you to present this schedule to the executive management just after you complete the schedule. After 7 days, you and your team have prepared the schedule but you don’t have enough time to review the schedule and your estimations. Therefore, you are not sure if the estimates are realistic or not. What should you do in this situation?

A) Tell your project manager that your project schedule is not ready; don’t present it to executive management.

B) Present your estimation to executive management as a rough order of magnitude. Tell them the accuracy range is about +/- 5%.

C) Present the schedule estimation to the executive management; you can make necessary corrections later.

Correct answer
D) Present the schedule to your project manager first and explain the conditions for your estimations.

Overall explanation
Since you haven’t completed the reviewing process, your estimation is a rough order of magnitude (ROM). The accuracy range of a ROM estimation is -25% and +75%. Presenting a ROM estimation as a realistic schedule would not be ethical. In this condition, you should present the schedule estimate to your project manager first and explain the conditions for your estimations. Let him decide whether to postpone the meeting or not.

What should the project manager do about compliance in such an environment?

Correct answer
A) Ask the team to list and categorize the compliance requirements and request them to submit their plan to satisfy compliance

B) Create a list of compliance requirements, categorize them and control each activity in the project to check if they are compliant or not

C) Ask the team to create a list of compliance requirements; then monitor and control their work to see if they satisfy the requirements or not

D) Ask the quality assurance team to create a list of compliance requirements; then submit this list to the client and ask how to satisfy compliance

Overall explanation
It is not expected for the Project Manager to conduct all the Compliance activities by himself; instead, he will be coordinating the team members who are responsible for the various Compliance activities. For this reason, it is a good idea to ask the team to list the compliance requirements and request them to submit their plan to satisfy compliance. Since there are lots of different specifications, it is also a good idea to ask them to categorize these requirements; this way, these requirements can be better managed and controlled.

What should the project manager do?

A) Add an extra contingency reserve for the risk of scope creep

Correct answer
B) Recommend applying an iterative life cycle for the project to define the scope easier

C) Apply fast-tracking technique to make the phases parallel to each other

D) Discuss the issue with the team and work with them to apply an incremental life cycle

Overall explanation
Since the project phases are heavily connected with each other, they need to be very careful when working on the phases; otherwise, this may affect the following phases enormously. As you will remember from the lectures, the Iterative Life Cycle is very helpful if we are caring so much about the correctness of the solution. Therefore, applying an iterative life cycle for this project might be helpful to define the scope easier.

During the last three iterations, the scope has changed enormously; these changes may add two more iterations to the project. The project manager thinks it is still possible to complete the project as it was predicted and believes they need to apply a different approach to do so. This approach requires the team to make lots of improvements to the processes.

What should the project manager do?

A) Create a list of improvement items and discuss them in the review meeting

B) Send a list of improvement items to the team and ask for their feedback in the daily meeting

Correct answer

D) Ask the team to create a list of improvement items and tell the product owner to reprioritize the tasks in the backlog by considering these items

Overall explanation
Since the project manager has an idea to complete the project as it was predicted, he/she needs to discuss the improvement items with the team. Then they will be prioritizing the items to be improved; in other words, they will determine which items are more important than others. (Please note that they will be discussing this during the retrospective meeting, but it is not mentioned in the options.)

Question 75
Skipped

You are not sure about what this answer means, but you think, probably the problem will be solved immediately. But after a few days, you see that the same problem still continues. Which of the following options is not one of the reasons for the problem?

A) Lack of effective listening of the project manager

B) Insufficient feedback message of the project manager

C) Your ineffective feedback message

Correct answer
D) Your ineffective message

Overall explanation
In the question, there is no information about the effectiveness of your message. If you have chosen “Your ineffective feedback message”, you need to reconsider your answer! After the project manager said “OK, thank you”, you should send him a feedback message to tell him that you didn’t understand the answer.

Question 80

What should the project manager have done to prevent the project delay?

A) Updated the schedule baseline regularly to address the project delay

B) Applied fast-tracking and crashing techniques to shorten the project duration

C) Defined contingency reserve that is enough to cover up the delay

Correct answer
D) Used time-boxes to prevent up-front work

Overall explanation
In the question, we understand that they are trying to apply predictive approaches in a very uncertain environment (it says, the scope is changing almost every week!). In such an environment, an agile approach would be more suitable. In other words, they should have been used time-boxed iterations to prevent up-front work and to prevent rework.

Question 84

Question 91
Skipped
Four new projects are about to start within the organization. In the following table, there is basic information about these projects:


The organization determined two execution strategies for these projects. According to the first strategy (Strategy #1), the value will be provided to the customer incrementally; and according to the second strategy (Strategy #2), most of the value will be provided to the customer at the end of the project. 

Which strategies can be applied for which of the projects?

A) Strategy #1: A, C – Strategy #2: B, D

B) Strategy #1: B, D – Strategy #2: A, C

C) Strategy #1: A – Strategy #2: B, C, D

D) Strategy #1: B, C, D – Strategy #2: A

E) Strategy #1: A, D – Strategy #2: B, C

Correct answer
F) Strategy #1: B, C – Strategy #2: A, D

Overall explanation
According to the first strategy, the value will be provided to the customer incrementally; in other words, an agile approach will be used for the projects we will apply Strategy #1. In agile projects, the requirements are not fixed; therefore, Project B and Project C are agile projects and Strategy #1 is more suitable for these projects. On the other hand, since according to the second strategy most of the value will be provided to the customer at the end of the project, a predictive approach will be used for the projects we will apply Strategy #2. The requirements are fixed in predictive projects; thus, Strategy #2 is more suitable for Project A and Project D. Please note that both agile and predictive projects can have co-located or distributed teams; again, the deadline of both agile and predictive projects can be tight or not-tight. Therefore, this information is useless to answer this question.

D) Since the project is finished you don't need to do anything

Overall explanation
As a project manager, you are responsible for documenting lessons learned from the project when you are done with the project. Then you will need to update the related lessons learned database.

Question 95
Skipped
The team is developing a commercial website. The payments page should have been completed in the fifth iteration, but due to an unsolved issue, it couldn’t be completed. The project manager realizes that a similar issue may again cause delays in the future.

What is the best time to discuss this issue so that it won’t happen again in the future?

A) During the first daily meeting

B) Right after the first daily meeting

C) In the review meeting

Correct answer
D) In the retrospective meeting

Overall explanation

Question 96
Skipped
A software project having a very tight deadline is just about to start. Although the organization is located in Country A, there will be a dispersed virtual team working for the project and the team members are located in different countries all around the world. It is clear that there will be cultural differences between team members.

How should the project manager handle the cultural differences between team members?

Correct answer
A) The cultural differences can be learned over time; the project manager needs to be aware that there will be cultural differences, and manage the project accordingly

B) The project manager should meet in-face with all the team members to learn the team members’ cultures, then manage the project by considering cultural differences

C) The project manager should ask all the team members to work by considering Country A’s culture; because the organization is located in Country A

D) The project manager should provide training to make the team learn about other team members’ cultures in depth

Overall explanation
The project manager should manage the project by considering the cultural differences between team members. It takes time to learn the cultural differences and cultural norms; therefore, meeting in-face with team members will not be an effective way to learn the team members’ cultures. Again, providing training to make the team learn about other team members’ cultures would be time-consuming. Cultural differences can be learned over time; the project manager needs to be aware of the cultural differences when managing the project.

Question 100
Skipped
The agile team did a great job in the previous project and now a new project is just about to start. This project will be ‘one of a kind’ for the organization; meaning that, this is going to be the first time the organization will conduct such a project. Some functions of the project require a high-level knowledge of a coding language but only a few of the team members have enough experience in this language.

What should the project manager do to prevent any issues that could be caused because of inexperience?

A) Mentor the inexperienced team members and provide training for these team members

B) Manage the project in a more predictive manner

C) Apply pairing technique in the project

Correct answer
D) Provide training to the team members by considering their experience levels and skills

Overall explanation
Since some of the team members don’t have enough experience in the coding language, providing training will be the best action in such a situation. But please note that not only the inexperienced staff but also the experienced staff may need to be trained. For this reason, the project manager needs to provide training to the team members by considering their experience levels and skills.

Question 101
Skipped

Question 104
Skipped
9th iteration has just been over and the project manager has provided lots of different training sessions to the team members until now. To be able to complete the remaining iterations, the development team needs to know a specific coding language. Based on the training calendar, the training that is specific to this coding language will be provided two weeks later; without this training, it is clear that they can’t go further with the project. Now, the project team thinks about how to solve this issue.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this issue?

A) Checked the training calendar regularly to see if it is aligned with the project schedule or not

Correct answer
B) Ensured the training having higher importance was offered in the earlier stages of the project

C) Assessed the team members’ skills and asked them their training needs

D) Measured the outcomes of the previous training sessions

Overall explanation
If there are lots of training options available, the project manager needs to prioritize these options based on their importance and provide the training having higher importance are offered earlier. Therefore, the project manager should have ensured the training having higher importance was offered in the earlier stages of the project.

Question 105
Skipped
The software project is expected to have 30 iterations. During the 12th iteration, all the steering committee members are changed and the number of members has been decreased. The committee members didn’t give any information about the reason for the change.

What should the project manager do?

Correct answer
A) Tailor the way of communicating with the new committee members

B) Ask the new committee members about the reason for the change; in agile projects, everything should be transparent

C) Hold a meeting with the new steering committee members to introduce the team

D) Send the last progress report to the new steering committee members

Overall explanation
Since the number of steering committee members (ie. the stakeholders) has changed, the project manager needs to tailor the way they communicate with the new committee members, because existing communication ways will not be suitable for the new committee structure.

Overall explanation
Destructive testing loss is an example of the cost of conformance, which is the money spent during the project to avoid failures.
Question 107
Skipped
During the demonstration, the product owner of the contractor approves the increment because they think the increment will satisfy customer needs. On the other hand, the client does not agree with the product owner.

To support their own argument, what should the contractor refer to?

A) The quality documentation

Correct answer
B) The acceptance criteria

C) The product backlog

D) The minimally viable product

Overall explanation
As you will remember from the lectures, the acceptance criteria will be the answer to the “What results will make us understand we achieve our vision?” question. With the help of the acceptance criteria, the stakeholders can clearly understand if the product satisfies the customer's needs or not. If they achieve the acceptance criteria, then this means, the product will satisfy the customer's needs. For this reason, to support their own argument, the contractor should refer to the acceptance criteria. 

Question 108
Skipped
In order to collect requirements, which of the following options cannot be helpful?

A) Expert Judgement

B) Context Diagram

Correct answer
C) Requirements Traceability Matrix

D) Prototypes

Question 109
Skipped
It is the end of the fifth iteration and the project manager received the project’s progress report. The report shows that things are not going well in the project. This is quite surprising because the project manager and the product manager have determined the requirements by considering the project objectives; then these requirements were prioritized to provide value earlier.

What should the project manager have done for a better performance?

A) Calculated the CPI and SPI values earlier and hired team members having better performance

B) Assessed team members’ skills and provided training accordingly

Correct answer
C) Established a self-organized team and encouraged them to contribute to the project

D) Led the team when planning for the iterations

Overall explanation
In the question, it says “the project manager and the product manager have determined the requirements by considering the project objectives”. The project's self-organized team should have contributed to determining the stories of the project (i.e. they should have contributed to the project). This way, they could have determined the requirements better, and the project could have a better performance.

What should the vendor have done to prevent dissatisfaction?

A) Created a detailed project management plan

B) Created the project charter with the vendor

Correct answer
C) Followed a time-boxed approach

D) Asked the client to approve the project management plan

Overall explanation

What should they have done to prevent the conflict?

A) Defined the boundaries for the negotiation

Correct answer
B) Defined the negotiation strategy

C) Defined the success criteria for the negotiation

D) Read the bid documents very carefully

Overall explanation
In the question, it says “the project manager believes they need to negotiate the technical terms first bit the procurement manager insists to talk about the legal terms first”. It is clear that they don’t have any strategy for the negotiation. They should have defined the negotiation strategy before the meeting.

A) It causes inefficient use of the resources

B) It decreases the efficiency of the work

C) It causes a non-productive management effort

Correct answer
D) It causes non-conformance to the requirements

Overall explanation
Excessively decomposition causes inefficient use of the resources and a non-productive management effort. It also decreases the efficiency of the work. Conformance to requirements is about quality and it is not related to work breakdown structure.

B) Talk to the executives and schedule a kick-off meeting

C) Talk to the product owner to start creating the product backlog

D) Celebrate the success with the team

Overall explanation
After the negotiation, the project manager needs to review and verify what they achieved and what they couldn't achieve. Which items have been approved and which items have been rejected? Which goals were achieved, which boundaries were exceeded? Are there any unanswered questions, or are there any items that are not negotiated? The project manager needs to get ready to address the key stakeholders' concerns about the results.

A) Update the product backlog by considering the change

B) Create a change request and wait for its approval

C) Escalate the request to the project manager; only the project manager can make a change on project scope

D) Follow the steps explained in the change management plan

Overall explanation
Only the product owner can change the product backlog. Since the client asks the product owner to make a change, the product owner can update the product backlog by considering the change.

Question 129
Skipped
An organization is having financial issues. During these hard times, they are updating their internal policies to save costs. One of the policy changes is about lunches. Currently, all the team members can go outside for lunch and the company pays for the lunch invoices. But after the policy change, only the project managers and high-level executives will be able to go out for lunch (this is going to be called the ‘exceptions’); other team members will have lunch which is going to be cooked in-house. The project manager just heard about the expected change.

What should the project manager do?

A) Wait for the new policy to get released, then obey the rules

B) Ask the policymakers to add the team leaders to the exceptions list

C) Tell the team members they can still go out for lunch, it is going to be paid from the contingency reserve

Correct answer
D) Ask the policymakers to remove the project managers from the exceptions list

Overall explanation
The project manager is a model for the project team. Since the new policy may harm the team spirit, it might be a good idea for the project manager to ask the policymakers to remove the project managers from the exceptions list.

Question 132
Skipped
You are the budget and cost control manager for a large construction company. Your executives want you to prepare the budget for a new hospital project. The project is new and all information you have is this: "It is going to be almost similar to three other hospital projects in different cities." You decide to use the cost data of these projects to calculate the budget of your project. This is an example of:

Correct answer
A) Parametric Estimating

B) Monte Carlo Simulation

C) Three Point Estimating

D) Analogous Estimating

Overall explanation
Since you use the cost data of other projects and since you make a calculation to obtain the budget, this is a parametric estimating example. You haven’t chosen the “Three Point Estimating” option, have you? In order to say that this is a three-point estimating, you need to use pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic cost estimations to make the calculations. Since such information is not given in the question, “Parametric Estimating” is the best answer.

Question 133
Skipped
What is the present value of $100,000 received 2 years from now?

Assume the interest rate to be 2%.

Correct answer
A) $ 96,116.88

B) $ 96,040

C) $ 69,444.44

D) $ 96,000

Overall explanation
Formula for present value is: PV = FV / (1+r)n . Here, FV is $100,000, r is 0.02 and n is 2. Therefore; PV = 100,000 / (1 + 0.02)2 PV = $96,116.88
Question 134
Skipped
For a function in an application project, the development team needs to know a brand new coding language that is not known by any of the team members. The product backlog has been prioritized so that the development team will have two months to use this language; in other words, they will have enough time to learn this language before using it. The project manager has provided training for the team to learn the coding language.

After two months, they are having problems with developing the function; some team members still don’t have enough knowledge of the coding language. Now there is a risk of being late to deliver this function to the customer.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Updated the risk register

B) Reprioritized the product backlog

C) Updated the impediments board

Correct answer
D) Measured the training outcomes

Overall explanation
After providing the training, the outcomes of the training need to be measured. Then based on the results the project manager may provide additional training so that everyone in the team could have enough knowledge of the coding language.

Question 135
Skipped
You are about to choose the best project to invest in. Which of the following options cannot be a selection criterion?

Correct answer
A) Estimate to complete

B) IRR

C) Net present value

D) Benefit cost ratio

Overall explanation
«Estimate to complete» is not a selection criterion. It is used in earned value calculations and it represents the money needed to complete the remaining work.
Question 136
Skipped
The Net Present Value of Project A is $100,000. IRR and Payback Period are calculated to be 12.5% and 18 months respectively. If the Benefit Cost Ratio is 2.80 and the Interest Rate is 2%, which of the following options is true about this project?

A) The benefits are smaller than the costs

B) Profit is 2.80 times the cost

Correct answer
C) Revenue is 2.80 times the cost

D) Costs are 2.80 times the profit

Overall explanation
If we look at the options, we see that all of them are related to profit, revenue, and cost. We can answer the question by only thinking about the benefit-cost ratio value. All other data in the question are unnecessary. The benefit-cost ratio is the benefit (or revenue; not the profit!) divided by cost. Since it is 2.80, the revenue is 2.80 times the cost.

Question 137
Skipped
The dispersed agile team consists of team members living in seven different countries. They are using video conferencing tools to communicate with each other. One of the key team members living in Country A is complaining about the connection speed and sometimes, he cannot be able to attend the meetings because of the unstable connection.

What should the project manager do?

A) Inform the team member with email about what has been discussed in the meeting, after the meeting

Correct answer
B) Discuss the options about virtual communication with the team member

C) Tell the team member to work in the head office

D) Ask the team member to find a different internet provider providing better connection speed and working more stable

Overall explanation
Before taking any action, the project manager needs to know their options first. Discussing the options about virtual communication with the team member is the best action in such a situation.

Question 138
Skipped
Performance calculations for a project have been completed. The cost variance of the project is calculated to be $225,000. Which of the following options may not be true about this project?

A) The project is under the budget

B) CPI is greater than 1

C) AC is smaller than EV

Correct answer
D) PV is smaller than EV

Overall explanation
Let’s remember the formula for Cost Variance: CV=EV-AC. Since CV is greater than 0, AC should be smaller than EV.  CPI = EV / AC. Since AC is smaller than EV, CPI is greater than 1.  We know, if the CPI is greater than 1, then the project is under budget.  We can’t make any comments about PV because we don’t have any information about it.

Question 139
Skipped
Which of the following projects has the best schedule performance compared to others?

A) Project A: CPI = 0.80 and SPI = 0.90

B) Project B: CPI = 1.05 and SPI = 1.15

Correct answer
C) Project C: CPI = 0.75 and SPI = 1.20

D) Project D: CPI = 1.20 and SPI = 0.85

Overall explanation
Since we are looking for the best schedule performance, we should compare the SPI values. Please note: Greater SPI means better schedule performance. Project C has the greatest SPI; therefore, its schedule performance is better than others.

Question 140
Skipped
There are two ongoing IT projects. Alex, the senior planner, has calculated the following indexes for these projects:

Project A: CPI=1.05 TCPI=0.95

Project B: CPI=1.05 TCPI=0.80

By only considering these indexes, which of the following options is true about these projects?

A) Both projects are over the budget

B) AC is greater than EV for Project A

Correct answer
C) Project A’s probability of completion within the budget is smaller than Project B

D) Project B’s probability of completion within the budget is smaller than Project A

Overall explanation
Since CPI is greater than 1 for both projects, both projects are under the budget.  CPI=EV/AC; since CPI is greater than 1 for project A, AC is smaller than EV.  Please remember: Higher TCPI means a smaller probability of completion within the budget. Since the TCPI of project A is higher than the TCPI of project B, then Project A’s probability of completion within the budget is smaller than Project B's.

Question 141
Skipped
An agile project is about to start and the project team members are about to get hired.

Which of the following teams has the ideal team member distribution?

(Choose two)




A) A

B) B

Question 142
Skipped
In a project having a highly uncertain environment, the root cause of a critical issue needs to be investigated.

Classify the following actions of the project manager as ‘good’ and ‘could be better' by considering the environment.

I – Send out an email to the team members describing how they should investigate the issue further

II – Schedule a meeting and ensure the team members provide inputs to find the root cause

III – Talk to the team members face-to-face to explain how they should find the root cause of the issue

IV – Ask the team leaders if they need anything to solve the issue easier

A) Good: I & II; Could be better: III & IV

B) Good: I & III; Could be better: II & IV

C) Good: I & IV; Could be better: II & III

D) Good: II & III; Could be better: I & IV

Correct answer
E) Good: II & IV; Could be better: I & III

F) Good: III & IV; Could be better: I & II

Overall explanation
Since it is a highly uncertain environment, an agile approach would be suitable for this project. In agile projects, the project manager acts as a servant leader; therefore, we will be classifying the project manager’s action as ‘good’ if it is an action expected from a servant leader. A typical servant leader does not tell the team members what they ‘should’ do; therefore, I and III cannot be classified as ‘good’. II and IV are the actions a servant leader can do.

You are the project manager of a software development project. You are about to estimate the duration of each activity. The engineer who is responsible for Activity A has not been hired yet. You know from your experiences that this activity will most probably take 12 days to complete. In one of the projects that you had worked on before, it took 18 days for a similar activity to complete. But you know that this was an exceptional case. One of your team members says that if everything goes perfectly ok, this activity may be completed in 8 days. What is your duration estimate for this activity?

A) 12.67 days

Correct answer
B) 12.33 days

C) 15.33 days

D) 10.33 days

Overall explanation
P=18 days; M=12 days; O=8 days Expected Activity Duration = (P + 4*M + O) / 6 = (18 + (4*12) + 8) / 6 = 12.33
Question 144
Skipped
In a project, there will be three different functions and three different teams will work on these functions. The information about the functions and the team members who will work on these functions is as it is given in the following table:


The project manager is determining the management strategy she will apply; she will apply different management styles for different teams. Which strategy is more suitable for which teams?

Correct answer
A) Team A: Servant – Team B: Directive – Team C: Servant

B) Team A: Servant – Team B: Servant – Team C: Servant

C) Team A: Directive – Team B: Directive – Team C: Servant

D) Team A: Servant – Team B: Directive – Team C: Directive

E) Team A: Directive – Team B: Directive – Team C: Directive

Overall explanation
The complexity of the functions, the certainty levels, and the documentation needs are indicating that all the functions will have an agile environment. In an agile environment, a prototype can or cannot be produced; it doesn’t tell us anything about our management style. We know that the servant leadership style is the leadership style we should prefer in agile environments. But if there are lots of inexperienced members in the team, the servant style may cause issues, because to be able to apply the servant style, the team members need to be experienced. We see that all of the members in Team B are inexperienced; for this reason, a directive style will be more suitable for this team.

Question 145
Skipped
You have created the work breakdown structure and developed the WBS dictionary. Now you are about to decompose the work packages. These decomposed work packages are called:

A) Decompositions

Correct answer
B) Activities

C) Milestones

D) Work packages

Overall explanation
To determine the activities, you need to decompose the work packages. Therefore, these decomposed work packages are called activities.
Question 146
Skipped
You have defined the project risks and developed the probability and impact matrix. The risk response actions are also planned. Now you are about to determine the risk owners for these risks. Which of the following documents can help you better to determine the risk owners?

A) Stakeholder register

Correct answer
B) Risk register

C) Staff release plan

D) RACI chart

Overall explanation
The risk owners are documented in the risk register. Therefore, the risk register is the right document to determine the risk owners.

Question 147
Skipped
The project manager needs to give feedback to the team members about their performance regularly; this is important for improving the team performance. In a project, the team is performing very well except for one of the team members. Which of the following options is the best time to give feedback to the team member who is not performing well?

A) Daily scrum meetings

B) Retrospective meetings

C) Demonstrations

Correct answer
D) One-by-one discussions

Overall explanation
In retrospective meetings, the team talks about what they did right and what they did wrong; therefore, a retrospective is a good opportunity to discuss the performance of the team as a whole and to give feedback. But in this question, it is talking about giving feedback to a single team member. If the team member is not performing well and if the project manager would like to give feedback about his/her performance, to not to make the team member feel bad in front of his/her peers, it might be a good idea to give feedback in a one-by-one discussion.

Question 148
Skipped
In an agile environment, the project manager provides training and offers feedback to the team members regularly.

Which of the following tools can be helpful for the project manager to verify performance improvements within the team?

(Choose two)

A) Pairing

Correct selection
B) Gap Analysis

C) Product Box Exercise

D) DISC Model

Correct selection
E) Post-training assessments

Overall explanation
Gap analysis and post-training assessments can be helpful for the project manager to verify performance improvements within the team during the project.

Question 149
Skipped
You are about to develop the risk response strategies for your project. To increase the probability of a positive risk event, you should:

A) Accept the risk

Correct answer
B) Enhance the risk

C) Transfer the risk

D) Mitigate the risk

Overall explanation
Enhancing is the best strategy to increase the probability of a positive risk event. Enhancing the risk can increase the positive effect of the risk event.

Question 150
Skipped
You are working on a chart indicating the number of days the software engineer will be working over the weeks of the project. Most probably, this is a:

A) Staff Acquisition Chart

Correct answer
B) Resource Histogram

C) Monte Carlo Simulation

D) Tornado Diagram

Overall explanation
Most probably, this is a Resource Histogram. In a resource histogram, you can find the representation of the time the resource will work on the project.

Question 151
Skipped
To develop the project management plan, you are searching for organizational process assets. Which of the following options will not be helpful in this situation?

A) Project closure guidelines

B) Proposal evaluation criteria

C) Performance measurement criteria

Correct answer
D) Business case for the project

Overall explanation
While developing the project charter, you can use the business case of the project. The business case would not help you with project management plan development. All other options are used to develop the project management plan process.

Question 152
Skipped
You just got an email about the EVM results of the project. You see that the CPI is 0.75; last month, it was 1.00! As the project manager, you decide to hold a meeting to talk about this issue; therefore, you will send a meeting request by e-mail. This is an example of:

A) Pull communication

B) Push communication

Correct answer
C) Interactive communication

D) Control communication

Overall explanation
You decided to hold a meeting to talk about the issue. Meeting is neither a pull nor a push communication. It is interactive communication.

Question 153
Skipped
In an agile project, two team members are having a conflict about an issue. The project manager is analyzing the context.

Which of the following actions of the project manager is not a realistic action to solve the problem?

A) Talk to both parties to find a way in which both parties can win

B) Ask both team members to calm down right now; schedule a meeting to discuss the issue later

C) Explain to both team members why they need to compromise

Correct answer
D) Determine who is right and who is wrong; ask the member who is wrong to accept what other member says, or leave the team

Overall explanation
Asking a team member to leave the team because of a conflict is not a realistic action to solve the problem.

Question 154
Skipped
In an agile environment, the project manager is determining the strategy for mentoring key stakeholders. Which of the following strategies is better than other strategies?

(Choose two)

Correct selection
A) First, schedule a meeting with the key stakeholders together to talk about the project objectives and expectations; then talk to the team members face-to-face individually to mentor them

B) First, schedule a meeting with the key stakeholders together and discuss the objectives of the project; then tell them whenever they need help, they can come to you anytime

Correct selection
C) First, meet the key stakeholders individually to talk about their expectations and objectives about the project and provide mentoring; then hold a meeting with everyone to discuss the objectives of the project and talk about the roles and responsibilities of the teams

D) Attach an announcement to the Information Radiator about why the team leaders should mentor their teams; write your personal email address below the announcement so that they can ask you questions anytime

Overall explanation
Scheduling a meeting with the key stakeholders and talking to them one-by-one is an excellent strategy for mentoring. The order is not that important; he/she can hold a meeting together and then talk to them one-by-one or he/she can talk to them one-by-one and then hold a meeting with everyone. Please note that it might be scary for some people to come to the project manager to ask questions. For this reason, A and C are better than option B.

Question 155
Skipped
You have the following information about an IT project:

CPI=1.15; SPI=1.05 and BAC=$1,200,000

Calculate the estimate at completion.

Correct answer
A) $ 1,043,478.26

B) $ 1,142,857.14

C) $ 1,200,000

D) $ 1,105,243.24

Overall explanation
We will use this formula: EAC = BAC / CPI EAC = 1,200,000$ / 1,15 EAC = $1,043,478.26
Question 156
Skipped
You are planning to give a work package for your project. The scope is clear, therefore, it is going to be a fixed price contract. You are in a meeting with a prospective subcontractor. During this meeting, you won't negotiate the:

A) Details about the scope of the project

B) The time required to complete the total work

C) Payment schedule

Correct answer
D) The total cost of the subcontractor

Overall explanation
Since it is going to be a fixed price contract, you don’t need to know the total cost of the subcontractor. Therefore, you will not negotiate the total cost of the subcontractor.
Question 157
Skipped
In an agile project, Marko started using a different function when writing the code for the application. This function provided an increased speed for the project. Although this is the case, this function caused minor issues in other parts of the project.

What should the project manager do to give positive and negative feedback to Marko?

A) Give both positive and negative feedback in the daily meeting tomorrow

B) Give both positive and negative feedback in the first retrospective meeting

C) Give positive feedback in the retrospective meeting and give negative feedback in a one-by-one meeting with him

Correct answer
D) Give both positive and negative feedback in a one-by-one meeting with him

Overall explanation
Giving negative feedback in front of everyone can make the team member feel bad; therefore, providing negative feedback in the daily meeting and the retrospective meeting is not a good idea in this situation. Giving positive feedback but not giving negative feedback in the retrospective meeting might be disturbing for other team members; therefore, it is better to give both positive and negative feedback in a one-by-one meeting with the team member.

Question 158
Skipped
A friend of yours, Alex, is the project manager of a large project. He says "We just signed a contract with the seller. This contract type is the riskiest one for our company." Most probably, this is a:

A) Fixed Price Contract

B) Time and Material Contract

C) Cost Plus Award Fee Contract

Correct answer
D) Cost Plus Fee Contract

Overall explanation
Among the options, Cost Plus Fee Contract is the riskiest contract type for the buyer.

Question 159
Skipped
The following information is known about a fixed price incentive fee contract:

Ceiling price: $750,000

Target Cost: $600,000

Target Fee: $70,000

If the total cost is $1,000,000, what is the final price?

A) $712,245.24

B) $690,000

Correct answer
C) $750,000

D) More information is needed to answer the question

Overall explanation
The actual cost is $1,000,000 and it is greater than the ceiling price ($750,000). Since the seller cannot get any payment above the ceiling price, the ceiling price will be the final price.

Question 160
Skipped
You are an experienced project manager. You know that poor quality causes negative effects. Which of the following options is not an effect of poor quality?

A) Rework

B) Increased costs

Correct answer
C) Decreased risk

D) Decreased profits

Overall explanation
Poor quality does not decrease the risk; it increases the risk.

Question 161
Skipped
In an agile project, there is an issue with a function used in the code. The issue was caused because of a mistake of a team member. The issue may cause a project delay, so the project manager decided to explain the situation to the higher management.

The project manager explained to the executive everything with numerical values, but the executive said “Don’t come to me with these meaningless numbers! Just tell me if we can solve the issue or not!”

What should the project manager have done to prevent the executive’s ‘unexpected’ reaction?

A) Used the DISC Model to determine the executive’s personality type and then explained the issue by considering the executive’s personality type

Correct answer
B) Explained the issue by considering the personality type of the executive with the help of the Social Style Model

C) Talked to the team member about the issue and learned more about the issue before talking to the executive

D) Checked the correctness of the numerical values a few times before talking to the executive

Overall explanation
Some personality types are not open to numbers and numerical expressions. In the question, we see that the project manager tries to explain the issue with numerical values but the executive finds these numbers ‘meaningless’. Therefore, the project manager should have considered the personality type of the executive when explaining the issue. Please note that, in the DISC Model, we ask the individuals to answer a test, and based on the results we can determine their personality types. In the situation explained in the question, the project manager will not be able to ask the executive to answer a test, for this reason, the Social Style Model is more suitable, because by using this technique, the project manager can understand the personality of the executive by observing his/her behavior.

Question 162
Skipped
* You hired new team members during the formation of the final agile project team. Two of these team members are from Germany, one is from Japan, and the others are from Belgium. They will attend the online meetings regularly but they will spend only a portion of their time on the project. How do you classify this team?

A) Dedicated, Co-located

B) Part-time, Co-located

C) Virtual, Co-located

Correct answer
D) Part-time, Virtual

Overall explanation
Since they spend only a portion of their time working on the project, they are working part-time. Since they live in different countries and they attend online meetings, this is a virtual team.

Question 163
Skipped
* You hired all of the members of the agile project team. In the beginning, there were some disagreements between members. But nowadays they start to build good working relationships. According to the Tuckman ladder model, which stage of team formation and development is this?

A) Doing

B) Forming

Correct answer
C) Norming

D) Performing

Overall explanation
The Tuckman ladder model identifies these stages: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning. Since the team members begin to build good working relationships, this is the “Norming” stage.

Question 164
Skipped
We can classify the powers of project managers in various ways. Which of the following options is not a power derived from the position of the project manager?

A) Legitimate

Correct answer
B) Referent

C) Reward

Overall explanation
Legitimate (formal), reward, and penalty are the powers derived from the position of the project manager.

Question 165
Skipped
Fill in the blank: In agile projects, the team …………………………. to determine the Minimum Viable Product.

(Choose two)

Correct selection
A) may need to subdivide the stories

B) holds retrospective meetings

C) plans the next iteration

Correct selection
D) needs to consider the business value

Overall explanation
In agile projects, the team needs to consider the business value to determine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). They may also need to subdivide the stories when determining the MVP.

Question 166
Skipped
You are about to attend a meeting to make the last negotiation with a prospective seller. Which of the following options should be one of your goals during this meeting?

A) You should win the negotiation by making the seller accept all your terms and conditions

B) You must accept all of the seller's requests

Correct answer
C) You should develop a good relationship with the prospective seller

D) You should establish ground rules to resolve the conflicts

Overall explanation
The negotiation preferably should not be done in a win-lose environment. Accepting all of the seller's requests is not acceptable. You should develop a good relationship with the prospective seller to complete the work successfully and this should be one of your goals.

Question 167
Skipped
In a project, the project team will produce three features. It is the end of the 10th week and the team has a Backlog Burnup Chart like this:


Which of the following statements cannot be said about this project?

(Choose two)

A) New requirements are added to the backlog in the 3rd iteration

B) It takes 3 iterations to complete Feature 3

C) Each iteration has a 2-week time-boxed duration

D) There might be problems with developing Feature 1

Correct selection
E) It has been planned to complete the project after 5 iterations

Correct selection
F) The project is behind the schedule

Overall explanation
We see that in the 3rd iteration, the number of stories is increased from 48 to 53; therefore, new stories (ie. new requirements) are added to the backlog in the 3rd iteration. The team started working on Feature 3 in the 3rd iteration and they completed this feature at the end of the 5th iteration; in other words, it takes 3 iterations to complete Feature 3. Since this is the end of the 10th week, and since 5 iterations have been completed during this duration, each iteration has a 2-week time-boxed duration. We see that they started working on Feature 1 in the first iteration, then they didn’t have any progress; they made a progress in the 3rd iteration but then, again, they didn’t have any progress. So, there might be problems with developing Feature 1. On the chart, we don’t have any information about what has been planned; therefore, we don’t know when (ie. after how many iterations) we plan to complete the project. Again, since we don’t have any information about what we have planned, we don’t have any information about if the project is behind the schedule or not.

Question 168
Skipped
It is the end of the 42nd day of an agile project and the project team will make EVM calculations based on the following chart:


What is the CPI?

Correct answer
A) 0.80

B) 0.67

C) 0.83

D) 0.90

Overall explanation
Let’s remember the CPI formula: CPI = EV / AC. On the chart, we see that the Earned Value (EV) is $80,000 and the Actual Cost (AC) is $100,000. (If you have problems with how we found these values, please revisit the ‘EVM in Agile Environments’ lecture.) Therefore, CPI = $80,000 / $100,000 = 0.80.

Question 169
Skipped
Once the closure has been completed and the buyer has formally approved the seller’s products;

A) The project is closed for the buyer

Correct answer
B) The project is closed for the seller

C) Procurement is closed only for the seller

D) Procurement is closed only for the buyer

Overall explanation
This is a tricky question. Buyer’s procurement is the seller’s project. Therefore, once the closure has been completed and the buyer has formally approved the seller’s products; then the project is closed for the seller. But since the procurement is closed, it is closed for both the buyer and the seller.

Question 170
Skipped
The project team which comprises six team members is determining the story points of the stories by using the Planning Poker technique. They laid down their cards, and they got the following estimations for the first story: 8, 8, 13, 8, 5, 13.

What is the story point estimation for this story?

A) 5

B) 8

Correct answer
C) 13

D) 9

Overall explanation
As you will remember from the lectures, in the Planning Poker technique, the team members receive a set of these Planning Poker cards. After that, the Team Facilitator reads a User Story, and to understand the Story, they discuss it briefly. After the discussion, everyone makes an estimation about this Story but no one talks about his or her estimation yet. Then everyone lays down their cards at the same time. If the estimations are close to each other, the largest estimate will be the Story Point estimation for this Story. Since the estimations in the question are close to each other, the largest estimate (i.e. 13) will be the Story Point estimation for the first story.

Question 171
Skipped
The standard deviation of activity A is 1.5 days. Duration estimates of Activity B are:

Most likely: 20 days

Pessimistic: 28 days

Optimistic: 17 days.

You know that Activity C is between 26 and 30 days. Which of the following options is wrong?

A) The standard deviation of Activity B is 1.83

Correct answer
B) The standard deviation of Activity C is 0.67

C) Activity C is the riskiest activity

D) Expected activity duration of Activity B is 20.83 days

Overall explanation
“You know that Activity C is between 26 and 30 days. ” Therefore, the range of Activity C is between 26 and 30 days. Since the range is between EAD – SD and EAD + SD; EAD – SD = 26 days and; EAD + SD = 30 days; Subtract 26 from 30 and divide by 2  to get SD: (30 – 26)/2 = 2 days. (not 0.67! All other statements are true.)  Here are the detailed calculations: EAD – SD = 26 days, add SD to both sides; EAD – SD + SD = 26 days + SD EAD = 26 days + SD; put EAD in 2nd equation; (26 days + SD) + SD = 30 days 26 days + 2xSD = 30days; subtract 26 from both sides; 26 days + 2xSD – 26 days = 30 days – 26 days 2xSD = 4 days; divide both sides by 2; (2xSD) / 2 = 4 / 2 SD = 4 / 2 = 2 days

Question 172
Skipped

According to the given network diagram and the activity durations, which of the following options is wrong?

A) Total Float of activity A is 0

B) Total Float of activity Z is 0

C) Free Floats of activities on the critical path are all 0

Correct answer
D) None of the above

Overall explanation
Don’t try to calculate anything, you are not a computer! Activity A is the Start activity and Activity Z is the Finish activity. The total floats of Start and Finish activities are always equal to zero. Free floats of all activities on the critical path are always equal to zero, too. Therefore A, B, and C are true. None of the options are wrong.

Question 173
Skipped
You have completed the performance calculations for your project. You have calculated the TCPI as 0.90. Which of the following options may not be true about this project?

A) The project is under the budget

B) CPI is greater than 1

C) EV is greater than AC

Correct answer
D) SPI is smaller than 1

Overall explanation
TCPI, to complete performance index, is the future CPI we should have if we want to complete the project at the original budgeted amount. TCPI equals 0.90, therefore, it is less than 1. This means our cost performance is good. In other words, our project is under budget, and CPI should be greater than 1. The formula for CPI: CPI =  EV / AC. Since CPI is greater than 1, EV (Earned Value) is greater than AC (Actual Cost). Options A, B, and C are true then. The schedule performance index is an indicator of how we are doing with our schedule. Since we don’t have any information about schedule performance, we cannot make any comments about the value of SPI.

Question 174
Skipped
The Cumulative Flow Diagram of a software development project is given as follows:


Based on the given Cumulative Flow Diagram, which of the following expressions is correct?

A) The response time is very high in this project

Correct answer
B) In the project, there is a risk of low quality because of the bottleneck

C) The extreme amount of idle time in the project delivery needs to be fixed

D) The average throughput is extremely high for this project

Overall explanation
On the Cumulative Flow Diagram, we see that the number of total features which are in progress is very high; in other words, the cycle time is very high. Increased Cycle Time may point to a bottleneck which may lead to quality defects (and delays). Therefore, in this project, there is a risk of low quality because of the bottleneck. Since the number of features in the ‘To Do’ list is low, the response time is also low. We don’t have any information about the idle time on the Cumulative Flow Diagram, therefore, we can’t make any comment on the idle time. As you will remember from the lecture we talked about the Little’s Law, if the Cycle Time is high, then the throughput should be low; in other words, the average throughput is not extremely high for this project.

Question 175

Your company is doing the fence works of a project. Total fence work is 2,000 meters. According to the contract, you should complete the work in 120 days. It is a fixed price contract having a contract price of $50,000. It is the 50th day of the project. $25,000 has been spent to complete 500 meters of fencing work. Calculate the cost performance index.

Correct answer
A) 0.50

B) 0.42

C) 2.00

D) 0.60

Overall explanation
According to contract, 1 meter of fence work should cost us: 50,000$ / 2,000m = 25 $/m. Up to now, we should spend: 500 m x 25 $/m = 12,500$; this is our Earned Value. Since we have spent 25,000$ until now, AC=25,000$. CPI = EV / AC CPI = 12,500$ / 25,000$ CPI = 0.50

Which contract type is suitable for this work package?

A) Cost Plus Incentive Fee

B) Fixed Price Award Fee

C) Time and Material

Correct answer
D) Graduated Fixed Price

Overall explanation
Since the scope is highly uncertain an agile contract should be used for this work package. By signing a Graduated Fixed Price contract, both parties will be sharing the risk and reward.

Question 178
Skipped
When executing an agile project, the project manager wants to ensure the stakeholders are informed about the progress of the benefits.

What tool (or document) can the project manager use to identify which stakeholders need to be informed about the progress of the benefits?

A) Resource Management Plan

Question 180
Skipped
This is going to be a very challenging year for the organization because they will start applying agile approaches for the first time and lots of changes will be made in the organization for this purpose. Some people in the organization are not comfortable with the agile terms and this caused resistance against the agile practices. Besides this, some executives believe the agile methodologies are not suitable for this organization; for this reason, they are not willing to support agile practices within the organization.

In this environment, a brand new project is just about to start. What should the project manager do to prevent problems in the project?

(Choose two)

Correct selection
A) Tailor the agile terms so that they can be easily understood by everyone

B) Use scrum of scrums technique to manage the teams easier

C) Encourage people to take their own decisions

Correct selection
D) Use emotional intelligence and leadership skills to gain executive buy-in

E) Ask the team members to create their own cross-functional teams

Overall explanation
All the actions described in the options can be useful when transiting from a predictive environment to an agile environment. But the question mentions only two issues. First, some people are not comfortable with the agile terms, and second, some executives are not willing to support agile practices within the organization. By tailoring the agile terms, the resistance against the agile practices can be decreased, and by using emotional intelligence and leadership skills, executive buy-in can be gained.

##PRACTICE TEST 1
=============================================



Question 1
Skipped
Your company, Best Construction, is a middle-sized construction company. You have recently completed a project and this year another project is planned to start. Your company always gives priority to the best profitable projects. There are 3 project alternatives, and you should select one of these projects.



From the given data which project should be selected?



A) Since it is a middle-sized company such an analysis is unnecessary.

B) Project A should be selected since it has the lowest Payback Period

Correct answer
C) Project B should be selected since it has the highest NPV and benefit-cost ratio

D) Project C should be selected. Since Project B is far away from the city center, it is the worst project. Since all data given for Project C are better than Project A, Project C is the best project.

Overall explanation
In the question, it says “Your company always gives priority to best profitable projects.” Therefore the most profitable project should be selected. The payback period or the notes column does not give any idea about the profitability of the project. From the given data, NPV and Benefit-Cost Ratio should be considered. Remember “Higher the NPV, better the project” and also “Higher the benefit-cost ratio, better the project”. Project B is the best project.

Question 2
Skipped
You are the project manager of a piping project. You just heard a conversation between a welder and the construction manager. Welder says: «My location is the 250th meter of the pipeline project and I have to weld two pipes according to schedule. But I see that there is an electrician working at this location. We cannot work together at the same time because there is no enough space for us to work together. I talked to the electrician guy and he says he needs 3 more hours to complete his job. Only after that, I will be able to start to work here.» According to the schedule, both welder and electrician should work there today, but since the schedule is on a daily basis, it doesn’t tell you who should work first. Which of the following statements best describes the problem?

A) Business Documents are improperly prepared

B) Authority level of workers is not determined properly

Correct answer
C) Work authorization system does not exist

D) The project control system does not set

Overall explanation
Since the schedule is prepared on a daily basis, in order to avoid these kinds of conflicts, there should be a work authorization system for hourly works to be done on the same day. Lack of the work authorization system may be the main reason for the problem.

You are doing earned value calculations for your project. You do the calculations for each activity. For some activities you found SPI to be zero. Which of the following statements is true?

A) You don’t need to take any corrective action since your project is ahead of schedule

B) You need to take corrective action since your project is behind the schedule

Correct answer
C) Activities having zero SPI have not earned any value

D) “SPI equals to zero” does not tell us any information about the project

Overall explanation
Let’s remember the formula for SPI. SPI = EV / PV. If SPI equals zero, then EV should be zero. Since EV equals zero, there is no earned value. In the question, it says SPI has found to be zero for some of the activities. Since we don’t have any information about if these activities are on the critical path or not, we cannot say the total project is behind the schedule for sure. These activities are behind the schedule, but the project may or may not be behind the schedule.

Question 4
Skipped
The standard deviation of Activity A is 5; the standard deviation of Activity B is 4; the standard deviation of Activity C is 7 and the standard deviation of Activity D is 6. Which activity is the least risky activity?

A) Activity A

Correct answer
B) Activity B

C) Activity C

D) Activity D

Overall explanation
Just remember: Lower standard deviation means lower risk.
Question 5
Skipped
During the project, a project manager realizes that to conduct an activity, the team needs to know a piece of software. Since the project manager realizes this issue just before starting the activity, this will cause a delay because providing training about this software will take more than a week.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this delay?

A) Checked the risk register and updated the risks to address the risk

Correct answer
B) Checked the skills list and provided training by considering the project schedule

C) Entered the issue into the issue log

D) Created a change request about the issue

Overall explanation
The project manager should have checked the skills list and provided training earlier by considering the project schedule. The risk register, issue log, or change request will not be helpful to prevent this issue.

Question 6
Skipped
Coders in the project prefer to communicate by chatting with each other by using instant messaging tools and emailing code snippets to each other. Although this communication method provides them to communicate with each other fast, other team members are complaining about not getting enough information about the project progress.

Choose two of the following options that can be helpful to provide better communication in such an environment.

A) Schedule baseline

B) Work breakdown structure

Correct selection
C) Information radiator

D) Active listening

Correct selection
E) Kanban

F) Face-to-face meetings

Overall explanation
Here, the problem is the coders are communicating with each other but other team members do not get enough information about this communication. Therefore, we need to find the tools that might be helpful for providing better knowledge transfer to other team members in the project. Kanban and information radiator can be helpful for such a purpose.

Question 7
Skipped
In the project, there are stakeholders like the project team, advisors, marketing team, and subcontractors. These stakeholders are arguing with each other all the time and complaining about things. Because of this non-respectful environment, the project may not achieve success in the end.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Determined the set of ground rules, then outlined these rules to everyone and asked for everyone to obey these rules

B) Determined the ground rules with the project team, then presented the key stakeholders with these ground rules

C) Determined the ground rules with the project team, presented the key stakeholders with these ground rules, and asked everyone to obey the rules

Correct answer
D) Determined the ground rules in a meeting with the stakeholders together

Overall explanation
The ground rules are for everyone, and everyone (not only the project team!) should work together when determining the Ground Rules. Therefore, the best answer is D.

Question 8
Skipped
Which of the following options is not a profit from the project charter?

Correct answer
A) Business Documents are created

B) The project manager is authorized for spending money

C) Success criteria for the project are identified

D) High-level risks are identified

Overall explanation
Business Documents are needed to develop the project charter; it is not a profit from the project charter.

Question 9
Skipped
For a software project, the time required for the invested money to be repaid equals 1.75 years. The net present value is calculated to be $250,000. If the revenue is 1.50 times the costs, what is the benefit-cost ratio?

A) 1.75

B) 1.17

Correct answer
C) 1.50

D) 0.86

Overall explanation
The revenue is 1.50 times the costs, this means the benefit-cost ratio is 1.50. All other data is unnecessary to answer the question.

Question 10
Skipped
Three of the team members were hired from a subcontractor of a different project. Although this subcontractor is an Italian company and these team members are Italian, they have an advanced level of English. But other team members are complaining because they always talk Italian to each other.

What should the project manager do?

A) Enter the issue into the issue log

B) Hire new members to the team, and employ the Italian members to another project in Italy

C) Provide Italian language training to other team members to enhance the cultural diversity

Correct answer
D) Ask these three members if there are any obstacles causing them not to speak English

Overall explanation
The Project Manager needs to provide an environment in which people can work together in an effective and efficient manner. To provide such an environment, it is better to ask these three team members if there are any obstacles causing them not to speak English. Please note that there is nothing wrong with speaking their own language inside the team. The project manager’s aim is to determine if there are any obstacles in this case.

Question 11
Skipped
One of the team members used to be a high-performing team member but the project manager realizes that there is a significant decrease in his performance. This performance decrease may cause a project delay. The project manager talks about this issue with this team member and the team member says that there are lots of new items that he doesn’t know anything about; he says he tries to train himself but it takes time to learn about new items.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Updated the stakeholder register and determined the stakeholder requirements

B) Requested earlier feedback from other team members about this team member’s performance

Correct answer
C) Conducted gap analysis to determine the skill gaps of the team members and provided training to close the gaps

D) Created a change request and updated the risk register about the project delay risk accordingly

Overall explanation
The project manager should know the skill gaps in the team. By conducting a gap analysis, he/she can determine the skill gaps of the team members. Then by considering these gaps, he/she can provide training to close the skill gaps.

Question 12
Skipped
The vision of the project is clearly defined, the ground rules are determined and the project charter is signed by the sponsor right after the kick-off meeting. During the project work, new team members and new stakeholders are attending to the project. The project manager would like to share the vision and the ground rules with the new stakeholders. Here are the project manager’s options:

I – Asking for a volunteer within the team to inform new stakeholders about the project vision and the ground rules

II – Sharing a document with each new team member including the information about the project vision and ground rules

III –Delegating the team leaders responsible for integrating their new members and asking these leaders to inform the new members about the project vision and the ground rules

Analyze these options by considering the effectiveness of each option.

Correct answer
A) Most effective: I - Less effective: III - Least effective: II

B) Most effective: I - Less effective: II - Least effective: III

C) Most effective: II - Less effective: III - Least effective: I

D) Most effective: II - Less effective: I - Least effective: III

E) Most effective: III - Less effective: II - Least effective: I

F) Most effective: III - Less effective: I - Least effective: II

Overall explanation
In the question, it says “the project charter is signed by the sponsor right after the kick-off meeting”; therefore, this is an Agile environment. To answer this question, you need to consider the following first: “In Agile environments, the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within the team is face-to-face conversation”. Then, you also need to be careful about the words ‘stakeholder’ and ‘team members’. Option II is about sharing a document and it is not a face-to-face conversation; therefore this is the least effective option. Option III involves only the new team members (it doesn’t involve other stakeholders), for this reason, it is effective but not the most effective one. Option I explains a face-to-face conversation with every stakeholder and for this reason, this is the most effective one.

Question 13
Skipped
Which of the following options is the best way to deal with problems?

A) Recommend corrective actions

B) Defect repair

C) Measure the project performance

Correct answer
D) Preventive actions

Overall explanation
All of the options except “Measuring the project performance” are done while dealing with problems. But since the question is asking for the best way, preventive actions will be the best answer, because preventing a problem is always better than taking (or recommending) corrective actions and defect repair.

Question 14
Skipped
The ground rules are defined and shared with the stakeholders. Now the project manager needs to ensure they are being obeyed.

What should the project manager do to effectively manage the ground rules?

A) Punish the violations, award the compliance

Correct answer
B) Obey the rules and rectify if anyone does not obey them

C) Add information about how to communicate violations in the communications management plan

D) Ask team leaders to become responsible for effective application of the ground rules within the team

Overall explanation
The project manager's role does not end after sharing the Ground Rules with everyone. He/she also needs to ensure they are applied too. He/she needs to obey these rules, and this is the best way of ensuring the application of these rules. He/she not only needs to obey these rules but also rectify if anyone (including himself/herself) does not obey them.

Question 15
Skipped
The XYZ Company uses KPIs to measure team members’ performances. Based on the results, high performer project team members are given a holiday to a city as a gift. It is the HR department of the project determining the best performer team members; after they are determined, another department in the project chooses which member will go to which city. Some of these cities are considered to be better than others, for this reason, to prevent favoritism when choosing the cities, the name of the high performers are kept hidden until the cities are chosen. Although this is defined to be a ground-rule, one of the project team members and an HR personnel violates this rule and this caused several rumors within the organization.

What should the project manager do?

A) To ensure transparency, send an email to everyone and explain this violation did not affect the cities chosen

B) Announce this year no one will be given a holiday as a gift because of the violation

Correct answer
C) Discuss the violation together with the team member, the HR personnel, and their managers and understand the case; then determine a punishment together with the managers of these members

D) Talk to the team member and the HR personnel about the issue individually first, then discuss the issue with their managers; finally, decide how to punish them

Overall explanation
Violation of ground rules may require punishments. If you have chosen D, please note that it is better to decide the punishment together with the managers of the team members in such a case. This behavior can be helpful to provide transparency for everyone. Besides this, with this behavior, the punishment will also be more agreeable.

Question 16
Skipped
Although most of the requirements are unclear, there are clear regulatory requirements and the project manager wants to ensure the team has a great understanding of these requirements for the Project. While doing so, it is also important to have the team’s full support and commitment to the project.

Which approaches could be helpful for the project manager to achieve these goals?

(Choose the best two answers)

Correct selection
A) Involving the cross-functional team members in the kick-off meeting

B) Holding brainstorming sessions with team members

C) Using questionnaires and surveys to ensure they understood the regulatory requirements

Correct selection
D) Involving the team members in decision-making meetings on the prototype

E) Delegating the team leaders to explain to their team the regulatory requirements

Overall explanation
In the kick-off meeting, people will talk about the regulatory requirements and they will work together to come up with the project charter draft (and this will provide team member's support and commitment). To be able to make decisions on the prototype, the decision-makers need to have a clear understanding of the regulatory requirements (and other requirements which are known at that moment); therefore, while providing team member’s support and commitment, the project manager can also ensure the team has a great understanding of the regulatory requirements, too. Brainstorming cannot be helpful for the team to understand the regulatory requirements. Questionnaires and surveys do not provide full support and commitment of the team members. Although delegating the team leaders can also be helpful, options A and D are more collaborative approaches and therefore these approaches would give better results.

Question 17
Skipped
CPI and SPI values of a project are both calculated to be 1. During a meeting, you have presented these values to stakeholders. One of the key stakeholders says: «I am not satisfied with the deliverables.» Which of the following may be the reason for this problem?

A) The project is not on the budget

B) Monte Carlo analysis is not conducted

C) The project is not on the schedule

Correct answer
D) ​The scope is not defined successfully

Overall explanation
Since CPI and SPI are both equal to 1, we conclude that the project is on budget and on schedule. The main reason for the problem may be related to defining the scope. Monte Carlo analysis is irrelevant in this situation.

Question 18
Skipped
The procurement manager is about to start the negotiations with a prospective subcontractor named ABC Consulting.

What should the project manager of the buyer organization do before the negotiations?

(Choose the best three answers)

Correct selection
A) Check the project charter about the objectives of the project

B) Determine a strategy to win the negotiation

Correct selection
C) Get ready to determine the boundaries of the project together with the seller

Correct selection
D) Look over the request for proposal requirements to get ready for the negotiation

E) Give enough information to the procurement manager so that the procurement manager can handle the negotiation by himself

F) Tell the seller company that the procurement manager is in charge of the negotiation and they need to obey whatever he says

Overall explanation
The project manager needs to determine a strategy to follow during the negotiation but this strategy should establish a win-win situation; he/she shouldn’t aim to ‘win’ the negotiation. To determine the best strategy, he/she needs to clearly understand the project objective therefore it is a good idea to check the project charter about the project objectives. Besides this, looking over the request for proposal will also be helpful for the negotiation. Determining the boundaries together with the seller could improve the collaborative relationship between the buyer and the seller, therefore this is a good idea. Although it is the Procurement Manager who leads the negotiations, the project manager should also attend the negotiations; therefore, the procurement manager does not need to handle the negotiation by himself. The negotiations should be conducted in a collaborative environment and no one has to put in a situation in which he/she needs to obey everything the other party says.

Question 19
Skipped
You are appointed to be the project manager of a project that has already been initiated. The previous project manager gave you all information you need to know about the project. You are now reviewing the schedule management plan for the project. In the schedule management plan, you should not expect to see:

A) Software information to be used for scheduling

B) Reporting templates to be used during the project

Correct answer
C) Project’s ongoing schedule progress

D) ​Schedule change control procedures

Overall explanation
The project’s ongoing schedule progress is not a part of the schedule management plan. The schedule management plan is about how to plan, manage and control the schedule of the project.

Question 20
Skipped
Which of the following options is not true about team building activities?

A) Creating the Work Breakdown Structure is one of the team-building activities

B) Team building activities start at the very beginning of the project

Correct answer
C) Each individual is responsible for improving and managing the interaction with others

D) ​There should be trust between team members, and improving it is the responsibility of the project manager

Overall explanation
Improving and managing interaction with others is the project manager’s responsibility. All other answers are true about the team building activities.

Question 21
Skipped
Estimate Activity Resources is one of the Resource Management processes. Which of the following options is not an action for this process?

A) Reviewing resource existence

B) Reviewing the resource management plan

C) Creating a plan for the type of resources to be used

Correct answer
D) ​Analyzing reserves needed for each activity

Overall explanation
«Reserve Analyses» is part of the Estimate Activity Durations process (it is a data analysis tool) and it is not involved in the Estimate Activity Resources process.

Question 22
Skipped
During a meeting about schedule preparation, you got the duration estimations from your team members. When you review the estimations and compare them with your own estimations, you see that there are huge differences. You asked the responsible team member about this difference. He says: «To stay on the safe side, we have added some extra time to durations.» What should you do?

A) This is called reserve analysis and this is acceptable; do nothing and move on to the next step

B) This is called padding. Since padding is not allowed, use your own estimations instead of this team member’s estimation

Correct answer
C) Ask the team member to come up with optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration estimations until the next meeting

D) ​To follow the schedule easily, accept these durations and move on to the next step

Overall explanation
This is called padding and padding is not allowed. Asking the team member to come up with optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimations will prevent padding. If you have answered B, this means you haven’t read the rest of the answer carefully. Using your own estimations is not acceptable in this situation.

Question 23
Skipped
During the preparation of the project’s schedule, you came up with an end date which is exceeding the deadline of the project. You don’t have any extra personnel resources. Which of the following options may be the best option in this situation?

A) Performing critical chain method

B) Crashing the project

Correct answer
C) Fast-tracking the project

D) Resource leveling

Overall explanation
Since you don’t have any extra personnel resources, fast-tracking is the best option in this situation.

Question 24
Skipped
Being the project manager, you are about to decide to buy or rent construction equipment. Which of the following techniques will not be helpful when making this decision?

A) Net Present Value

B) Payback Period

C) Discounted Cash Flow

Correct answer
D) Earned Value

Overall explanation
Net present value, payback period, discounted cash flow, internal rate of return, and return on investment are some techniques used for making these kinds of decisions.

Question 25
Skipped
Which of the following options can be considered to be a team-building activity?

Correct answer
A) Tight Matrix

B) Audits

C) Monitor Communications

D) Performance Reporting

Overall explanation

A) Analogous estimating

B) One-point estimating

Correct answer
C) Bottom-up estimating

D) Specification limit estimating

Overall explanation
The bottom-up estimating technique is the best technique used for creating accurate cost estimates.
Question 27
Skipped
During the negotiations with the prospective sellers, the buyer and the seller organizations discussed lots of items. But after the negotiations, it is realized that some of the important items haven’t been discussed during the negotiations. This will cause the procurement process to be completed late and because of this reason, there might be a project delay.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Added contingency reserve to the schedule so that the delay could be compensated

B) Defined the risk of project delay due to delayed procurement process, in the risk register

C) Provided a negotiation strategy to determine the boundaries

Correct answer
D) Prioritized the items to be negotiated

Overall explanation
The project manager should have defined the risk of project delay due to delayed procurement process and added contingency reserve to the schedule, but these actions will not prevent the project delay. He/she should have provided a negotiation strategy to determine the boundaries but this is not about what we are looking for in the question. Prioritizing the items to be negotiated will help him/her to determine the items to be negotiated first. Therefore, these important items will be negotiated for sure and the delay would be prevented.

Question 28
Skipped
At the beginning of the project, you have added a contingency reserve for the failure of the shoring wall. Right now, all the backfilling activities are done and the risk of the failure of the shoring wall became zero. What should you do about the contingency reserve regarding the shore failure?

A) Do nothing; if some other risks occur in the future, you may use this reserve for that risk

B) Transfer this contingency reserve amount to another risk

Correct answer
C) Remove this contingency reserve from the cost baseline

D) Ask the customer what to do

Overall explanation
If a risk no longer exists, the contingency reserve regarding that risk should return to the company.

Question 31
Skipped
The customer wants a high-quality product. They are known to be having strict pricing rules and sometimes they may be ‘rude’ when it comes to talking about the costs. The project manager and the procurement manager have determined the boundaries and objectives to negotiate with the customer and prioritized the items to be negotiated.

What should they do next?

Correct answer
A) Determine a collaborative negotiation strategy because collaboration is always the best approach

B) Determine a strategy to take up a tough stance against prices because if the customer wants a high-quality product they need to accept the prices as they are

C) Determine an acceptable budget estimate in detail and increase all the prices by 20% to leave room to negotiate

D) Ask the Sponsor who has good relationships with the customer what to do

Overall explanation
Determining a collaborative negotiation strategy is always the best approach.

Question 32
Skipped

A) Process Map

B) Tally Sheet

Correct answer
C) Ishikawa Diagram

D) Control Chart

Overall explanation
Using an Ishikawa diagram (or in other words cause and effect diagram or fishbone diagram) is an effective way of finding the root cause of a problem.
Question 33
Skipped
The project manager, the product manager, the project scheduler, and the cost controller will participate in a negotiation with the buyer. They determined the boundaries and objectives, prioritized the items to be negotiated, and determined a negotiation strategy; therefore, they are well prepared for the negotiation. Based on the negotiation strategy they determined, every team member has a defined role in the negotiation. However, right before the negotiation, the cost controller seems to be reluctant about his role.

What should the project manager do?

A) Get ready to take over the role of the cost controller during the negotiation

B) Remind the cost controller that everyone has a role in the negotiation and he is responsible for his role during the negotiation

C) Encourage the cost controller to talk in a self-assured way during the negotiation; this is required to win the negotiation

Correct answer
D) Remind the cost controller of the basics of his role and tell him not to worry about anything in such a collaborative environment

Overall explanation
During the negotiation, it is important for all the team members to understand their roles; they all need to have a clear agreement about the strategy they will follow and they need to act their roles based on the strategy they determined. In case any of the team members seem to be reluctant about his/her role, the project manager should use his/her leadership skills to encourage the member. Although both C and D are indicating an encouraging leadership style, option C talks about winning the negotiation. In negotiations, our aim should not be winning the negotiation; the negotiations are not win-lose situations. We need to provide a collaborative environment and for this reason, option D is the best option.

Question 34
Skipped
The negotiation is successfully over and the project manager, the procurement manager, and other team members have just arrived at the head office.

What should the project manager do next?

A) Ask the procurement manager to start working on the contract, it should be signed soon

B) Email an executive summary of the negotiation to key stakeholders and ask if further information is needed

Correct answer
C) Review the boundaries and verify the agreed-upon items are satisfying the objectives

D) Ask the key stakeholders for approval so that the project work can start immediately

Overall explanation
Before sending an executive summary, the project manager needs to get ready to address the key stakeholders’ concerns about the agreed-upon items. Therefore, right after the negotiation, it might be a good idea to review the boundaries and verify the agreed-upon items are satisfying the objectives.

Question 35
Skipped
The third sprint is completed and the team has demonstrated the completed product and the backlog is updated. Now they have another meeting that is expected to be completed in 2 hours.

Which approach is suitable for this meeting?

Correct answer
A) The team discusses their weaknesses and strengths

B) The product owner tries to find the root cause of the problems that occurred during the sprint

C) The team discusses if the increments are satisfying the requirements or not

D) The product owner evaluates the completed product by considering the customer and market needs

Overall explanation
In the question, it says ‘the team has demonstrated the completed product and the backlog is updated’; therefore, we understand that the sprint review is done and they are about to start the retrospective meeting. In the retrospective meeting, the team discusses their weaknesses and strengths and they will play for their strengths in the following iterations. Option B is done not only by the product owner, it is done by the team altogether. Options C and D are done in the sprint review, not in the retrospective. Therefore, the best answer is A.

A software project was stopped temporarily due to a juridical event. Last week, the court said the project could continue until the final decision has made. The cross-functional team started working on the project immediately but since the court hasn’t made a permanent order yet, the team morale is decreased and it needs to be rebuilt. Now, there is a technical issue with the project.

What should the project manager do about the technical issue?

A) Use a fishbone diagram to find the root cause of the problem

Correct answer
B) Ask the team to think of solutions for the problem

C) Wait for the next retrospective meeting, to come up with a solution

D) Use leadership skills to rebuild the team morale

Overall explanation
To empower the team members and make them accountable for their actions, it is a good idea to ask them to think of solutions for the problem. They are experts about what they are doing and for this reason, they can find the solution by themselves. The project manager should not try to solve the problem by himself/herself, and waiting for the next retrospective meeting may cause project delay. The project manager will use leadership skills to rebuild the team morale but this action is not directly related to the technical issue. For this reason, the best answer is B.

Question 38
Skipped
ABCONX, a huge construction company, awarded your company a very small project. Normally, your company is too big to do this kind of a small project, but you know, if you complete this project successfully, your chance of being awarded a huge project of ABCONX next year will be very high. Management of your company states that the most important constraint of the project is quality. During the beginning of the project, a major problem with quality has occurred. Which of the following action is most suitable in this situation?

A) Fixing the problem immediately

B) Asking ABCONX if they allow these kinds of quality problems

Correct answer
C) Fixing the root cause of the problem even if it causes increased cost

D) Asking your sponsor what to do

Overall explanation
Since the most important constraint is quality, the most suitable action will be searching for the root cause of the problem and fixing it. Remember, Fixing the root cause is always a better option than fixing the problem itself!

What should the project manager do?

A) Take the upgrade because it is free and it won’t affect the project budget

B) Explain the offer to the team members and ask them if he could take the upgrade or not

Correct answer
C) Don’t take the upgrade

D) Make a phone call with the sponsor and ask her if he could take the upgrade or not

Overall explanation
The project manager is a model for the project team. Although the upgrade is free, taking it and leaving the team members behind may harm the team spirit. For this reason, it is a good idea not to take the upgrade in such a situation.

B) Conduct a pre-training assessment to determine the current skill level of the team members

Correct answer
C) Hold a meeting with software engineers to talk about the training options

D) Pair the team members so that they can learn from each other

Overall explanation
Since the training need is determined, now it is time to determine the training options. It is a good idea to determine the training options with the team members and choose the best option with them together. For this reason, holding a meeting with software engineers to talk about the training options will be the best answer.

Question 42
Skipped
Some of the work packages in the project require competencies. The project manager and the team members determined which training should be provided to improve the team member skills. They decided to train the individuals one-by-one based on their training needs. After the training sessions is over, they started working on the work packages. During project implementation, it is realized that the skill level of some team members is not sufficient enough therefore additional training will be needed for those team members. But providing such training will take time and because of this reason, they will have to face the risk of project delay.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Provided team training in addition to individual training to improve the skills better

B) Added a contingency reserve to the schedule to compensate for the delay

C) Planned the risk responses for the project delay risk

Correct answer
D) Conducted post-training assessments and determined further training needs

Overall explanation
After providing the training, the project manager needs to measure the training outcomes. If the team members have not reached the desired skill level, he/she will determine further training needs. If the project manager had conducted pre-, and post-training assessments and measured the training outcomes before starting the project work, they could provide additional training before starting the project work and they would not have to face the risk of project delay.

You are calculating the performance of your project. If the actual cost is $80,000, the planned value is $70,000 and the earned value is $65,000, what is the cost performance index?

Correct answer
A) 0.813

B) 0.875

C) 1.231

D) 1.143

Overall explanation
Let’s remember the formula for CPI: CPI = Earned Value / Actual Cost CPI = $65,000 / $80,000 = 0.813
Question 44
Skipped
The project budget is being prepared. The Sponsor said this year the training budget for the project should not exceed $50,000; there is an economic crisis and they can’t afford the training cost exceeding this figure. The project manager knows the team members from previous projects. Based on the competencies required for this project, they will need to be trained in networking and project management. The project manager has calculated the training budget as $150,000.

What should the project manager do?

A) Since they can't afford a training cost exceeding $50,000, search for cheaper training options. To fit in the $50,000 budget, maybe it is a good idea to postpone some of the training events

B) Prepare the project budget by considering the training budget as $150,000. If the Sponsor objects to the training budget during the approval process, bargain and take a budget as high as possible

Correct answer
C) Explain to the Sponsor why the training is critical for the team and why they need a $150,000 training budget. Ask the Sponsor to rethink this decision

D) Get advice from a consultancy firm to see which training can be provided for $50,000

Overall explanation
If the project team needs training, not providing the training may be much costly than providing the training. Because, if the training is not provided, the team performance may not be as it should be, or it may even cause rework because of mistakes and etc. For this reason, to convince the sponsor, it is a good idea to explain the criticality of the training.

Question 45
Skipped
Dispersed team members of a software development project are located in five different countries; India, United States, Canada, Estonia, and Saudi Arabia. The project is just about to start and the project manager is working on a strategy to start the project. There are three options:

I) Invite the team members to the head office to meet in person and discuss the project. Then hold a virtual kick-off meeting to formally start the project.

II) Visit each team to get to know each other face-to-face. Then send an email including an attachment explaining how they should satisfy the project needs, and tell them to start working on the project.

III) Visit each team to meet with each other face-to-face and talk about the project needs. Then hold a virtual kick-off meeting to formally start the project.

Analyze the given options.

A) Not a good one: I, Could be better: II, A good one: III

B) Not a good one: I, Could be better: III, A good one: II

C) Not a good one: II, Could be better: I, A good one: III

Correct answer
D) Not a good one: II, Could be better: III, A good one: I

E) Not a good one: III, Could be better: I, A good one: II

F) Not a good one: III, Could be better: II, A good one: I

Overall explanation
We need to hold a kick-off meeting to start the project. Since option II does not include a kick-off meeting, this is not a good one. Meeting in-person increases the trust level between the team members, but it is also important for the team members to meet with each other in person too. If the project manager visits each team, the team members will not have the opportunity to meet with each other. Since inviting the team members to the head office will provide an opportunity not only for the project manager but also for the team members to meet in person, this option is better than visiting each person. Therefore, the best answer is D.

A) The project manager of the project

B) The responsible manager of the mechanical group of the project

C) The sponsor and the project manager of the project

Correct answer
D) The responsible manager of the mechanical group and the project manager

Overall explanation
To solve the problem, you should meet with individuals who are involved in the problem. The first individual is the responsible manager of the mechanical group. Then this will require the project manager to get involved in this meeting.
Question 48
Skipped
A virtual project team used to work in harmony with each other. But since three weeks, negative communications and the number of conflicts between team members have been increased and it is getting worse every day.

What should the project manager do?

(Choose the best two options)

A) Talk to the team leaders about the issue and ask them to solve the communication problem

Correct selection
B) Determine the engagement level of the team members and then find the root cause of the problem with the help of team leaders

C) To improve the team morale, hold a virtual celebration for the completed parts of the project

Correct selection
D) Check the team charter and implement the conflict resolution techniques indicated in the charter

E) Send an email to everyone and tell them how you are concerned about the project because of the negative communications. Ask them to improve the communication with each other and focus on their work

Overall explanation
Determining the engagement level of the team members can be helpful to find the root cause of the communication problem. It is a good idea to find the solution with the help of team members too. In the team charter, there is information about the conflict resolution techniques, and these techniques can be applied when resolving the conflicts. Holding a virtual celebration can improve the team member engagement in ‘normal’ conditions, but since there is an ongoing issue within the team, this may not be helpful to resolve the issue. Since three weeks have passed since the issue has started, the team leaders should already have come to the project manager about the issue, otherwise, this means the project manager might have a communication problem with the team leaders. Sending an email and asking them to improve the communication may not be an effective solution in such a case, face-to-face communication would be a better solution.

Question 49
Skipped
The project work for Project A is about to start. A meeting is held to determine the vision of the project. During the meeting, one of the high-authority executives started talking about an issue with another project, Project B. Then the conversation turned into a discussion about finding a solution to the issue for Project B. Now the team members think their project is not an important project for the organization, and this caused them to lose their motivation.

What should the project manager have done to prevent this?

A) Prepared a meeting agenda and sent it to all the attendees before the meeting

B) Advised the executive to only talk about Project A during the meeting

Correct answer
C) Held another meeting before the meeting to set a clear set of rules for meetings

D) Explained to the team members the importance of their project for the organization

Overall explanation
To prevent such and similar situations, the ground rules should be determined before the meeting and everyone should obey these rules during the meetings.

Now you start to think that assigning him to that position was such a bad idea. Which of the following best names this situation?

A) Pre-assignment

Correct answer
B) Halo effect

C) Multi-criteria decision analysis

D) Virtual membership

Overall explanation
Assigning someone to a higher position since he is good at some skills, but these skills are not the main necessity for that higher position is called “Halo Effect”.

(choose two best options)

A) Definition of done

Correct selection
B) Primary objective for the project

Correct selection
C) The customer expectations

D) Product backlog

E) Retrospective findings

Question 53
Skipped
The project is about to start and the project manager is determining a strategy to manage the project. Some of the team members think that this is not a job for women. Neither the customer nor the project manager’s organization has any politics about gender diversity within projects but the project manager knows that ensuring equal representation of women in the project can have positive effects not only for the project but also for the entire organization.

What should the project manager do to increase diversity?

(Choose three best options)

A) Since neither the customer nor the organization has any politics about women's integrity, the project manager should not do anything

Correct selection
B) During the lunch, talk about past experiences about how women integration positively affected the project work

Correct selection
C) Talk about the positive outcomes of gender diversity with the project sponsor

Correct selection
D) Set a 50/50 gender parity rule when hiring team members and ask the subcontractors to apply the same

Overall explanation
When supporting diversity and inclusion, it might be a good idea to take both formal and informal actions. For this reason, talking about past experiences during lunch, talking about her own opinions to the sponsor, and setting a 50/50 gender parity rule are all acceptable efforts.

Question 54
Skipped
XYC Oil is a multinational oil and gas corporation. They will construct a huge onshore processing facility. Due to increased gas prices, the company would like to complete the project as soon as possible; this way they can sell the gas for a considerably profitable price. For this reason, the schedule is the most important constraint for them. They have signed contracts with various vendors, and they subcontracted the piping works to a vendor named ABC Piping. Currently, ABC Piping is establishing metrics for the project. They are about to determine the three most important metrics for them. Which of the following options is the worst decision compared to other options?

Correct answer
A) Metric 1: CPI, Metric 2: CV, Metric 3: EAC

B) Metric 1: Number of completed pipelines, Metric 2: CPI, Metric 3: SPI

C) Metric 1: CV, Metric 2: SV, Metric 3: TCPI

D) Metric 1: SPI, Metric 2: SV, Metric 3: Number of completed milestones

Overall explanation
In the question, it says “the schedule is the most important constraint for them (XYC Oil)”. XYC Oil is the contractor company, therefore it is the customer of ABC Piping. Customer’s priorities are important and it is a good idea to consider these priorities when we establish the metrics. Among the options, Option A is the only one not including any schedule metrics and for this reason, it is considered to be the worst one compared to other options.

Question 55
Skipped
ARCH Co, an architecture firm, just awarded to drawing the architectural drawings for a big hospital project. In this project, they want to deliver a research-driven and community-focused design. Besides there are lots of unknowns with the design, there are also some technical requirements they need to consider for this project.

What approach should the project manager follow in this project?

A) Ask the team members their opinions about the project; talk to the experts about the ideas of the project team and by considering the feedback of the experts, tell the team members how to prepare the drawings

B) Ask the experts for their recommendations about the project and understand these recommendations very well; determine a strategy by considering these recommendations, take the responsibility for the project and explain to the team how to prepare the drawings

Correct answer
C) Hold a meeting to discuss the project with the experts and team members. Ask the experts and team members to work together when preparing the drawings. Ask their needs and support them with the work

D) Hold a meeting with experts to talk about their recommendations about the project; send these recommendations to the team members and explain to them how to prepare the drawings

Overall explanation
Since there are lots of unknowns with the design and there are some technical requirements they need to consider, following an agile approach with some predictive features (ie. a hybrid life cycle) will be the most suitable life cycle for this project. In such an environment, it is expected from the project manager to act as a servant leader. Among the options, only Option C explains a servant leader role (ie. the project manager asks the team to self-organize their work with experts, and then he/she supports their needs).

Question 56
Skipped
The project manager has sent an email to the team. Some of the instructions in the email have caused confusion among team members and as a result, some team members have misunderstood these instructions.

What should the project manager have done to prevent the team members misunderstood the instructions?

A) Created a prototype to make the instructions clearer

B) Explained the instructions, in a meeting before sending the email

Correct answer
C) Considered different possible meanings when writing the email

D) Got assistance from experts

Overall explanation
This question is talking about conceptual ambiguity. As you will remember from the lectures, conceptual ambiguity is the ambiguity due to the structure of the sentence we use when talking about something. Explaining the instructions, in a meeting before sending the email could help prevent the misunderstanding but since the problem is caused because of the email the project manager has sent, using better sentences in the email would solve the root cause. This makes Option C a better option; to prevent conceptual ambiguity, the project manager should have considered different possible meanings when writing the email.

B) Administration

C) Maintaining control over the project

D) Best practices

Correct selection
E) Maintaining communication

Correct selection

Overall explanation
A project manager’s leadership role is layered on top of his/her management capabilities. To inspire, motivate and influence the team and stakeholders, the project manager should focus on maintaining communication, supporting, and removing the obstacles for the team, more.

Question 58
Skipped
Which of the following is the first thing to do about a change that should be made because of an issue or a risk?

A) Identifying change

B) Identifying other options

C) Checking change’s effect on other constraints

Correct answer
D) Preventing the main reason for the change

Overall explanation
Since the question is asking the first thing to do, «Preventing the main reason for the change» will be the best answer. A project manager should always try to prevent changes first instead of dealing with them.

Question 59
Skipped
There are four teams working on a software development project. There are lots of unknowns about the project and except one, all the teams have enough experience with such projects. The ‘exception’ team mostly consists of new graduates and they don’t have enough experience in what they are doing.

What approach should the project manager follow to manage the team?

A) Since there are lots of unknowns, the project manager should apply a directive management style for all the teams. Applying different management styles for different teams may cause the teams to lose their motivation

B) Since there are lots of unknowns, the project manager should apply a servant management style for all the teams. Applying different management styles for different teams may cause the teams to lose their motivation

Correct answer
C) The project manager should apply a servant management style for the experienced teams, and a directive style for the inexperienced teams

D) The project manager should apply a directive management style for the experienced teams, and a servant style for the inexperienced teams

Overall explanation
Servant management style is suitable for experienced teams who can manage their own work without depending on others. If there is an inexperienced team in the project, it might be a good idea to manage them with a directive style until they have enough experience to work on their own.

Question 60
Skipped
The team is creating an app that will help the professionals to manage the project costs more effectively. The team members are very excited about the project because when it is completed, it is going to be one of a kind in the market. During the daily meeting, one of the team members talked about a problem that happened yesterday evening. He said he tried to solve the issue all night but he couldn’t fix it. The project manager realizes that if the issue cannot be solved immediately it may cause a project delay.

What should the project manager do?

A) Try to find the root cause of the problem and solve the issue immediately

B) Ask the team member about the possible reasons for the issue

Correct answer
C) Hold another meeting to discuss the issue with the team

D) Tell the team member to try to solve the issue today; if he can’t fix it, discuss the issue tomorrow in the daily meeting

Overall explanation
During the daily meetings (ie. daily scrum, or daily scrum meetings) the team members talk about what they did yesterday and what they will do today. The team members talk about their problems, but they will not try to solve these issues during the meeting; the purpose of these meetings is not problem-solving. If they try to solve the issues during the daily meeting, other team members who are not related to the problem will be wasting their time listening to others who are talking about the problem. To prevent waste of time, the project manager should hold another meeting to discuss the issue with the team.

Question 61
Skipped
This week an excessive number of impediments are defined. There are lots of items in the project that need to be improved and it seems that the team will not be able to remove all the impediments in the next iteration.

What should the project manager do with this excessive number of impediments?

A) Hire additional team members to remove these impediments

B) Use an impediment board and prioritize the impediments based on their criticality; then escalate the less critical items

C) Since the team members are not working efficiently, remove them and establish a high-performing team by hiring new ones

Correct answer
D) Determine which items are more important than others and improve the items starting from the most crucial ones

Overall explanation
After determining the impediments and the items to be improved, they need to be prioritized by determining which items are more important than others. Then the team will improve the items and remove the impediments starting from the most crucial ones. Please note that this is a better option than escalation and option B is not the best answer for this reason.

Question 62

D) You should update the change log

Overall explanation
Once the project is stopped, it should be closed.

Question 63
Skipped
The software, the team uses for the project, is no longer supporting an important feature of the project and it needs to be upgraded to support that feature; otherwise, the team can no longer work on that feature and this may cause a project delay. The project manager is checking this year’s budget of the project which is prepared by the functional manager and realizes that there is no space to purchase that software in the budget. The functional manager says it is impossible to add this cost to this year’s budget but if the CFO approves, maybe they can add it to next year’s budget.

What should the project manager do?

Correct answer
A) Talk to the CFO, explain why adding the software upgrading cost to this year’s budget has crucial importance for the project, and ask it to be added to this year’s budget

B) Since there is no software upgrade cost in this year’s budget, don’t upgrade the software this year; but make sure it is added to next year’s budget so that the team can upgrade it next year

C) Since this is very critical for the project, tell the project team to upgrade the software; the cost might be compensated from next year’s budget

D) Talk to the project sponsor, explain how adding this cost to the budget is important for the project, and ask it to be added to this year’s budget

Overall explanation
In the question, we understand that the project manager has already talked to the functional manager who prepared the budget and it is the CFO who is approving the budget. Since adding the software update cost to this year’s budget has critical importance for the project, the project manager should go to the CFO and ask it to be added to this year’s budget.

Question 64
Skipped
According to the Tuckman Ladder Model, there are five stages of team establishment and development; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.

The project manager uses KPIs to appraise team member performance in the project. If the KPI value is less than 1000, this means the performance of the team member is not as it is expected. He gets the following results in different stages of the project:

I) KPI = 580

II) KPI = 910

III) KPI = 1000

In which stages could these measurements have been made?

(Choose the best two options)

A) I: Performing, II: Forming, III: Adjourning

Correct selection
B) I: Storming, II: Forming, III: Performing

C) I: Forming, II: Norming, III: Adjourning

D) I: Storming, II: Norming, III: Forming

E) I: Norming, II: Storming, III: Performing

Correct selection
F) I: Storming, II: Norming, III: Performing

Overall explanation
According to the Tuckman Ladder Model, the team member performance is expected to decrease from forming stage to the storming stage; then it gets higher in norming and performing stages. A performance decrease can also be expected when the project is in the adjourning stage. Again, based on this model, the performance is the lowest in the storming stage and it is highest in the performing stage. Based on this information, options B and F are the best answers.

Question 65
Skipped
One of the team members has been working in the same position for about five years. Now he is not very excited about his position anymore and he is asking the project manager to give more challenging leadership responsibilities.

What should the project manager do?

A) Prepare a questionnaire to assess the leadership knowledge of the team member; if he has enough knowledge on leadership, then promote him to a leadership position

B) Ask the team member why he is not excited about his position anymore; remove the impediments so that he can get excited about his position again

C) Ask him to wait until this project is completed; start evaluating his performance and if he performs well, give him a leadership opportunity in the next project

Correct answer
D) Check the team member’s CV, and KPI score; talk to him about his expectations and if the results are good, give him leadership opportunities starting from leading a small team

Overall explanation
The project manager needs to support team member growth and development. Since he has been working for five years, it might be a good idea to give him some leadership opportunities. But to do that, the project manager needs to be ensured about the team leader can handle leadership positions. Checking the team member’s CV will give the project manager idea about the team member’s past experiences, and the KPI score will be helpful to see how this team member is performing. If the results are good, it might be a good idea to give him leadership opportunities and he can do this by leading small teams. If you have chosen option A, please note that measuring team member performance is an ongoing activity and the project manager should have already measured the team member’s performance.

A successful senior project manager of a software development project named Project A is just assigned to another project. Now, you are appointed to be the new project manager of this Project named Project A. This will be your first experience as a project manager, and you are very excited. What should you do first?

A) Ask the senior project manager’s opinion about what to do now

B) Close the project or phase

Correct answer

Question 67
Skipped
A newly graduated team member is responsible for preparing daily progress reports. Today, the first daily report has published but the project manager is not satisfied with the data representation in the report.

What should the project manager do?

Correct answer
A) Talk to the team member privately in the face and explain expectations about the daily report directly

B) Wait for a few days to see if the team member fixes the report; if it is not fixed, send an email to the team member to explain expectations about the daily report

C) Since the team member is not experienced in preparing daily progress reports, assign this job to a more experienced team member

D) Explain to the team member the expectations about the daily report during the meeting; ask him to prepare the reports by considering these expectations

Overall explanation
Giving feedback can be helpful for supporting team member growth; therefore, the project manager should explain his/her expectations about the daily report directly. But while doing that, it is important to consider this is a newly graduated team member, and talking to him privately in the face would be better than talking to him in a meeting.

Skipped
The customer wants an application that works only on the Android operating system. You have completed the project and delivered the application to the customer on time. You tell the customer that the application works not only on Android but also on IOS and this is a gift from you. The customer says they have a legal problem with IOS, therefore they cannot use an application that works on IOS. You then start to make changes and it costs you an extra $10,000 and 2 more months to meet the required corrections. What is the main problem in this situation?

A) Customer should have informed you about the legal problem before starting to project

B) The project management plan may not be prepared correctly

Correct answer
C) You should not have added extras to the project, it should not be allowed

D) ​A proper Work Breakdown Structure hasn’t been prepared

Overall explanation
Adding extras to a project or in other words “Gold Plating” is not allowed. Gold plating may cause these kinds of problems.

Question 69
Skipped
Here is a list of some activities carried out at the onset of the project:

I) WBS and WBS dictionary are created

II) Statement of work of the project is created

III) The planning team is determined

IV) Budget is developed

What should be the correct order of these activities?

Correct answer
A) II – III – I – IV

B) III – II – I – IV

C) IV – III – I – II

D) ​II – I – IV – III

Overall explanation
The statement of work of the project (SOW) is created before starting the project; therefore, without the SOW, WBS and WBS dictionary cannot be created. But to create the WBS, the planning team should be determined because they will be the “main workers” of this activity. Among the listed activities, developing the budget comes last. Therefore, the correct order of these activities should be: II – III – I - IV

Question 70
Skipped

The project is planned to complete in 3 years. A massive amount of a specific material will be used at various times during the life cycle of the project. The diagram represents the price change of this material over time during the first 9 weeks of the project. The project manager needs to make a decision about the best time to buy the material.

When making the decision, the project manager will need an alternatives analysis in which of these weeks, more than the other weeks? (Choose two best options)

Correct selection
A) Week 1

Correct selection
B) Week 3

C) Week 5

D) Week 7

E) Week 9

Overall explanation
On the diagram, we see that there is high volatility until the fourth week. Then, starting from the fifth week, the prices are stable; in other words, the volatility is low in the following weeks. Alternatives analysis can be very helpful in highly volatile environments. Therefore, the project manager will need to make an alternatives analysis more, in the first four weeks.

Question 71
Skipped
Since the project team performance was decreased, the project manager provided training both for the team and the team members. Besides this, the project manager offered feedback to the team members who could not satisfy the expectations and also provided formal and informal coaching sessions to the team.

Now for the next stage, which of the following options will not be helpful?

(Choose the best two options)

A) Velocity chart

Correct selection
B) Relative sizing

Correct selection
C) Tuckman Ladder Model

D) Throughput metrics

E) Burn-up chart

F) Information radiator

Overall explanation
The project manager provided training, offered feedback, and provided coaching sessions to improve the project performance. Now it is time to verify if these efforts have increased the performance or not. Please note that if the project performance increases, we can comment that the team member performance has also increased. Since we are looking for options that will not be helpful for the next stage, we need to search for the options that cannot be helpful either to measure the project performance or to see the project performance. Relative sizing and Tuckman Ladder Model cannot be used for measuring project performance. If one of your answers was the Information radiator, please note that on the Information radiator we may have reports, graphs, and charts that are giving us information about the project performance.

A) It shows the relationships between activities

Correct answer
B) It helps to communicate with stakeholders

C) It shows the progress of the project

D) ​It shows the budget of the project

Question 73
Skipped
The IT team in a construction project is developing an application that will help the construction, project controls, accounting, and finance teams to have better communication with each other and this will contribute to speed up the construction project. The application project was supposed to be completed 6 months ago with a $100,000 budget, but today it is not completed yet. They have spent $150,000 until now and this issue caused an argument between the Finance Manager and the IT Manager. The Finance Manager says they need to stop the project because it has already exceeded the budget, but the IT Manager says the IT team is about to complete the application and all they need is 3 more months.

What should the project manager do?

A) Stop the project immediately because it exceeded the budget and missed the deadline

B) Talk to the IT Manager and the Finance Manager and let them explain why they are arguing with each other; this might be an opportunity to find the best solution to the issue

C) Read the performance report of this application project, review the project documentation to understand if completing the project will contribute to the construction project or not, and make a decision accordingly

Correct answer
D) Talk to the IT and Finance Managers and ask their concerns, discuss your findings of the project; ask other leaders about their opinions and make a decision

Overall explanation
Here, we have a very complicated situation. There is a troubling application project within the construction project and it needs to be fixed. Besides this, this troubled project caused a conflict between two leaders, and this issue also needs to be solved; we can’t solve the conflict without talking to IT and Finance Managers. And we also need to review the project documentation and discuss our findings too. Then, since there are other stakeholders (ie. the construction, project controls, and accounting teams) their opinions should also be asked. Finally, the project manager can make a decision accordingly.

Question 74
Skipped
The project has started two months ago, and two of the team members are arguing with each other for the third time during the project.

What should the project manager do?

A) As a leader, talk to team members and explain to them why they need to work in a collaborative manner with each other

Correct answer
B) Find out why and how their hostility started by talking to the team members separately

C) Find the root cause of the arguments by talking to people who have worked closely with these team members before

D) Do nothing, because this is the storming stage and these kinds of arguments are expected during this stage. It will get better in the norming and performing stages

Overall explanation
The project manager needs to find out the root cause of the conflicts; finding out why and how their hostility started will help with this. Although it might be a good idea to talking to people who have worked closely with these team members, it is not the best option because the best option should include talking to the team members separately. For this reason, the best answer is B.

Question 75
Skipped
All defined risks should be sorted so that, the risks requiring an immediate response become visible. Which of the following may help you during this process?

A) Tornado diagram

B) Expected monetary value analysis

Correct answer
C) Probability and impact matrix

D) Monte Carlo analysis

Overall explanation
The probability and impact matrix can help you to sort ALL defined risks. Other options are used for numerically analyzing not all but some of the risks (the important risks).

Question 76
Skipped
While you are creating the shortlist of risks, you determined a risk that is categorized to be an urgent risk. As the project manager, which of the following options is the best action for you at this moment?

A) Quantitative risk analysis should be done immediately

Correct answer
B) Risk should be moved immediately to the Risk Response Planning

C) Control the risk immediately

D) Take advice from the senior project manager of another project

Overall explanation
A risk is categorized to be an urgent risk if it occurs soon or planning a response may require a very long time. Either way, it should be moved immediately to Risk Response Planning while the rest of the risks can continue through quantitative risk analysis.

Question 77
Skipped
Greg and Ali had an argument about a solution to a process. Greg was saying this was the only solution that could work but Ali was disagreeing with this idea. The project manager investigated the problem and found out that Greg was right. Although this is the case, Ali still continues to insist this solution will not work.

What should the project manager do?

(Choose the best two options)

Correct selection
A) Tell the team to prepare a roadmap about the solution; then discuss this roadmap with Ali and try to convince him by explaining to him that this is the best solution

B) Ask Ali’s team leader to convince Ali of the solution; tell the team not to start working on the solution and wait until all the parties are agreed with the solution

C) Tell the team to start working on the solution; offer Ali two options, he can either work collaboratively with all the team members, or he can leave the project

Correct selection
D) Tell the team to start working on the solution; talk with Greg and Ali separately and find out a way in which they can work collaboratively

Overall explanation
Since the project manager is investigated the problem and found out that Greg was right, now they can start working on the solution. But while doing that, he/she needs to convince Ali of the solution and find out a way in which Ali and Greg can work collaboratively.

Question 78
Skipped
Which of the following strategies is more suitable for a low-priority and low impact threat?

A) Avoid

B) Mitigate

Correct answer
C) Transfer

D) Enhance

Overall explanation
Avoiding and mitigating strategies are more suitable for high-priority and high-impact risks. Enhance is a strategy used for opportunities, not for threats. Transferring is the most suitable strategy for this situation.
Question 79
Skipped
The project manager used to provide mentoring sessions at the beginning of the project but nowadays, the project’s workload became very high and it is very hard to allocate time for mentoring sessions.

What should the project manager do?

A) Stop the mentoring sessions for a while until the workload becomes normal; the project work is more important than anything else

Correct answer
B) Search and find alternative ways for allocating time for mentoring sessions

C) Instead of allocating time for mentoring sessions during these busy times, recommend mentoring books for team members so that they can read in their spare time

D) Use contingency reserve in the schedule to create time for mentoring sessions

Overall explanation
Mentoring role of the project manager is an important role that can help others to improve themselves and increase their engagement to the project. For this reason, it is a good idea to search and find alternative ways for allocating time for mentoring sessions, even the workload is very high.

Question 80
Skipped
You are a project manager for a huge project. Today is Monday and each Monday there is a coordination meeting with your project team. Which of the following will most probably be the most important thing to be discussed in this meeting?

A) The progress of the project

B) The budget for the project

Correct answer
C) Risks of the project

D) Schedule of the project

Overall explanation
During the project team meetings, the most important items will be the risks of the project.

Question 81
Skipped
During project planning, you have determined all risks and made qualitative and quantitative risk analyses. You have added a contingency reserve to your budget for a specific risk. Now it is the middle of the project and this risk no longer exists. What should you do with the contingency reserve related to this risk?

A) Do nothing, you may use this reserve for an unforeseen risk in the future

B) Transfer this contingency reserve to another risk for future use

Correct answer
C) You should remove this reserve, it should turn back to the company

D) You should transfer this contingency reserve to the management reserve

Overall explanation
If a risk no longer exists, all reserves regarding this risk should turn back to the company.

Question 82
Skipped
You have just found the ends of the estimation range to be about +/- 2 sigmas from the mean. Which of the following range estimates is riskiest?

A) Mean of 100 days

B) 80 days +/- 7 days

Correct answer
C) 75 days to 92 days

D) Pessimistic: 103 days, Most Likely: 94 days, Optimistic: 88 days

Overall explanation
The widest range will be the riskiest one. “Mean of 100 days” is not a range, therefore, we eliminate this option first.  The range for “80 days +/- 7 days” is 7 + 7 = 14 days.  The range for “75 days to 92 days” is 92 – 75 = 17 days.  The range for “Pessimistic: 103 days, Most Likely: 94 days, Optimistic: 88 days” is 103 – 88 = 15 days.  Since the widest range is 17 days, “75 days to 92 days” is the best answer.

Question 83
Skipped
You are the project manager of the subcontractor company and it is almost the middle of the project. The project manager of the contractor company said: «For a specific work which is not written in the contract, we will pay you an extra $100,000.» You know that $100,000 is a very profitable value for that work. What should you do?

A) Since it is not written in the contract, you should not accept the offer.

B) Since $100,000 is a very profitable value, you should accept the offer immediately and do the work.

Correct answer
C) Ask the project manager of the contractor company for a formal change to the contract

D) Do nothing, since you are responsible for the work only written in the contract.

Overall explanation
In real life, you may often encounter such situations. You may want to get the job right away because it is a profitable business. However, the relevant work and all related conditions must first be added to the contract formally.

Question 84
Skipped
At the beginning of the project, the project manager decided to apply a directive management style because most of the team members didn’t have any experience with this kind of project. After five successful months, currently, the team members learned most of the technical skills required to do the job but they are still not yet ready to do the work by themselves.

How should the project manager lead the team members?

A) The project manager should let the team members do the work by themselves because this is the only way they can learn how to do the work by themselves

B) The project manager should apply a supporting style because the team members need support

Correct answer
C) The project manager should apply a coaching style because the team members have the technical skills

D) The project manager should continue applying a directive style because team members cannot do the work by themselves

Overall explanation
According to Kenneth Blanchard’s Situational Leadership 2 Model, the project manager should apply a coaching style because the team members have some knowledge and skills but they are not competent yet.

Question 85
Skipped
You are the procurement manager for a large project in which the budget is the most important constraint among other constraints. The PMP certified project manager asks you to subcontract a specific work package immediately. He said: «Since this is an emergency, we need to prepare a fixed price contract». The design phase of this work package is not ready; therefore, the scope is not well defined yet. Which of the following is true in this situation?

A) Preparing a fixed price contract will be very advantageous because this will fasten the bidding process

B) Fixed price contract types are always better than other contract types because the buyer’s risk is less compared to others

C) Since he is the project manager, you need to do whatever he wants without making any comment

Correct answer
D) If you prepare a fixed price contract in this situation, this work package will most probably be too expensive

Overall explanation
Since the scope is not well defined, the seller will be forced to a high level of risk, and they will most probably add huge amounts of reserves to their prices. Therefore, this work package will be too expensive in this situation.

Question 86
Skipped
You are not sure about whether to prepare a fixed price incentive fee (FPIF) or fixed price award fee (FPAF) type of contract. What is the main difference between these two contract types?

Correct answer
A) The award is judged subjectively but the incentive is judged objectively

B) The award is judged objectively but the incentive is judged subjectively

C) Both incentive and award are judged subjectively but FPIF contract is prepared faster

D) Both incentive and award are judged objectively but FPAF contract is prepared faster

Overall explanation
If it is a fixed price award fee contract, the award is judged subjectively, but in a fixed price incentive fee contract, the incentive is judged objectively and this is the main difference between them.

Question 87
Skipped
You are the project manager of the seller company. Which of the following contract types is less risky for you?

A) Cost plus incentive fee

Correct answer
B) Cost plus fixed fee

C) Fixed price incentive fee

D) Time and material

What are the opportunities the project manager can seize to mentor the project team?

(Choose the best three options)

Correct selection
A) Retrospectives

B) Information radiator

C) Brainstorming sessions

Correct selection
D) Sprint review

E) Kanban board

Correct selection
F) Lessons learned sessions

Overall explanation
Retrospectives, sprint reviews, and lessons learned sessions are some opportunities that the project manager can seize to mentor the project team. Please note that the project manager can use any activity or a meeting as a mentoring opportunity. Even in a brainstorming session, he/she can mentor the project team. But since the purpose of retrospectives, sprint review and lessons learned sessions are talking about what we did right and what we did wrong, these three are more suitable for mentoring sessions; in other words, these three are better options than the brainstorming session.

Question 90
Skipped
Sometimes, there might be some changes to the contract after it is signed. For most of the cases, who has the authority for making such a change to the contract?

A) Project manager

B) Sponsor

C) Customer

Question 91
Skipped
During a meeting, two teams are blaming each other for an unsolved issue. The testing team says there is a problem with coding but the developers insist the problem is the testing approach they use. Now they start speaking louder to each other; it looks like the team members lost their temper.

What should the project manager do?

A) Tell the development team to stop blaming the testing team, because the testing approach has already been approved before starting the project and the development team should accept the testing results

B) Listen to all the teams carefully until the meeting is over; after the meeting, analyze the issue, find the root cause and email the solution you found based on your findings

C) The least talking team should be wrong; use emotional intelligence to calm down the other team and directly tell the least talking team they are wrong

Correct answer
D) Call for a 15-minute break and ask the team leaders to think about a strategy to solve the problem during the break; after the break let the team leaders talk one at a time about their strategies

Overall explanation
The project manager should use his/her emotional intelligence to calm down the team members and make them focus on the solution to the issue. Calling for a break is a good idea to calm down the team members. Then asking the team leaders to think about a strategy to solve the problem will make them focus on how to solve the problem instead of thinking about who is wrong and who is right. Letting team leaders talk one at a time could prevent them from arguing again.

Question 92
Skipped
You are the project manager for a midsized project. During a meeting, you and your team are arguing about submitted proposals for a specific work package.

Skipped
Which of the following options is correct about stakeholders and stakeholder management?

A) All of the stakeholders are identified in the Planning process group

Correct answer
B) A stakeholder who is not identified at the beginning may cause a delay

C) The project manager should identify all of the stakeholders by himself/herself

D) Stakeholder register is done during Plan Stakeholder Engagement

Overall explanation
Any stakeholder not identified at the beginning of the project will be discovered later and most probably they will make change requests. Because of these change requests, delays may occur.

Question 95
Skipped

Question 96
Skipped
You are hired as the project manager. You are about to start creating the project management plan. In what detail, should you prepare the project management plan?

Correct answer
A) The application area and the complexity of the project should be considered to determine the level of detail

B) To make it understandable to everyone, it should be a summary of data or a high-level plan

C) To create a well-prepared plan, it should be as detailed as possible

D) Ask your high-level managers and prepare the plan only the level of detail they want

Overall explanation
The level of detail of the project management plan depends on the application area and the complexity of the project. For some projects, even a high-level plan can be enough but for some others, it should be as detailed as possible.

Question 97
Skipped
The products which are going to be produced as a result of the project will be used in three different countries. During a meeting, the customer and the contractor have been agreed to provide value to the customer as early as possible; but the contractor will have to consider the cultural differences between these countries when delivering the products to these countries. They are also agreed on getting professional help from local advisors when delivering the produced products. Now they are talking about which approach to use.

The contractor should:

Correct answer
A) Use an agile approach to deliver the product incrementally

B) Discuss with the local advisors about which approach they should use

C) Let the customer choose the best approach

D) Hold another meeting with the customer and local advisors to determine the best approach

Overall explanation
The question seems too long but the only information we need is given in a single sentence; it says “the customer and the contractor have been agreed to provide value to the customer as early as possible”. Since an agile approach will satisfy this statement, they will use an agile approach to deliver the product incrementally.

Question 98
Skipped
Fill in the blanks: The projects start in order to …………………... The project manager needs to manage the project by considering ………………….. because ………………….. is one of the most important objectives of executing the project.

A) First Blank: make a profit; Second Blank: completing the project with the lowest cost; Third Blank: earning money

B) First Blank: satisfy the customer requirements; Second Blank: the customer requirements; Third Blank: customer satisfaction

C) First Blank: satisfy the customer requirements; Second Blank: completing the project with the lowest cost too; Third Blank: making a profit

Correct answer
D) First Blank: provide business value; Second Blank: the business value; Third Blank: providing value

Overall explanation
First of all, all the options are correct. The customer requirements, customer satisfaction, making a profit, earning money, and completing the project with the lowest cost are important objectives for a project. But since we are looking for the best option, ‘providing business value’ covers all of these and more, and therefore option D is better than other options.

Question 99
Skipped

Question 100
Skipped
What is the primary purpose of preparing the staff release plan?

Correct answer
A) Saving money and improving staff’s morale

B) Helping people to manage their time easier

C) Preventing possible lawsuits from team members

D) Helping the project schedule to meet deadlines

Overall explanation
The primary purpose of preparing a staff release plan is to save money by releasing people on time. It will also improve the project staff’s morale because after preparing this plan, everybody knows when he/she is going to be released.

Question 101
Skipped
The project is completed today. If you make EVM calculations right now, what would you calculate the schedule variance?

A) Equals to 1

Correct answer
B) Equals to 0

C) Equals to EV (Earned Value)

D) Equals to PV (Planned Value)

Overall explanation
Schedule Variance (SV) = Earned Value (EV) – Planned Value (PV).  At the end of the project, EV will be equal to PV because every planned value will be earned. Therefore SV will be 0 then.

Question 102
Skipped
Risk analyses are generally divided into two groups by the analysis type: Quantitative Risk Analysis and Qualitative Risk Analysis. Qualitative Risk Analysis should be applied to what kind of risks?

Correct answer
A) All risks listed in the risk register

B) All risks listed in the prioritized risks

C) Risks that are determined by high-level management

D) Risks which are determined by the customer

Overall explanation
Qualitative Risk Analysis is conducted for all risks listed in the risk register. Then these risks are ranked and the prioritized risks are determined. After that, quantitative risk analysis is conducted for these prioritized risks.

Question 103
Skipped
A PMP certified project manager, who is also your best friend, went on a vacation for four weeks. Now, you are deputizing his position. You observed that some stakeholders had been forgotten during the preparation of the stakeholder list and these stakeholders had caused a few changes in the scope. These changes had been applied without passing through the formal change management process. What should you do?

A) Inform the project manager about the situation since he is responsible for the project

B) Do nothing since you are a temporary project manager

C) Apply formal change management process for all past unauthorized changes

Correct answer
D) Inform the sponsor and the stakeholders that the scope is changed and the proper change management process had not been followed

Overall explanation
You should report all of the improprieties to the appropriate management. Observing an unauthorized action but doing nothing is not allowed. Informing the sponsor and the stakeholders about the unauthorized scope change will be the best action in this situation.
Question 104
Skipped
While doing earned value calculations you found the values of PV, AC, and EV. You calculated EV / AC value as 1.15. In this case, do you need any corrective action?

A) Yes, this ratio is called «Cost Variance» and if it is greater than 1, then you are behind the budget

B) No, this ratio is called «Cost Variance» and if it is greater than 1 then you are ahead of the budget

C) Yes, this ratio is called «Cost Performance Index» and if it is greater than 1 then you are behind the budget

Correct answer
D) No, this ratio is called «Cost Performance Index» and if it is greater than 1 then you are ahead of the budget

Overall explanation
This ratio is called the «Cost Performance Index» and if it is greater than 1 then you are ahead of the budget. Therefore, you don’t need any corrective action.

Question 105
Skipped
You are the project manager of an ongoing project. You are about to have a meeting with executive management. You have prepared lots of documents and a presentation for this meeting. While you are walking to the meeting room, a team member calls you and says: «One of our key resources has just left the project.» You are not sure if you can find another resource immediately for this position or not. If you cannot find any alternatives, most probably your project will be delayed. You asked the team member to search for alternatives immediately and call you back about the results. Then what would you do next in this situation?

A) Postpone the meeting until you find an alternative resource

B) Postpone the meeting until you understand if you can or cannot find any alternative resource

C) Attend the meeting and wait for the team member’s call to tell the situation to executive management

Correct answer
D) Attend the meeting and tell executive management the situation exactly as you know now

Overall explanation
If you learn about a new risk then you need to disclose it as soon as possible, this is because of the code of ethics. Therefore, in this situation, it is better to attend the meeting and tell executive management the situation exactly as you know at the moment.

Question 106
Skipped
You are about to determine the budget for your project. You have the cost management plan, scope baseline, cost estimates, basis of estimates, and project schedule with you. You want to make a list of other things to have. Which of the following options will not be on this list?

A) Risk register

Correct answer
B) Project funding requirements

C) Agreements

D) Organizational process assets

Overall explanation

Question 107
Skipped


At the end of the 12th iteration, the project team created the velocity tracking chart as seen above. They will make a prediction on when they could complete the project and to make the prediction, they will use the past performance data.

Which data set should they use for their calculations?

(ps. In the real exam, you will be clicking on the graph to choose the best answer.)

A) A

B) B

Correct answer
C) C

D) D

Overall explanation
Generally, during the first few iterations, the performance of the team may not be stable. As it is seen on the graph, the average of the first four iterations is so much less than the rest of the graph. To make a prediction on when to complete the project, the project team should not use the data of these first iterations. In other words, they should use all the data except the first four iterations.

Question 108
Skipped
You need a detailed list and description of specific assumptions for your project. Where can you find this information?

Correct answer
A) Project scope statement

Question 110
Skipped
The project team has been agreed on using the scrum framework for their project. They are also agreed on team augmentation with the customer. The team consists of 12 team members totally; 7 of these members will be working as a co-located team and the rest of the team will work as dispersed teams.

Choose the best communication types the following stakeholders should prefer first when communicating with each other.

I: In between the co-located team members

II: Between co-located team and customer’s team

III: Between dispersed team members and the co-located team

A) I: email; II: face-to-face; III: chat app

B) I: face-to-face; II: face-to-face; III: face-to-face

Correct answer
C) I: face-to-face; II: face-to-face; III: chat app

D) I: face-to-face; II: email; III: chat app

E) I: chat app; II: email; III: chat app

F) I: email; II: email; III: email

Overall explanation
We always prefer face-to-face conversations between co-located team members. Since we are agreed on team augmentation with the customer, we will be working in the same place with the customer’s team; therefore, we will again prefer face-to-face conversation. Finally, since we can’t communicate with dispersed team members face-to-face, we can communicate via chat app instead.

Question 111
Skipped
There is a very uncertain environment and the project team is dealing with a high number of risks.

What should the project team use to manage risks in such an environment?

(Choose the best three options)

A) Risk management plan

B) Velocity chart

Correct selection
C) Risk-based spike

Correct selection
D) Risk-adjusted backlog

E) Key performance indicators

Correct selection
F) Risk burndown chart

Overall explanation
Since it is a very uncertain environment, the project team will use an agile approach. In agile projects, we don’t need to document the management plans as we do in predictive projects. Therefore, instead of creating a risk management plan, we will be using agile tools like a risk-based spike, risk-adjusted backlog, and risk burndown chart.

Question 112
Skipped

A) Analogous estimating

B) Rough cost estimating

C) Top-down estimating

Correct answer
D) Bottom-up estimating

Overall explanation
Since you have limited information about the scope, you cannot use a detailed estimating technique. The bottom-up estimating technique is used for making detailed and precise cost estimations.
Question 113
Skipped
During the project, you had some problems with the seller of a specific work package. Which of the following options may help you for documenting this experience for your future projects?

A) Records management system

B) Change requests

Question 114
Skipped
It is the middle of the software development project. Due to the very uncertain environment, it is very hard to make budgetary estimations; although this is the case, the higher management requested a revised budgetary estimation.

What information or tool the project manager needs in order to make the budgetary estimation?

(Choose the best two options)

A) Cost management plan

Correct selection
B) Burnup chart

C) Sprint backlog

D) Release plan

Correct selection
E) Actual cost data

Overall explanation
Since this is a software development project and there is a very uncertain environment, we can say, the project is applying an agile approach. To make a budgetary estimation in such an agile environment, the project manager needs to see the actual cost spent up to that moment, and the trend this cost has been spent (remember the EVM calculations in agile environments). For this reason, the actual cost data and the burnup chart will be helpful.

Question 115
Skipped
There are four different software development projects which are ongoing throughout the organization. A story which can be called Story B exists in all of these projects. Although the story point of this story is very close to each other in three of the projects, in Project Y, the story point for this story is so much different than other projects. Project Y's project manager has been asked for the reason for this difference.

How should the project manager answer this question?

Correct answer
A) There is nothing to worry about because this is just how my team has decided the story point for this story

B) Let me check what the problem is; I will turn back to you whenever I find the root cause

C) Let’s hold a meeting with other projects’ project managers and discuss this issue

D) Determination of story points is a theoretical concept, for this reason, they can be different than each other; there is nothing to worry about

Overall explanation
Story points are estimated by the project team, by comparing the Stories of the project to each other by considering the complexity, risks, and amount of work to be done; in other words, the Story Point estimation is done on a relative scale. For this reason, there is nothing to worry about because this is just how the project team of Project Y has decided. If you have chosen D, please note that, although the story point estimation is done on a relative scale, we can’t say that this is just a theoretical concept.

Question 116
Skipped
The client was used to work in predictive environments for years, but the contractor convinced them to use an agile approach for this project they just signed the contract for. Although this is the case, the client still has concerns about agile environments. It has been only 3 days since the contract has signed, and the contractor’s team physically started working on the project. The client thinks the contractor did not spend enough time on planning and based on their past experience this may cause the project to fail. They asked the project manager about this.

How should the project manager answer this question?

A) In agile projects, the project team does not spend time on planning; they start the project work immediately to complete the project as soon as they can

B) Agile approaches are not about planning, they are about delivering value as soon as possible; don't worry, we will provide you value faster

C) Although my team started working on the project, another team is still working on developing a detailed plan; don't worry, we will deliver that plan soon

Correct answer
D) All we need is just enough planning in agile projects; this provides us to overcome such uncertain environments

Overall explanation
In agile projects, there is an uncertain environment; because of this reason, it is almost impossible to develop a detailed plan at the beginning of the project. Although this is the case, planning is still important; just enough planning is enough to start the project.

Question 117
Skipped
You are a team member of a large project. You want to search for the escalation process documents which are about resolving the issues that can’t be resolved by the lower-level staff. You should search for which of the following plans?

A) Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Correct answer
B) Communication Management Plan

C) Risk Management Plan

D) Procurement Management Plan

Overall explanation
The escalation process is documented in the communication management plan, therefore, you should be looking at the communication management plan.

Question 118
Skipped
You are about to develop the stakeholder register for your project. You need the document showing the external and internal parties involved in the project. This document is:

A) Project’s scope of work

B) Project plan

C) Stakeholder engagement plan

Correct answer
D) Project charter

Overall explanation
Develop stakeholder register is an output of Identify Stakeholders process. Therefore, the question is asking for an input to this process that documents the external and internal parties involved in the project. Project Charter should be the answer then.

Question 119
Skipped
You have calculated the total number of communication channels to be 10. What is the number of stakeholders of this project then?

A) 45

B) 10

Correct answer
C) 5

D) 4

Overall explanation
Total number of communication channels = n x (n-1) / 2. Since the number of stakeholders should be less than the number of communication channels, 45 or 10 will not be the answer. There are two options left: 5 and 4. Let’s do the calculation for both numbers.  If n=5; Total number of communication channels = (5 x 4) / 2 = 10.  If n=4; Total number of communication channels = (4 x 3) / 2 = 6.  Therefore the best answer is 5.

Question 120
Skipped
You are the project manager for a construction project. You find out that a team member has been stealing some material from the construction site. You are extremely sad because he was one of your favorite team members. What should you do?

A) Since he is your favorite staff, keep quiet until it repeats for a second time

B) Tell him if he repeats such an activity again, you will take disciplinary action

Correct answer
C) Inform the Human Resources department about the matter

D) Document it for your future projects

Overall explanation
This activity requires disciplinary action. You should inform the human resources department about the matter and they should take disciplinary action.

Question 121
Skipped
The team used to work in predictive environments. This year, to comply with the new company policies, they will start applying agile approaches. One of the team members asked the project manager about how they should inform others about the project's progress.

Which tools can be used for this purpose?

(Choose the best three options)

A) Kanban board

Correct selection
B) Cumulative Flow Diagram

C) Velocity burnup matrix

Correct selection
D) Information radiator

Correct selection
E) Feature chart

F) Planning poker

Overall explanation
To inform others about the project progress the cumulative flow diagram, information radiator, and feature chart can be used. Although we can see which stories are completed on the Kanban board, we don’t have the estimation for the total number of stories; therefore, options B, D, and E are better options than A. Planning poker is a technique that is used for determining story points, and there is no such thing as a ‘Velocity burnup matrix’.

Question 122
Skipped
One of the resources was expected to start Project A tomorrow. This resource is working on another project within the organization, Project B, and since there is a delay in that project, he will not be able to start in Project A tomorrow. This will cause a project delay in Project A.

What should the project manager have done to prevent the delay?

A) Checked the stakeholder register and updated it regularly

B) Refined the backlog by considering this resource’s availability

Correct answer
C) Worked in coordination with Project B’s project manager

D) Checked the stakeholder’s availability in the information radiator

Overall explanation
Since the resource is currently working on another project, the project manager should have worked in coordination with Project B’s project manager so that he could be aware of the availability of the resource before.

Question 123
Skipped
In predictive environments, the project team can plan how to manage and satisfy the desired quality at the very beginning of the project; then they can manage quality by considering these detailed plans. But in Agile environments, they can’t create detailed plans to ensure quality.

Which of the following options cannot be helpful to ensure desired quality in agile environments?

A) Iterations

B) Kanban

C) Retrospectives

Correct answer
D) Burndown charts

Overall explanation
Iterations provide early feedback that can help the project team to deliver higher quality products. By limiting the maximum number of works in progress, Kanban can be helpful to ensure quality, too. In retrospective meetings, they discuss the quality of the processes they followed, therefore, retrospectives can also be helpful to ensure the desired quality. Burndown charts cannot be used for ensuring desired quality.

Question 124
Skipped
You are the project manager of a large dam project. To start the construction work, you need to get an environmental permit. You have received a reliable report indicating this project will have serious negative effects on the environment. Your boss says: "It is better to keep quiet at this stage. Bribing in this country is almost a legal action and I will do whatever I can do to solve this issue." What should you do?

A) Since you need to follow your boss’s instructions, keep quiet about the matter

B) Send an e-mail to your boss to disown the ownership of the project

C) Do nothing, your boss is responsible for this issue; let him solve the problem by himself

Correct answer
D) Inform the necessary authorities about the issue

Overall explanation
Due to the code of ethics, it is better to inform the necessary authorities of the issue even this means the project will be canceled.

Question 125
Skipped
Business Case influences the creation of the project charter. Which of the following is included in the Business Case?

A) Work breakdown structure

B) SV and CV of the project

Correct answer
C) Cost-benefit analysis

D) EVM analysis

Overall explanation
The cost-benefit analysis is included in the Business Case of the project.

Question 126
Skipped
You just calculated the degree of a scope variation of your project. What should you do next?

A) Update the lessons learned documents

B) Re-plan your project according to the variation

Correct answer
C) Do the root cause analysis of the cause of the variation

D) Close project or phase

Overall explanation
Once you discover and calculate the degree of the scope variation, it is better to find the root cause of the variation to solve the problem permanently.

Question 127
Skipped
You want to subcontract a specific work package immediately, but the scope is not clear yet. You decided to sign a contract to determine the unit rates for each activity. Which of the following contract types is more suitable in this case?

A) Cost plus incentive fee

B) Cost reimbursable

Correct answer
C) Time and material

D) Fixed price award fee

Overall explanation
Time and material (or in other words, unit price) type of contract is more suitable in this situation. Since the scope is unknown, the contract will be open-ended but a consensus will be achieved at unit prices of the activities.
Question 128
Skipped
You are about to quantify and classify the problems according to sources. Which of the following options may help you in this case?

Correct answer
A) Pareto diagram

B) Control chart

C) Ishikawa diagram

D) Resource histogram

Overall explanation
A Pareto diagram can be used to quantify and classify the problems according to sources. It is a useful technique to understand the most affecting area of the problems.

Question 129
Skipped
According to the Tuckman Ladder Model, there are five stages of team establishment and development; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.

A coding error caught in which of these stages will cause the most serious effect to the project?

A) Forming

B) Storming

C) Norming

Correct answer
D) Performing

Overall explanation
As you would remember from the lectures, there is a concept known as “fast failure”. According to this concept, if you catch the failure fast, it will cost you less. Or in other words, if you catch the failure later, it will have more negative effects. Among the options, since the “Performing” stage indicates a later time compared to other stages, a coding error caught in the performing stage will cause the most serious effect on the project.

Question 130
Skipped
As a PMP certified project manager, you are managing an IT project. Due to the contract between your company and the customer company, if you complete the work by the end of this year, your company will get a $200,000 bonus. Today, you entered the actual progress, did the CPM calculations, and found out that the work will be completed 3 weeks after the end of this year. But your manager is insisting you complete the work by the end of this year. What should you do?

A) Tell your manager that completing the work until the end of this year is almost impossible

B) Fast track the project

Correct answer
C) Explain the impacts of the schedule changes on the project to your manager and other stakeholders

D) Compress the schedule

Overall explanation
You need to explain the impacts of the schedule changes on the project to your manager and other stakeholders first. After that, you will explore the options to go forward with the change.
Question 131
Skipped
The customer is used to work in predictive environments but for this project, they are agreed with the contractor to apply an agile approach for the first time. The customer sent an email to the project manager and asked for a plan in which they can see the major deliverables.

How should the project manager reply to this request?

A) Sorry, we can’t send you such a document; in agile projects, we don’t have any plans to satisfy your request

B) You can find this information on the Kanban board; please check the information radiator

Correct answer
C) Please kindly find the product roadmap attached to this email

D) You can find this information in the attached product backlog, please check

Overall explanation
The major deliverables can be found in the product roadmap; therefore, the project manager can send this document to the customer.

Question 132
Skipped
Your company has changed its vision and determined new strategies for this new vision. Your project, having a 10% physical progress, will be shut down because of this new strategy. Which of the following processes should follow this activity?

A) Perform integrated change control

Correct answer
B) Validate scope

C) Monitor Communications

D) Close project or phase

Overall explanation
Since the project will be terminated, you will need to close it, but to be able to close the Project, the scope should be validated first.

Question 133
Skipped
In a contract, you can find lots of information about the project. The contractual provisions written in a contract are:

A) Deliverables

Correct answer
B) Constraints

C) Risks

D) Scope

Overall explanation
Contractual provisions are limiting factors for the project. Therefore, they are constraints for the project.

Question 134
Skipped
You are assigned as the project manager of a low-profile project of the company. For a work package, you need an engineer having special knowledge about that work. There is only one engineer in the company with this capability. The functional manager of this engineer may not be very happy giving him to your project because your project is a low profiled project. Which of the following techniques can be helpful in this situation?

Correct answer
A) Negotiation

B) Acquisition

C) Punishment

D) Rewarding

Overall explanation
No matter if your project is a low profiled project or not, you may always face this situation. The best action, in this case, is the negotiation. You can negotiate not only with the functional managers but also with other project management teams.

Question 135
Skipped
Fill in the blank: …………………… is a technique used for estimating story points of stories in the product backlog.

A) Fibonacci Sequence

Correct answer
B) Planning Poker

C) Daily Scrum

D) Architectural Spike

Overall explanation
Planning Poker is a technique used for estimating story points of stories in the product backlog. Please note that the Fibonacci Sequence is a ‘scaling system’, not a technique.

Question 136
Skipped
The project is started six months ago and the product owner still continuously searching for the market for the new similar products recently released by other companies. Based on her findings, she decided to add three new features to the backlog; these new features are very critical for producing a competitive product. She thinks it will take 4 weeks for these new features to be completed.

The customer is asking if adding these new features will affect the project deadline or any other parts of the project. How should the product owner answer this question?

A) To answer this question, we need to wait for the change control board to evaluate the effects of this change on the project

Correct answer
B) The project deadline will not be affected but some of the least important features may not be released

C) This change will cause a 4-week delay

D) I believe this change will cause a 4-week delay but I can give you a better estimation after my team updates the project schedule

Overall explanation
As you will remember from the lectures, we have three major constraints in projects: scope, budget, and time. In agile projects, time and budget are fixed but the scope can be changed. Therefore, we can change the scope to complete the project on time. The best way to change the scope in such a situation is, not to release the least important features. Option B is the best option then.

Question 137
Skipped
A new project is about to start. You are assigned to be the project manager of this new project. The project charter has been approved and all stakeholders are identified. Now, you should:

A) Create Work Breakdown Structure of the project

B) Create Work Breakdown Dictionary of the project

C) Determine all activities and create the activity list

Correct answer
D) Determine your roadmap for creating the project plan

Overall explanation
Since the project charter is approved and all the stakeholders are identified, initiating the project is just completed. Planning is the next stage and you should first determine your roadmap or in other words, you should determine “how you will create the project plan”.

Question 138
Skipped
It is the middle of the project and one of the user stories needs to be changed.

What should the project manager do?

A) Create a change request and apply the change after it is approved by the change control board

B) Change the story in the backlog; there is no need to create any change requests

C) Ask the team if they really need to change the story

Correct answer
D) Remove the impediments to make the process more efficient

Overall explanation
In agile projects, we don’t create any change requests to make changes in the scope; if it is needed, the story can be changed without creating any change request. But it is the product owner, not the project manager, who can make a change in the backlog. The project manager’s role includes removing the impediments to make the process more efficient; therefore, the best answer is D.

Question 139
Skipped
In extremely uncertain environments, what should the project manager do to prevent changes in scope?

A) Follow exactly what is explained in the change management plan

B) Encourage everyone to create a change request if a change is needed

C) Ensure the scope baseline can easily be seen by everyone; if the stakeholders know the scope very well, the number of changes could decrease

Correct answer
D) The project manager should not try to prevent changes in such environments

Overall explanation
If it is an extremely uncertain environment, this is an agile project we are talking about. As you will remember from the lecture, in agile projects, change is our friend; therefore, the project manager will not try to prevent changes in such an environment.

Question 140
Skipped
The buyer and the seller are negotiating the contract they will sign. They are agreed on using an agile approach. Since currently, the scope is not clear, the buyer requests to sign a contract that will provide flexibility to add or remove features to the product in the future. Which of the following options can be helpful for this purpose?

A) Sign a time and materials contract

Correct answer
B) Add a dynamic scope clause to the contract

C) Add an early cancellation clause to the contract

D) Sign a fixed price contract

Overall explanation
If they add a dynamic scope clause to the contract, the buyer can add and remove stories to the backlog without changing the size of the work package. This clause gives the buyer flexibility to add or remove features to the product in the future.

Question 141
Skipped
“Construction of the 2nd floor can only start after completing the construction of the 1st floor because it is impossible to start next floor’s construction without completing the previous floor’s construction.” This sentence is an example of which of the following dependencies?

Correct answer
A) Hard Logic

B) Discretionary Dependency

C) External Dependency

D) Soft Logic 

Overall explanation
Since it is impossible to start the activity without completing the previous one, this is a hard logic (or in other words “mandatory dependency”).

Question 142
Skipped
You are about to make a decision on the type of material for a specific work package. There are two options. Buying the first material will cost $100,000 and buying the second material will cost $120,000. Since it is cheaper, you decided to use the first material. 10 months later, the project ends and the end-product of the project is produced. Your company notices that the maintenance cost of the selected material is $15,000 each year. If the second material had been chosen instead of the first material, the maintenance cost would be $5,000 each year. Because of this decision, your company will have to pay $100,000 more in ten years. Which of the following is the main reason for the company to pay more?

A) Value analysis is not done

Correct answer
B) Life cycle costing is missed

C) Cost of quality is not considered

D) Bottom-up estimating is not done

Overall explanation
Life cycle costing considers not only the project costs but also the whole life cost of the product. Since it is missed, your company will have to pay $100,000 more because of this wrong decision.

Question 143
Skipped
Michelle has completed the performance calculations and she obtained the following results:

CPI=0.85; SPI=0.90;

If the Budget at Completion is $500,000, which of the following statements is wrong?

A) The project should be accelerated to complete the work on time

B) TCPI value is greater than 1

Correct answer
C) ETC value is less than 0

D) The project is over budget

Overall explanation
Since the SPI is less than 1, the project is behind the schedule and it should be accelerated. Since CPI is less than 1, the project is over budget and the TCPI value is greater than 1. ETC is the Estimate To Complete value and it is the money required to complete the remaining work; it cannot be less than 0.

Question 144
Skipped
You have subcontracted a work package by signing a fixed price contract. Which of the following does not explain why you have preferred a fixed price contract?

A) The scope is detailed and clear

B) Seller will try to work more carefully because every extra cost of him will decrease his profit

Correct answer
C) Risk of the seller is minimized

D) Risk of the buyer is minimized

Overall explanation
The risk of the buyer (not the seller!) is minimized if it is a fixed price type of contract.

Question 145
Skipped
The buyer and the seller will sign a graduated fixed price contract. The buyer wants to decrease the cost risk.

How can the buyer decrease the cost risk?

Correct answer
A) By adding a not-to-exceed clause to the contract

B) By creating a detailed risk management plan

C) By providing a single statement of work

D) By updating the risk register by considering the cost risk

Overall explanation
The buyer can limit the overall project cost by adding a not-to-exceed clause to the contract; limiting the overall cost will decrease the cost risk for the buyer.

Question 146
Skipped
Three scrum artifacts, the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and the increments:

Correct answer
A) Provide transparency for inspection and adaptation purposes

B) Ensure the development team to be self-organized

C) Ensure the project costs to be effectively managed

D) Ensure the team members to be dedicated to the project

Overall explanation
Three scrum artifacts, the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and the increments, provide transparency for inspection and adaptation purposes.

Question 147
Skipped
At the end of the project, the total cost is agreed to be above the Point of Total Assumption. What may be the main reason for this result and who is responsible for this situation?

A) The ceiling price is low; the buyer is responsible for this situation

B) Target fee is low; the buyer is responsible for this situation

C) Because of mismanagement; the Project manager of the buyer is responsible for this situation

Correct answer
D) Because of mismanagement; the Project manager of the seller is responsible for this situation

Overall explanation
Costs above the point of total assumption are assumed to be due to mismanagement. The project manager of the seller is responsible for this situation.

Question 148
Skipped

The chart given above represents Project A’s status based on the Stacy Model. Which of the following options is not true for Project A?

A) Project A is considered to be a highly risky project

Correct answer
B) Since the technology is not clear, the team needs to develop well-described management plans

C) Although the technology is unclear, Kanban can be used in Project A

D) They need to have cross-functional teams to manage Project A

Overall explanation
According to the Stacy Model, this project is considered to be a complex project. In such projects, the risk is considered to be moderate to high and an adaptive approach is more suitable. In adaptive projects, they need to have cross-functional teams to manage the project and Kanban can be used, too. But well-described management plans are developed in predictive projects, not in agile projects. For this reason, the best answer is B.

Question 149
Skipped
The organization used to execute predictive projects but the new organizational vision requires them to start applying agile approaches.

Which of the following strategies is not suitable for this organization?

Correct answer
A) Determining one of the critical projects as the pilot project and applying the desired agile approach to this pilot project first

B) Encouraging team members to solve the problems on their own

C) Transiting from predictive to agile gradually

D) Using a hybrid life cycle having combined predictive and agile approaches

Overall explanation
When transiting from a predictive environment to an adaptive environment, it might be a good idea to determine a pilot project first and apply the desired agile approach to this pilot project. But determining a critical project as a pilot project is not a good strategy because if anything gets wrong in the pilot project, its effects could be huge (because it is critical!). For this reason, the best answer is A. All other options can be applied as a transitioning strategy.

Question 150
Skipped
Which of the following statements about incremental and iterative life cycles is wrong?

A) The requirements are dynamic for both life cycles

B) The number of changes is higher in the incremental life cycle

C) In iterative, processes follow spiral steps, and feedback for the unfinished deliverable is allowed

Correct answer
D) In iterative, the project team plans the project as much as they know at the beginning but in incremental, they only plan for the following iteration in detail

Overall explanation
In iterative, the project team plans the project as much as they know at the beginning, this is correct. But in incremental, the project team plans the project as much as they know and they make changes to the plans as they move forward. If the project team plans only for the following iteration in detail, then this is an agile life cycle, not an incremental life cycle. For this reason, the best answer is D and all other options are true.

Question 151
Skipped
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which of the following options is the highest level of motivation?

Correct answer
A) Self-actualization

B) Esteem

Skipped
Fill in the blank: ………………………. provides the project team with policies, processes, decision-making models and tools to administer the project.

A) Organizational project management

Correct answer
B) Project governance

C) Organizational governance

D) The product roadmap

Overall explanation
Organizational Project Management (OPM) provides organizational level guidance on project, program, portfolio management, and other organizational practices; it is the framework itself. (Project Management Office (PMO) staff use this framework to achieve their project management goals.) Organizational governance is the overall structure of an organization; it provides policies and procedures to achieve organizational strategic goals. Project Governance provides the project team with project-level policies, processes, decision-making models, and tools to administer the project. (The Project Management Office may provide and execute the Project Governance.)

Question 153
Skipped
The feasibility work of a project is just over. What is next?

A) The project charter should be created

B) The product manager needs to create the product backlog

C) The development team should plan for the first iteration

Correct answer
D) They should act by considering the phase gate results

Overall explanation
The feasibility work represents a project phase. Since it is just over, they need to evaluate the results they got from this phase. We call this evaluation stage the “Phase Gate”. They should act by considering the phase gate results (ie. they will decide to continue or not to continue with the next phase.)

Question 154
Skipped
You are the project manager of an industrial construction project. You will subcontract a specific work package of the project. This is the final step and you are about to select the seller.

The following table is given to you by your management team:


Which seller should you select?

A) Since the price of Seller X has the best rating, Seller X should be selected

B) Since the total score of Seller Z is the best, Seller Z should be selected

Correct answer
C) Selection should be done according to the buyer company’s seller selection criteria

D) More information is needed to answer the question

Overall explanation
It seems like Seller Z, which is the company with the highest total score, has the advantage among others, but you should not select the seller company by only looking at this table. Selection should be done according to the buyer company’s seller selection criteria.

Question 155
Skipped
Which of the following options is true about just-in-time environments?

A) Since it is a just in time environment, no schedule is needed

B) Since it is a just in time environment, no project management plan is needed

Correct answer
C) Since it is a just in time environment, no inventory is needed

D) Since it is a just in time environment, events are mutually exclusive

Overall explanation
Generally, no inventory is needed in a just-in-time environment. Most of the materials are provided by subcontractors immediately by the time it is needed.

Question 156
Skipped
In the morning, the team members got together to talk about what they did yesterday and what they plan to do today. One of the team members talked about an issue that has to be fixed immediately. But to fix the issue immediately, he needs other team members’ help. If this issue cannot be solved immediately, it may cause a project delay.

What should they do?

A) They need to create a change request and apply the change if the change request is approved by the change control board

B) They need to find and investigate the root cause of the problem

Correct answer
C) They need to hold another meeting and discuss how to solve the issue in that meeting

D) Since this issue has to be solved immediately, they need to discuss the solution right away

Overall explanation
In the question, it says ‘the team members got together to talk about what they did yesterday and what they plan to do today’; therefore, this is a daily scrum meeting (or daily standup meeting). In daily scrum, the team members can talk about the issues but they don’t try to solve these issues in the meeting; they hold another meeting to discuss how to solve the issue. For this reason, the best answer is C.

Question 157
Skipped
The agile team had an issue and by trying to solve this issue, they learned lots of different things about how to improve the processes. Now they want to share this experience with others within the organization; this might have positive impacts on other projects within the organization. Which of the following tools can be used for this purpose?

(Choose the best two answers)

A) Impact mapping

Correct selection
B) Retrospective findings

Correct selection
C) Information radiator

D) Daily meetings

Overall explanation
The team can add the lessons they learned to the retrospective findings and they can use the information radiator to share these findings. Daily meetings can be helpful to share information within the team, but since we are looking for tools that can be helpful to share the experience with other stakeholders within the organization, daily meetings cannot be helpful for this purpose.

Question 158
Skipped
In agile projects, sharing knowledge with other stakeholders increases the chance of being successful for current and future projects. Which of the following options cannot be helpful to transfer knowledge?

A) Retrospective findings

B) Kanban board

C) Daily meetings

Correct answer
D) Communications management plan

Overall explanation
We don’t create management plans in agile projects. All other options can be helpful to transfer knowledge.

Question 159
Skipped
Retrospective meetings are very crucial events in agile projects. Which of the following options is not true about these meetings?

Correct answer
A) Following iteration is planned during this meeting

B) Retrospective meetings can be helpful for knowledge transfer

C) During this meeting the team discusses how they did with the previous iteration

D) Retrospective findings are updated as a result of these meetings

Overall explanation
During retrospective meetings, the team discusses how they did with the previous iteration. Newly learned lessons are added to the retrospective findings, therefore, retrospective findings are updated as a result of these meetings. Retrospectives can also be helpful for knowledge transfer, too. But the following iteration is not planned during this meeting.

A project which is in trouble has an initial budget of $200,000. Only 50% of the project is completed and $350,000 has already been spent. SPI is 1.85. To decide whether to continue with this project or start another project, you know that sunk cost should not be considered. What is the sunk cost for this troubled project?

A) $150,000

Correct answer
B) $350,000

C) $700,000

D) $0

Overall explanation
You don’t need to do any calculations. The sunk cost is the Actual Cost spent to date. Since until now, $350,000 is spent, the sunk cost is $350,000.

Question 161
Skipped
Organizational process assets are the main inputs to the “Manage Stakeholder Engagement Process”. Which of the following options is not a key organizational process asset utilized during this process?

A) Historical information about previous projects

B) Organizational communication requirements

Correct answer
C) Project document templates

D) Change control procedures

Overall explanation
All of the options are organizational process assets. Project document templates are more relevant during the planning phase. Since the “Manage Stakeholder Engagement Process” is an executing process, “Project document templates” is not a key organizational process asset for this process.

Question 162
Skipped
You are the project manager of a software development project. You are about to estimate the duration of each activity. The engineer responsible for Activity A has not been hired yet. You know from the past projects that completing this activity will most probably take 12 days. In one of the projects that you worked on before, it took 18 days for a similar activity to complete. But you know that this is an exception. One of your team members says: "If everything goes perfectly OK, this activity can be completed in 8 days". Your sponsor enforces you to use the simple distribution. What should be the duration estimation for this activity?

Correct answer
A) 12.67 days

B) 12.33 days

C) 15.33 days

D) 12 days

Overall explanation
P=18 days; M=12 days; O=8 days Expected Activity Duration = (P + M + O) / 3 = (18 + 12 + 8) / 3 = 12.67

A) Sprint review

B) Daily scrum

Correct answer
C) Sprint retrospective

D) Backlog grooming

Overall explanation
We know that in agile projects, some working parts of the final deliverable are released at the end of the iterations. Since we are producing something new at the end of the iteration, and since each iteration has a beginning and an end, we can consider these iterations as 'mini-projects'. From this point of view, a Retrospective can be considered as the close-out meeting for these 'mini-projects'; after we complete a mini-project, we close it with a retrospective meeting and start the next mini-project (ie. the next iteration); this is how we do the project closure in an agile way.

Question 164
Skipped
Right after following the testing procedures, a critical issue has found in the software the team has been developing. There are several different reasons for the problem and they need to be solved quickly. Six key stakeholders need to be informed about the issue. Which of the following options is the best way to inform these stakeholders about the problem and its solutions?

Correct answer
A) Holding a meeting in the meeting room to discuss the issue

B) Sending an email explaining the issue and the solutions

C) Talking to each stakeholder one by one about the issue

D) Attaching the test results to the information radiator and asking stakeholders to take a look at them

Overall explanation
Since there are several reasons for the problem and they need to be solved quickly, we need to prefer a rich conversation type so that we can provide a lot of information in a shorter time. Therefore, a face-to-face conversation is the best for this situation. Since there are six stakeholders to be informed of, talking to each of them one by one would take considerable time. For this reason, holding a meeting in the meeting room to discuss the issue is the best action in this situation.

Question 165
Skipped
As a PMP certified project manager, you are assigned to an ongoing project. The ex-project manager of the same project is your friend and he told you: "I don't know why, but there are lots of problems with the budget." To find the root cause of the problem, you start to examine the budget. There are 3 estimations made for each activity: pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely. Estimations are done by team members. Among the estimations, the most likely estimation is assumed to be the cost of the activity. Then it is used while calculating the budget. If the CPI is 1.24 and SPI is 0.98, which of the following options best describes the problem with the budget?

A) Estimations should not be made by team members. It is the project manager’s responsibility. Since team members don’t know the project management concepts, they probably make mistakes while estimating.

B) To stay on the safe side, the pessimistic estimation should be used instead of the most likely estimation.

C) Since CPI is 1.24, everything is fine. You don’t need to worry about the budget.

Correct answer
D) Three-point estimating is not made properly and this should be the main reason for the problems.

Overall explanation
Pessimistic, Optimistic, and Most Likely estimations are done, but the expected activity cost is not calculated. Instead of the most likely estimation, expected activity cost should be used for each activity.

Question 166
Skipped
Being the manager responsible for the budget, you are preparing the budget for a new hospital project. The project is new and all information you have is: "It is going to be almost similar to another hospital project." Since you don’t have any other information, you decide to use the cost data of that project directly. This is an example of which of the following?

A) Parametric Estimating

B) Monte Carlo Simulation

C) Three Point Estimating

Correct answer
D) Analogous Estimating

Overall explanation
Since you use the data of a similar project directly, this is an analogous estimating example.
Question 167
Skipped
The project team is developing an application for the government. The application consists of nine modules and the team has already delivered two of these modules. Today, the project manager learned that there might be a compliance issue with one of the remaining modules.

The project manager should review which document first?

Correct answer
A) Project charter

B) Business case

C) Product backlog

D) Product roadmap

Overall explanation
In the question, we understand that some parts of our Project may not be compliant with some regulation, law, or some other requirement. We can find high-level requirements in the Project Charter and these high-level requirements will also include the compliance requirements, too; therefore, the project manager needs to review the project charter first.

Question 168
Skipped
The projects conducted within the organization are extremely complex projects. These projects have hundreds of different compliance requirements to meet and these requirements are related to different teams within the projects. The project management office will work with an expert to determine how they should support the compliance activities.

Which PMO type is more suitable in such an environment?

A) Supportive

B) Directive

Correct answer
C) Center of excellence

D) Controlling

Overall explanation
Since the projects are extremely complex, agile approaches will be more suitable for these projects. We learned in the lectures that agile PMOs act as a center of excellence; therefore, this type is more suitable for such an environment.

Question 169
Skipped
The project manager is informed about a compliance audit will be conducted next week.

Which of the following options is not true about compliance audits?

A) During these audits, the nonconformities are detected

Correct answer
B) The primary purpose of these audits is to reward/punish the team members for meeting/not meeting compliance requirements

C) Compliance audits can be helpful for improving the compliance activities

D) New lessons can be learned as a result of these audits

Overall explanation
The primary purpose of conducting compliance audits is to verify the compliance; awarding or punishing the team members cannot be a purpose for these audits to be conducted. All other options are true about compliance audits.

Question 170
Skipped
The budget is $100,000. You made the performance calculations and obtained the following results:

CPI = 1.15; SPI = 1.25

Now you are about to make an estimation of the total cost of the project when it is completed. What would be your answer?

A) $100,000

Correct answer
B) $86,956.52

C) $80,000

D) $88,312.24

Overall explanation
Since the budget of the project is $100,000, then BAC=$100,000. We can use the following formula of EAC:  EAC = BAC / CPI EAC = $100,000.00 / 1.15  = $86,956.52

Question 171
Skipped
One of the stakeholders asks about the benefits of the project. This stakeholder can find information about the benefits in which documents?

(Choose the best two answers)

Correct selection
A) Benefits realization roadmap

B) Product backlog

C) Statement of work

Correct selection
D) Business case

Overall explanation
This stakeholder can find information about the high-level benefits in the business case. Besides this, in the Benefits Realization Roadmap, information about benefits and when they expected to be realized can be found.

Question 172
Skipped


According to the given network diagram, what is the critical path?

Correct answer
A) A-B-D-F-H

B) A-B-F-H

C) A-E-H

D) A-C-G-H

Overall explanation

If we do the forward pass and backward pass calculations, A-B-D-F-H is found to be the critical path.

Question 173
Skipped
You have the following performance indexes for two projects;

Project 1: CPI=0.70 TCPI=1.20

Project 2: SPI=0.90 TCPI=1.20

By only considering these variables, which of the following is true about these projects?

A) Both projects are under budget

B) Project 1’s probability of completion within the budget is higher than Project 2's

C) Project 2’s probability of completion within the budget is higher than Project 1's

Correct answer
D) AC is greater than EV for Project 1

Overall explanation
Since the TCPI is greater than 1 for both projects, both projects are over budget. Since TCPI’s are equal, their probability of completion within budget is the same. CPI=EV/AC; since CPI is less than 1 for project 1, AC is greater than EV.

Question 174
Skipped
The product manager realizes that one of the benefits hasn’t been realized on time. He holds a meeting with the team member who is responsible for this benefit. When the product manager asks for the reason for being late, the team member says he doesn’t know anything about this benefit; in addition to this, he claims he doesn’t know he is responsible for this benefit.

What should have been done to prevent this issue?

A) The benefits realization plan had to be issued to the stakeholders

B) The benefit ownerships in the information radiator had to be followed by the team member

C) The team member had to be invited to the kick-off meeting

Correct answer
D) The benefits management plan had to be signed off by the team member

Overall explanation
Since the team member claims he doesn’t know he is responsible for this benefit, we understand that they haven’t got agreed on ownership of the benefit. Once the benefits management plan is created, it should be signed off by the key stakeholders including the benefit owners; this is the way of getting agreed on ownership of the benefit.

Question 175
Skipped
When executing the project, the stakeholders should be informed about the progress of the benefits.

Which of the following options can be helpful for this purpose in highly uncertain environments?

A) Communications management plan

B) Retrospectives

Correct answer
C) Sprint reviews

D) Daily standup meetings

Overall explanation
In highly uncertain environments, we use agile approaches. The communications management plan can be helpful in predictive projects, not in agile projects. In agile projects, sprint reviews are held to discuss what the team has built and this is a good opportunity to inform stakeholders about the progress of the benefits.

Question 176
Skipped
It was the middle of the project when the rival company released a high-capacity product to the market. If the cross-functional team releases the final product as it was planned at the beginning, the product may not compete with the rival’s product; therefore, it is clear that some parts of the final product need to be changed.

What should they do first?

A) They need to create a change request and apply the change after the request gets approved

Correct answer
B) They need to analyze the impacts of the change on all aspects of the project

C) The project manager assesses the backlog and adds the change during backlog refinement

D) The product owner assesses the backlog and adds the change during backlog refinement

Overall explanation
In the question, it says there is a cross-functional team; therefore, this is an agile project. In agile projects, we don’t create any change requests. Since ‘it is clear that some parts of the final product need to be changed’, we understand that the need for the change has already been defined, and now it is time to analyze the impacts of the change on all aspects of the project.

Question 177
Skipped
You are the Project manager of an ongoing website development project. You are currently using software named SoftX to do most of the work. A team member says: "If we use the software EasyX instead of SoftX, this will fasten all of the work since it is more user-friendly and easy to use." You know EasyX very well and you think that the team member may be right. What should you do?

A) Since you know he is right, tell him: "You may start to use the software EasyX"

B) Since the project has already been started, you should reject this request

C) You should ask for a change request

Correct answer
D) You should check how this choice would affect other constraints first

Overall explanation
If there is a situation causing a change, you should check how that choice affects other constraints first. After that, you should identify other options if they exist, and then, you should make a change request. You need to know this order for the exam!

Question 178
Skipped
To add the stories or remove them from the product backlog, and prioritize the stories in the backlog, which of the following options will be less important than other options?

Correct answer
A) Capacity of the team

B) Minimum viable product

C) Product roadmap

D) Risks

Overall explanation
When adding stories or removing them from the product backlog, minimum viable product, and the product roadmap will be helpful because they provide high-level product visibility. When prioritizing/reprioritizing the stories in the backlog, the value and the risks the stories have will be important. The capacity of the team is not a factor they should consider during backlog refinement.

Question 179
Skipped
You are the project manager for an electrical project. The customer asks you about a change and you know that this change will speed up the project. What should you do first?

A) Apply the change since it will speed up the project

B) Explain customer the impacts of this change

C) Tell the customer, you cannot apply the change because it is not written in the project scope statement

Correct answer
D) Talk about all the alternatives with your sponsor

Overall explanation
If there is a change request, you should evaluate it first. You should not decide whether to apply the change or not without explaining the impacts of the change to the customer. Therefore, A and C are not correct. However, before talking to the customer, you should talk about the alternatives with your sponsor first.
Question 180
Skipped
The rivals of Organization A started using agile approaches when conducting their projects and they are getting lots of positive feedbacks from their customers. Although Organization A is experienced in predictive environments, they would like to start applying agile approaches because this will help them to compete with their rivals. But there are lots of impediments due to the organizational culture. Some of the staff are scaring of working in a transparent environment and this is just one of the impediments.

Which of the following approaches can be helpful in such an environment?

(Choose the best two answers)

Correct selection
A) The project manager should try to be a model for other team members by applying agile practices

B) They can use ‘scrum of scrums’ to handle this situation

Correct selection
C) They should determine a pilot project to apply the agile practices and start applying agile in this project first

D) They should provide technical training to the team members to ensure the agile processes are applied smoothly

Overall explanation
As you will remember from the lectures, the scrum of scrum technique is used, to divide the project team into smaller teams; this technique will not be helpful to overcome the organizational culture. Technical training also will not be helpful to overcome transparency fears. If the project manager himself/herself works in a transparent environment, he/she will become a model for the team members and this approach can be helpful for this staff to work in such a transparent environment. Determining a pilot project to apply agile practices is also a good idea when transiting from a predictive environment to an agile environment.
