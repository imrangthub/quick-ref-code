Which type of Project Management Office provides a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects?
Directive
Correct answer
Supportive
Controlling
External Consultant
Overall explanation
Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. This type of PMO serves as a project repository. The degree of control provided by the PMO is low. In contrast, Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. The degree of control provided by the PMO is moderate. Compliance may include (Adoption of project management frameworks or methodologies, use of specific templates, forms, and tools, conformance to governance frameworks). And finally, Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. Project managers are assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by the PMO is high. Whether or not the PMI is an external consultant is irrelevant to this question.

Herman's project team is completely virtual. Which of the following is not an example of communication technology he should consider to address team development issues that can arise from a project team not working in the same physical location together?
Correct answer
Fax Machines
Video Conferencing
Email
Audio Conferencing
Overall explanation
Communication technology is important in addressing the team development issues in colocated and virtual teams. It helps build a harmonious environment for the colocated team and a better understanding for the virtual team, especially those working in different time zones. Examples of communication technology that may be used are: -Shared portal. A shared repository for information sharing (e.g., website, collaboration software or intranet) is effective for virtual project teams. -Video conferencing. Video conferencing is an important technique for effective communication with virtual teams. -Audio conferencing. Communication within a team using audio conferencing is another technique to build rapport and confidence within virtual teams. -Email/chat. Regular communications using email and chat is also an effective technique.

While writing his Risk Management Plan, Steve's been interviewing project stakeholders and recording various of their responses to his questions regarding how much variance from what's planned they'll accept. For example, the project sponsor is okay if the budget is never more exact than plus or minus 25% of its current forecast, while an Information Systems stakeholder will not accept any deviation from the technical requirements that she provided to the RFP process the project undertook. In the meantime, the portfolio steering committee has made it clear they will be tolerant of a 4% change in budget from what's forecasted. Which output of the Risk Management Plan is being described here?
Risk Management Plan
Reporting Formats
Definitions of risk probability and impacts
Correct answer
Stakeholder risk appetite
Overall explanation
Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the definitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.

Overall explanation
Agile teams focus on rapid product development so they can obtain feedback. In practice, the most effective agile teams tend to range in size from three to nine members. Ideally, agile teams are colocated in a team space. Team members are 100% dedicated to the teams. Agile encourages self-managing teams, where team members decide who will perform the work within the next period’s defined scope. Agile teams thrive with servant leadership. The leaders support the teams’ approach to their work.

In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed ______________ for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses on the current project scope and deliverables.
Correct answer
planning
requirements gathering
budget
analysis
Overall explanation
The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints that are documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope is defined and described with greater specificity as more information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Define Scope process can be highly iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses on the current project scope and deliverables.

Augustin attends a steering committee one day where he, as the project manager of a multi-million dollar construction project, is celebrated and praised by all the steering committee members for finding a flaw in the original architect's blueprints that could have cost the city nearly one million dollars if it had been discovered after the building was already under construction. However, Augustin wasn't the one who actually discovered the error; he was merely the one who brought it to the architect's attention, and he tells the committee members as much. In being honest and forthright about who the credit should really go to, which leadership quality has Augustin displayed?
Correct answer
Giving credit to others where due
Giving feedback constructively
Managing expectations
Accepting feedback graciously
Overall explanation
Augustin demonstrated several leadership qualities, and all of the options presented are ones all project managers, as leaders, should display. However, for the particular scenario presented, "Giving credit to others where due" is the correct answer. A leader proves him or herself a leader by not taking credit for something that wasn't entirely their doing. Even if the Project Manager did have a part in what occurred, they should still always give credit to all involved parties. This behavior goes a long way toward solidifying loyalty and operating with integrity and in an ethical manner.

When you are tasked with "project knowledge management," what type of project knowledge is it that you are managing?

Tacit Knowledge.

Explicit Knowledge.

Knowledge of the project's requirements.

Correct answer
Both Tacit and Explicit Knowledge.

Overall explanation
Project knowledge management through the lens of the Project Management Institute, involves the management of both objective information (explicit) and subjective information (tacit). While explicit knowledge is structured and fixed (e.g. "the facts"), tacit knowledge is personal and context specific (e.g. feeling or judgment). Knowledge of the project's requirements is handled via the documentation of requirements, which is one example of explicit knowledge, but isn't the only knowledge you are tasked with managing on a project.

Nigel has just taken over as the third project manager assigned to a project that has seen considerable delays and cost overruns, caused by difficulties in getting the vendor to deliver what's in the contract. He gathers vendor representatives and his company's stakeholders together for a face-to-face meeting to bring everyone back to the same page. While they're taking a break he overhears a conversation in which someone who works for the vendor admits that the only reason they got the contract is because their president is an old college buddy of Nigel's company's Vice President of Finance, not because they could actually produce what their customer needed. What should Nigel do?
Nothing. It doesn't matter how they got the contract. The fact is that Nigel's there to manage what exists no matter how it happened to come about.
Confront the vendor immediately
Report an ethics violation to the Project Management Institute immediately
Correct answer
Notify his project's stakeholders immediately
Overall explanation
Nigel has to notify his project's stakeholders immediately, as it is up to them to decide whether or not to take action based on this new information. They may confront the vendor openly, they may confront their own VP of Finance or they may decide to just let it go and try to force the vendor to perform according to the contract terms. But that's their decision to make, not Nigel's. However, if Nigel had chosen NOT to report this new knowlege then he would've been in violation of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and someone could have reported HIM to the PMI for that lapse in professional responsibility.

The project life cycle is organized into four phases that are typically sequential. How do the costs and staffing levels of a project change from the beginning to the middle to the end of the project throughout the life cycle?
Costs and staffing are both higher at the beginning of a project because of unknowns.
Both costs and staffing levels start low and stay low until the end of Executing a project and then remain high through completion.
Correct answer
Both costs and staffing levels start low, increase rapidly, and decrease.
The staffing is higher at the very end of a project because of what had to be done to complete it, so costs are higher, too.

Activity Attributes
Resource Requirements
Project Schedule
Overall explanation
Activity attributes. These extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include the unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the place where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned schedule activities in various ways within reports.

Tabitha's halfway finished with her project initiation tasks and is contemplating when she should hold her project kick-off meeting. The project is small, involving only two departments and their mutual processes and the same team is handling both the initiation and the planning processes. By this criteria, when should Tabitha schedule her kick-off meeting to occur?
She should have conducted it before she started the Initiating processes

At the end of the Planning process group, at the start of the development/implementation in the Executing process group

Correct answer
Shortly after Initiation, in the Planning process group

At the beginning of each project phase

Overall explanation
For small projects, there is usually only one team that performs the planning and the execution. In this case, the kick-off occurs shortly after initiation, in the Planning Process Group, because the team is involved in planning. In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the project team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation. In this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group. Only multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.

He discovers that all of the identified stakeholders he can label as Neutral, as they are neither supportive nor unsupportive of the project. However, there is one stakeholder who, when he sits down to meet with them, isn't even aware of the project or its impacts. How should Philippe label that particular stakeholder in his matrix?
Resistant

Supportive

Correct answer
Unaware

Leading

Overall explanation
A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix supports comparison between the current engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired engagement levels required for successful project delivery. The engagement level of stakeholders can be classified as follows: -Unaware. Unaware of the project and potential impacts. -Resistant. Aware of the project and potential impacts but resistant to any changes that may occur as a result of the work or outcomes of the project. These stakeholders will be unsupportive of the work or outcomes of the project. -Neutral. Aware of the project, but neither supportive nor unsupportive. -Supportive. Aware of the project and potential impacts and supportive of the work and its outcomes. -Leading. Aware of the project and potential impacts and actively engaged in ensuring that the project is a success.

Overall explanation
Data representation is meant to provide a look at data in a more visual graphical way than listing the data in columns, rows, tables or cells. Project schedules are word and number based data and while Gantt Charts do help give a more visual view into the schedule, the key in this question was that the listed techniques occur in conjunction with managing quality on a project, and a Gantt Chart is unrelated to Project Quality Management.

There are three potential solutions for Travel Trucks Unlimited's project which aims to refresh their fleet of delivery trucks to ensure they're getting the best gas mileage and are as safe as possible for their drivers. They could replace the entire fleet of 20 trucks with brand-new vehicles, they could simply do an overhaul on each of their existing trucks or they could choose the best 10 and overhaul those, while completely replacing the worst 10 trucks. What form of analysis should they do now to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action?
Correct answer
Decision Tree Analysis
Sensitivity Analysis

Overall explanation
Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both threats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative or positive. The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal path to be selected.

Correct answer
Contracts
Formal communication between them and you
Overall explanation
The contracts made with any external entitities for project work must be closed out, which includes final payments and sign-off on completion. Though you may formally end communication between you and them, that is not a requirement of the Closing phase. Similarly, if there are open risks then the project is either not ended or those risks are being transferred to Operations as part of the Closing process. And finally, an RFP is a point-in-time document used to solicit bids from external vendors for the work you need performed or the goods you need to procure.

Your project to overhaul your office's temperature regulation system had an original, approved budget of $575,200. By the time you were halfway through project you had estimated the budget at completion would be $582,760. After all invoices had been paid, as you were performing the final checks in preparation for writing your project close report, your calculations indicated that the actual expenditure was $596,231. What is the Variance at Completion of this project?
($13.47)
$21,031
($21,031)
Correct answer
$13,471
Overall explanation
To calculate the Variance at Completion (VAC) you use the following formula: VAC = BAC (Budget At Completion) - EAC (Estimate At Completion). Using the amounts provided in the question, then, BAC ($596,231) minus EAC ($582,760) = VAC ($13,471).

Since they're all being delivered by the same vendor, Trevor devises a calculation that becomes a mathematical model that he can input deliverable type, estimated duration and his new calculated factor of "lag time" into, and obtain what he feels is a good projection for how late - or not - the next three deliverables are likely to be. What type of analysis has Trevor just used to make this determination?
Variance analysis
Earned value analysis
Cost-benefit analysis
Correct answer
Trend Analysis
Overall explanation
Correct answer: Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the project for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in the schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to recommend preventive actions if necessary. Earned value provides an integrated perspective on scope, schedule, and cost performance. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual performance. This can include duration estimates, cost estimates, resources utilization, resources rates, technical performance, and other metrics. And finally, Cost-benefit analysis helps to determine the best corrective action in terms of cost in case of project deviations.

Dorian's managing a project to refresh all servers for a global organization with more than 60 offices worldwide. It's had a lot of ups, downs and unexpected changes to both scope and schedule, and as the project team completes server refreshes for the sixteenth office, the project steering committee asks to understand the project's cost performance. What formula should Dorian apply in order to provide them with this information?
EAC = AC + New ETC
Correct answer
CV = EV - AC
SPI = EV/PV
SV = EV – PV
Overall explanation
CV, which stands for Cost Variance, is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time. It is a measure of cost performance on a project and is achieved by subtracting the actual costs (AC) of the project from the earned value (EV). However, in order to use this equation you have to first calculate Earned Value, which shows how much of the budget and time should have been spent, considering the amount of work done. So if you have spent 3/4 of your budget but you're only supposed to have spent 1/4 of it, then your EV is not at all good. Conversely, if you're halfway through the project and have only spent 1/4 of your estimated spend, then you are ahead of the game. EV = Total Project Budget x (times) Percent (%) of project completion. The EAC formula is to calculate the estimate at completion, which is not what the steering committee asked for. SV is the schedule variance, which has nothing to do with the cost variance equation. And finally the SPI is the schedule performance index which also does not help in determining the cost variance of a project at a given point in time.

Overall explanation
A data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve analysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project. The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding requirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management reserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.

Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identified in the PMBOK® Guide is required on every project. Tailoring should address the competing constraints of scope, schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the project manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational culture, stakeholder needs, and other variables. The cost limitation and the schedule limitation are both constraints for Esther's project.

tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3 is the formula for Three-Point Estimating in which you estimate project duration with very little historical data to go on. In the equation, E represents the Estimate, O the Optimistic duration based on the best-case scenario and M is the Most Likely activity duration given a number of analyzed factors. What does the P represent?
Correct answer
Pessimistic
Prescient
Purposeful
Pie-in-the-sky
Overall explanation
Pessimistic is correct. The purpose of three-point estimation in order to determine your best activity duration is to identify the best-case (optimistic), worst-case (pessimistic) and most likely scenarios, and then essentially take the average of them by dividing the three numbers by 3. So if your best-case is 10 hours, your worst-case is 24 hours and your most likely duration is 17 hours, you add 10 + 24 + 17, which equals 51. And then 51 divided by 3 is 17 (and if you use the Excel AVERAGE formula, you'll find you get the same answer). This method is beneficial if you are basing your activity durations on peoples' judgments rather than known data. For example, if you know it takes 8 hours from start to finish to stand up a working server, then you don't need three-point estimation because you already know that activity's duration for a fact.

While discussing the different PMISs they're all using, Ediz shares that he prefers providing status reports via a combination of web conferencing, since his stakeholders are scattered across the United States, and publishing the reports and a project monitoring dashboard on a password-protected website only they can access, which also serves as an online project management tool they use to provide statuses to each other. Which PMIS Tool or Technique are Ediz's preferred methods an example of?

Correct answer
All three of these answers are correct
Electronic communications management
Social media management
Electronic project management tools
Overall explanation
The following definitions/examples from the PMBOK demonstrate why Ediz's preferences demonstrate all three of the PMIS tools and techniques under Project Management Information System (PMIS): -Electronic project management tools: Project management software, meeting and virtual office support software, web interfaces and work management tools -Electronic communications management: Email, fax, and voice mail; audio, video and web conferencing; and websites and web publishing -Social media management: Websites and web publishing; and blogs and applications, which offer the opportunity to engage with stakeholders and form online communities

Which of the following is not a key benefit of the Initiating process "Develop Project Charter?"
It shows the organizational commitment to the project

It creates a formal record of the project

Correct answer
It promotes the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration management

It provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the organization

Overall explanation
Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. Key benefits of this process are that it provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the organization, creates a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project. The one that doesn't belong is "promotes the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration management" because this describes how iterative and agile approaches benefit project integration management.

What is a project stakeholder?
Someone who runs the project.
An individual, group or organization who believes very much in the project objectives and does everything they can to promote it to the rest of the involved parties.
A person or group of people who perceive themselves to be affected by the project.
Correct answer
An individual, group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.
Overall explanation
Stakeholders can be individuals, groups or entire companies, and what makes them stakeholders is the most important part of this definiton, which is "who may affect, be affected by or perceive itself to be affected by." Remember that for many, perception is reality and so even if their belief is only a perception, they are no less a stakeholder than someone provably affected by the project. Stakeholders do not run the project and those who perceive themselves as affected are not hte only possible types of stakeholders. The final incorrect response describes project champions - these are the proponents of the project...the cheerleaders, if you will...to other individuals, groups and organizations. While champions are usually stakeholders, not all stakeholders are champions.

Question 86

A project is contracted on a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) basis. The contract states that if the final costs are less than expected costs, the sharing formula for cost savings is 80:20. The targeted cost is US$750,000 with a 10 percent fee. If the project comes in at US$720,000, what would be the total cost of the contract?
Correct answer
US$756,000
US$720,000
US$750,000
US$736,000
Overall explanation
In a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) type of contract, the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs for performing the contract work and receives a predetermined fee. In some cases, if the final costs are less than the expected costs, then both the buyer and the seller benefit from the cost saving based on a pre-negotiated sharing formula. For this question: the predetermined fee is 10% of US$750,000 = US$75,000. Since the project came in at US$720,000, the cost saving is 750,000 - 720,000 = 30,000. The sharing formula is 80:20, so the additional payout to the seller = (20/100)*30,000 = 6,000. Therefore, the total cost of the contract = 720,000 + 30,000 + 6,000 = US$756,000. Clearly this is to the disadvantage of the buyer, whose original estimate was less than this amount.

A few of the managers who were identified as Interested Stakeholders, have come to Lily, the project manager for a project to revamp a company's Marketing website, and asked her to give them an updated project budget. Lily tells them it will take a little time, as she'll have to evaluate the relationship between the consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished by those expenditures. The managers protest that she doesn't need to do all that to control project costs; that all she needs to do is tell them how much of the budget has been spent. Lily stands her ground, arguing that only by monitoring work completed vs. money spent can she give them an accurate picture of where things stand. Which Project Cost Management process is Lily pulling these principles from?
Estimate Costs
Determine Budget
Correct answer
Control Costs
Plan Cost Management
Overall explanation
Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Monitoring the expenditure of funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other than to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control is the management of the approved cost baseline

Lindsey's project involves a lot of people who work in shifts, rather than a "9 to 5" day. It's going to be difficult for her to remember when each of the project team members is available, and how that availability affects their assigned tasks, without something to help manage that. What's one output of the Acquire Resources process that will provide her with a tool she can use throughout the rest of the project to keep the resources organized?
Physical Resource Assignments
Correct answer
Resource Calendar
Project Team Assignments
Change Requests
Overall explanation
Of the choices presented, only the Resource Calendar meets Lindsey's needs. A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is available. Information on which resources (such as team resource, equipment, and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when and for how long identified team and physical resources will be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or skill level, as well as various geographical locations.

Amber and Aurora are both performing software development tasks on a project to develop a new medical software to help doctors tune hearing aids more accurately for an individual patient. As Amber continues her work, Aurora sees her code degrading right in front of her eyes and realizes that one of the risks she had voiced earlier on in the project is coming true: the more Aurora tells the software to fine-tune the higher decibel ranges, the less capable it becomes of accurately identifying the lower decibels. She brings it to Aurora's attention and after a short discussion they decide they need to report it to the Project Manager, Nishan, who pulls out the Risk Management Plan and sees that the team had developed a risk response should this occur. What should Nishan do now that the risk has now come to pass?
Correct answer
Execute the previously defined risk response
Tell Amber and Aurora not to worry about it

Overall explanation
Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually executed. A common problem with Project Risk Management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk. Only if risk owners give the required level of effort to implementing the agreed-upon responses will the overall risk exposure of the project and individual threats and opportunities be managed proactively.

A project manager may use Organizational Process Assets, or OPAs to help write a project charter. Which of the following are NOT OPAs?

Your IT department's change control process for software implementations
Correct answer
Laws that the local government has just passed regarding the manner in which your company is allowed to do business
Your organization's Project Management templates
Your company's phase gating process (by which the organization approves a project to proceed to the next phase)
Overall explanation
If laws are passed which impact how your organization does business, those fall under the category of Enterprise Environmental Factors or EEFs. The other three examples are indeed OPAs: templates are often enforced or desired by an organization, for everything from forms that're filled out to project artifacts such as the charter. Change control processes may need to be factored into a project's schedule simply because it's an internal control standard which must be met regardless of why. And finally, if your company controls how a project moves from one phase to the next then that is yet another internal hurdle you must sail over in order to proceed with the project. None of those are caused by forces external to your organization, but instead are caused by internal mechanisms and decisions.

Integration at the System Level
Integration at the Cognitive Level
Integration at the Process Level
Overall explanation
The correct answer is "Integration at the System Level" because "System Level' is made up. Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project objectives. Although there is no stated definition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small chance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact. The project manager should strive to become proficient in all of the Project Management Knowledge Areas. In concert with proficiency in these Knowledge Areas, the project manager applies experience, insight, leadership, and technical and business management skills to the project. Finally, it is through the project manager’s ability to integrate the processes in these Knowledge Areas that makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.

Why is it important to identify and document stakeholders as soon as possible after the project charter has been signed and a project manager has been assigned to a project?
Doing so increases a project's chances of success by ensuring those who need to be involved are involved from the beginning.
Because a stakeholder can negatively influence the project, it's best to know about them as soon as possible to help mitigate the risk they pose.
To provide visibility into aspects of the project that may not have been considered had stakeholders been misidentified or excluded.
Correct answer
All of these.

Overall explanation
Starting a project's Planning phase without knowing a) who all the impacted people or companies are, b) understanding why they are impacted, positively or negatively, by the project's outcome, and c) having a good handle on the environment within which the project is operating, sets a project up for failure rather than success. If the sales manager is not engaged on a project trying to implement new sales goal calculations then he may block the project from implementing even if the project team's spent 6 months trying to find the best solution, if for no other reason than that he has not lent his expertise to the solution identification process which means something may have been missed that's important to him or the company, or there may be state laws he knows but the project team didn't consider.

This is a project that is undertaken every ten years, and the company keeps good Organizational Process Assets and project artificats on file. What project artifact or place should she look at first to learn the pitfalls, successes and challenges the project team encountered the last time this upgrade project was done?
Correct answer
Lessons Learned Repository
Project Management Plan
Customer Acceptance Documentation
Change Management Documentation
Overall explanation
While it's true that Jayanthi may find the other resources useful, the first place to look is the Lessons Learned Repository. Lessons learned and knowledge gained throughout the previous project may save Jayanthi and her team a lot of time, money and trouble if accounted for - or at least identified as potential risks - from the moment she receives the assignment.

When you think about how best to tailor project integration management to your project's needs, which of the following items is NOT a question you will want to ask?
Correct answer
How important is quality management going to be on this project?
What is an appopriate project life cycle?
What is the change management process going to be on this project?
What are the project status reporting requirements?
Overall explanation
Even if your project is very small, or delivering something seemingly simple, there are still going to be acceptance criteria that will have to be met. The question is not about the importance, as quality management is always important. Responses B, C and D are good examples of questions that you can ask yourself and the team in order to help tailor the management of a project to more realistic parameters for the depth and breadth of each individual project. Other questions you can ask include how you're going to manage knowledge, which management process will be most effective and how best can you collect lessons learned.

Garrett's in charge of a robotics project where a prototype robot designed to enter buildings, provide live video feed and navigate using its own Artificial Intelligence has to be built so it can then be tested for how it can maneuver in a hostage negotiation situation. Which of the four dependency attributes is this an example of?
Dependency
External
Internal
Correct answer
Mandatory
Overall explanation
Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built, or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities, and internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and are generally inside the project team’s control. Becuase the prototype is being built from several different contractors' components, they are not all inside the project team's control and that's why this isn't a "Mandatory Internal" dependency.

Joni's about to attend a meeting in which a very important decision on which part to use for the widget her project team is producing, will be made. She believes from what most of her team's told her that Part A is the best choice but has no vote as it is a business and manufacturing decision. The project sponsor has agreed that he will abide by whatever the Majority Vote is at today's meeting. If there are 18 people in attendance including Joni, how many must vote for Part A in order for it to be chosen?
17
Correct answer
9
10
18
Overall explanation
Though there are 18 people at the meeting, one of them is Joni. But Joni is the project manager and as the problem tells us, she does not have a vote in which part is chosen since it's a business and manufacturing decision. This leaves 17 people eligible to vote. The definition of a Majority Vote is that more than 50% of the members of the group have to vote a certain way for that to be the decision. 50% x 17 = 8.5. So if 9 people vote for Part A, then Part A will be chosen. (Of note: Had Joni also been allowed a vote, then Majority would have had to be 10 or more votes for Part A in order for it to win, as 50% x 18 = 9, and more than 50% automatically takes us to 10 votes.)

When the stakeholders on Quinton's software development project became upset by seemingly unforeseen delays in the development of the user interface portion of the project, the project sponsor looked to Quinton, as the Project Manager, for understanding as to why the team had not realized that the one person needed to create that user interface would be unavailable due to his daily operational tasks. Quinton could look at the resource assumptions recorded on the assumption log that's been kept since the creation of the project charter, but he suspects the overallocation of this particular resource is a systemic, larger issue the organization needs to address. Where might he investigate outside of his own project documents, to see if his hunch is correct?
Emails
Project Charter
Issues Log
Correct answer
Business Case
Overall explanation
The key wording in this scenario involved the project resource's operational obligations keeping him from completing the project work. High - level strategic and operational assumptions and constraints are normally identified in the business case before the project is initiated and will flow into the project charter. Chances are - in this case, at least - that the assumption was made during the business case that all resources required would be available as needed. That assumption would have then carried on through the project charter and if no one sought to validate it, would explain why the project suddenly finds itself without the one resource it needs to keep the project moving. If you assume a resource of any kind is available, and you schedule the project and make promises based on that information, then you may find yourself in Quinton's unfortunate position where he now has to explain why he didn't check to be certain during the Planning processes that the original business case assumptions were accurate.

Magnus has inherited a project that was handled from inception as a predictive life cycle project. However, he quickly discovers through trial and error that the stakeholders don't exactly know what they want until they see it, and decides it would be better to provide them with the first part of the new toy car they're building, then add the next bit of functionality (remote control) to it, followed by the ability for it to climb over obstacles in its path, then to spread hidden wings out from its sides and finally to launch itself into the air and fly. The team agrees that each milestone can be met in 3 months. What type of project life cycle is Magnus switching to?
Correct answer
Incremental
Adaptive
Iterative
Hybrid
Overall explanation
In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any changes to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles. -In an iterative life cycle, the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but time and cost estimates are routinely modified as the project team’s understanding of the product increases. -Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the functionality of the product. -In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add functionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufficient capability to be considered complete only after the final iteration. -Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is defined and approved before the start of an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. -A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project that are well known or have fixed requirements follow a predictive development life cycle, and those elements that are still evolving follow an adaptive development life cycle.

No matter whether you're just starting a project, deep in the planning phase, executing on your solution or closing up the project, a project manager is expected to control and monitor what's happening at every step of the way, and is therefore the only process that overarches all the others.

Question 158
Skipped
What is the purpose of the initiating process?
Correct answer
To define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
To develop a business case for the purpose of obtaining authorization to embark upon the project management process.
To create a project charter and stakeholder register.
To kick off the planning phase of a project.
Overall explanation
Though the project charter and stakeholder register are outputs of the initiating phase, they are not the reason the phase is done. The purpose of this phase is to obtain someone's (or a group of someones') authorization to start a project. The business case doesn't work here because that's a precursor to the initiating phase, allowing a company to decide whether there's enough of a case to even begin writing a charter, for example. And finally, the planning phase isn't kicked off by the intiating phase. The planning phase simply begins once signoff on the initiating phase is obtained.

Cara works for a company that sells multi-functional furniture and she's tasked with a project to produce one new ten-page "how to" pamphlet every two weeks for sixteen weeks, in order to provide customers with quick and easy reference guides for their new multi-functional line of beds. Cara's team gained a little ground during the recent holiday season because none of them took vacations. At next week's steering committee meeting she is going to use a new EVM technique to explain to project stakeholders how far ahead of schedule the project is based on what they've accomplished versus when they originally meant to have accomplished that goal. What emerging Project Cost Management technique is Cara going to use?
Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
Planned Value (PV)
Correct answer
Earned Schedule (ES)
Actual Time (AT)
Overall explanation
ES (Earned Schedule) is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM (Earned Value Management). Earned schedule theory replaces the schedule variance measures used in traditional EVM (earned value − planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate equation for calculating schedule variance ES − AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project is considered ahead of schedule.

The Project Management Plan is one of the inputs to the Validate Scope process. The other three are possible outputs. Deliverables that meet the acceptance criteria are formally signed off and approved by the customer or sponsor. Formal documentation received from the customer or sponsor acknowledging formal stakeholder acceptance of the project’s deliverables is forwarded to the Close Project or Phase process. Work performance information includes information about project progress, such as which deliverables have been accepted and which have not been accepted and the reasons why. And finally, the completed deliverables that have not been formally accepted are documented, along with the reasons for non-acceptance of those deliverables.

The Cost Management Plan contains cost estimates, which generally includes consideration of risk response planning, such as contingency plans. A Risk Management Plan would have defined the risk and even the mitigation strategy, but it would not have explicitly defined an associated contingency cost. The Requirements Traceability Matrix documents business requirements, while the project charter, completed in the Initiating phase, will generally not do much more with costs than provide a very high-level dollar amount, if any at all.

Correct answer
Developing a business case that can be used to inform the creation of a project charter.
Engaging project stakeholders
Obtaining approval to proceed to the next phase of the project
Understanding a project's purpose and objectives
Overall explanation
A project manager must engage stakeholders to obtain the information necessary to complete a stakeholder register. The project manager must also understand a project's purpose and objectives well enough to articulate them in a project charter, and may be the person engaging decision-makers after the charter's written, in order to obtain approval to proceed. The development of a business case does not happen within the project management life cycle at all, but is a pre-cursor to something becoming a project, and thus while a project manager may have involvement at that stage, it occurs before the Initiating process begins.

Forget about them and focus on getting the Executing tasks completed on time.
Wait until the risk is realized and then try to remember what the mitigation strategies were.
Correct answer
Give the required level of effort to implement the agreed upon responses to manage the risks proactively.
Make sure it's saved in a Risk Register and/or Risk Report.

Electric Light Bulbery has just entered into a contract with Brite Lite Chandeliers and Lamps to supply them with 5,000 specially made conical light bulbs per week for twelve weeks, totalling 60,000 light bulbs, for $350,000. However, if Electric Light Bulbery can deliver all 60,000 bulbs in only 10 weeks, they'll get a $20,000 bonus and whatever it might cost to do so is on them. What type of contract did these two companies sign?
Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA)
Correct answer
Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)
Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)
Firm fixed price (FFP)
Overall explanation
Electric Light Bulbery has a fixed price contract, in that they'll be paid a certain amount for delivering all the light bulbs within the specific timeframe, but they'll be rewarded if they can deliver the entire amount two weeks early. This is a fixed price ($350,000) with an incentive fee ($20,000). A firm fixed price would not have included the bonus (incentive). There is no mention of any economic price adjustments, so it's not an FPEPA and the only reason the contract is not a CPIF is because Electric Light Bulbery has set a fixed price regardless of cost. If meeting the shorter 10-week timeframe costs them additional funds, that's not something they're going to get reimbursed for in this particular scenario.

The time has come for Devon to decide which tools he's going to use to manage configuration change control on his software development project. Which of the following is NOT a potential tool he could choose for this specific purpose?
Correct answer
Requirements Traceability Matrix
Perform configuration item verification and audit
Identify configuration item
Record and report configuration item status
Overall explanation
Of the options presented, the only one that is not a tool for configuration change control is the requirements traceability matrix, which is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. In order to facilitate configuration and change management, manual or automated tools may be used. Configuration control is focused on the specification of both the deliverables and the processes, while change control is focused on identifying, documenting, and approving or rejecting changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines. Tool selection should be based on the needs of the project stakeholders including organizational and environmental considerations and/or constraints. Tools should support the following configuration management activities: -Identify configuration item. Identification and selection of a configuration item to provide the basis for which the product configuration is defined and verified, products and documents are labeled, changes are managed, and accountability is maintained. -Record and report configuration item status. Information recording and reporting about each configuration item. -Perform configuration item verification and audit.

So far the first baseline change was to the scope, which also resulted in a schedule change adding 2 months to the timeline. The second baseline change was to the project's cost, as was the third. Their most recent discovery has resulted in yet another schedule change and the change request to add six more weeks to the project schedule was just approved by the project's steering committee. When Martin re-baselines the schedule, what is the "starting point" he should use to calculate the new dates?
The first baseline
Correct answer
The third baseline
The second baseline
the original project schedule/estimated completion date
Overall explanation
Changes to baselines are only made from the last baseline forward. Past performance is not changed. This protects the integrity of the baselines and the historical data of past performance.

If you work in a hospital's Information Technology department, and you are in charge of managing only network and server changes because you're IT, while the neuroscience managers are responsible for implementing a remote stroke assessment network, the billing department manager is responsible for implementing new billing codes hospital-wide and the Facilities manager is responsible for the project to modernize all hospital elevators, what structural type of organization is your employer?
Projectized organization
Weak matrix organization
Correct answer
Functional organization
Balanced matrix organization
Overall explanation
Each department in a functional organization will do its project work independently of other departments. That's not to say that other departments don't get called upon for tasks, such as the neuroscience manager requiring IT to open up network ports or firewalls for their software to work, but the actual project management happens within each functional silo rather than from a centralized Project Management Office.
