Question 1
Incorrect
Monica is the project manager for a technical implementation project, the Circuit Project. The customer has asked her to factor in after-the-project costs, like service and maintenance. Of the following, which one is an example of this scenario?
Correct answer
Life-cycle costs
Your answer is incorrect
Operations
Scope creep
Project spin-off
Overall explanation
The correct answer is life-cycle costs, which describe after-the-project costs. Operations is an incorrect response because it does not fully describe the product's unique expenses. Project spin-off may be a tempting choice, but it is incorrect because it does not explain the process of ongoing expense calculation of the product that the project is creating. Scope creep is an incorrect answer because it does not explain the ongoing calculation expense process of the project's product creation.

Question 2
Incorrect
As the project manager for the Merchant Company, Nico is meeting with her project stakeholders to review the project plan and the different components needed as part of project execution. During project execution, which of the following will help Nico the best?
Stakeholder analysis
Correct answer
PMIS
Your answer is incorrect
Scope verification
Change control boards
Overall explanation
PMIS (project management information system) is the correct answer. While it does not replace the project manager's role, it can assist the project manager the most during project execution.CCBs (change control boards) may assist the project manager but do not offer as much control and assistance as a PMIS. Stakeholder analysis is incorrect because it should have been done during the process of project planning. Scope verification is incorrect because it does not assist the project manager, and it is proof of the projects' work.

Question 3
Correct
Marsha recently joined a massive organization as a project manager. Because this is a sizeable institutional organization, she has trouble connecting with her project team members, who have been established in their role for several years before Marsha joined. Team members know their jobs and have little need for guidance. Marsha learns from another project manager that her team members do not like being told what to do. Their last project manager was not respected because he was ego-driven and arrogant with the team. Marsha wants to earn the respect of her project team, take them to the next level, and not interrupt the good things that they are already doing. What kind of leadership style can she adopt to accomplish this?
Directing
Autocratic
Laissez-Faire
Your answer is correct
Servant leadership
Overall explanation
Servant leadership is the answer for Marsha In practicing this, she will facilitate her team's work, remove obstacles and advocate for them when needed. In time the team will view her with respect and as someone who has their best interests at heart, which will be a winning strategy for Marsha. This team would not welcome an autocratic approach as the project manager makes all decisions for the project team. This project team is already operating in a Laissez-Faire style. A directing approach would not be appropriate as the team knows what to do in the project. A directing approach, similar to autocratic, directs the team members on what to do next in the project.

Question 4
Correct
As a project manager, it is your responsibility to meet with contractors and vendors and negotiate for project completion resources. You negotiated with ABC Electrical concerning a breaker box placement for the new facility your organization is building. You get a call from the worksite's foreman informing you that the breaker box was set in the wrong place even after making sure that he knew where the journeyman was to place it before the electrician left. What do you do to make sure that ABC Electrical meets the negotiated contract specifications?
You proceed to tell the foreman that it is his fault that the breaker box was set in the wrong place, and he is responsible for fixing it.
You deem this part of the project complete and work with the foreman and stakeholders to redesign the floor plan.
Your answer is correct
You contact the contractor and have them meet you at the worksite and step through the contract, including the documentation of where the breaker box was to be set. You inform the contractor that they must correct their mistake.
You call the contractor and take responsibility, as the project manager, for the mistake and ask for another quote to set the breaker box in the correct location.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to contact the contractor and have them meet you at the worksite and step through the contract, including the documentation of where the breaker box was to be set. The vendor will likely agree and move the breaker box to the correct location. Calm and rational communication can usually resolve issues in projects. This breaker box is in the wrong location and must be corrected. Redesigning the floor plan around the mistake is not a practical solution. It is not the foreman's fault for the incorrect location; the vendor had the confirmation and documentation to place the box in the correct location. The vendor must fix the problem. It is not your fault that the box was in the wrong location, so there is no need to approve the current location or pay for the relocation of the box.

Question 5
Correct
You are a project manager for your organization. You are currently determining the physical resources, the amount of resources needed, and when the resources will be required in the project schedule. This is called which one of the following?
Source selection
Resource process selection
Your answer is correct
Resource planning
Resource selection
Overall explanation
Resource planning considers the resource pool, resource availability, resource costs, and resource calendars against the project calendar, scheduled activities, and the overall need for particular resources to determine what is the best resource for a given activity. Resource selection involves choosing which resource is appropriate for the project team or the project work. Source selection is a procurement process to determine which vendor is the best choice for the project work. Resource process selection is an invalid term.

Question 6
Incorrect
Leah is an agile coach for an organization seeking to adopt agile project management methodologies into its daily processes. Leah is assigned to a research and development team that historically had issues relating to a lack of good leadership and guidance. Upon further investigation, Leah determines why this team has these issues because previous team leaders tried to find solutions that appeased all team members rather than making the best decisions for the project. What type of decision-making technique did the previous project manager make?
Your answer is incorrect
Force or direct
Withdraw or avoid
Collaborate, or problem-solve
Correct answer
Compromise or reconcile
Overall explanation
In this scenario, the previous team leaders used the compromise/reconcile conflict resolution technique. This technique involves searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties to resolve the conflict temporarily or partially. This approach occasionally results in a lose-lose situation. Forcing means that the person with the power makes the decision. Collaborate and problem-solve aims to find the best solutions in a spirit of cooperation, rather than finding a solution that will appease stakeholders. Withdraw or avoid makes no decision, and the project manager or decision-maker removes themselves from the decision.

Question 7
Incorrect
Dori is the project manager for a minor publishing house specializing in academic texts. A printing run she oversees goes very wrong when the books' bindings are attached upside down. Before the publishing house throws away the books', Dori keeps one as well as the quality control form used to justify the printing. She periodically uses the book and the form as props for presentations about the importance of quality assurance. This is an example of which element of project governance?
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Correct answer
Capturing lessons learned
Your answer is incorrect
Stage-gate or phase reviews
Defining roles and responsibilities
Overall explanation
Capturing and emphasizing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices. Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations.
Domain
Process
Question 8
Correct
In agile development, teams tend to have more effective sprints as the project matures with each increment handed off and accepted by the user groups. What is the main reason behind the agile team's continuous improvement?
Your answer is correct
Use of feedback loops
Ability to change the scope
Servant leadership
Efficient use of resources
Overall explanation
Feedback loops allow the team to continuously learn from their performance during the sprint, allowing for introspection within each sprint. Teams will improve their performance as their ability to estimate increases with time, thus improving goal setting and performance. Utilization of resources is good, but effective feedback loops are the best choice. Servant leadership helps the team, but it is not the top reason for sprint effectiveness. The ability to change the scope happens throughout the agile project.

Process
Question 9
Correct
You are the project manager for your organization and you are creating cost estimates with your project team. A work package within your work breakdown structure is estimated to cost $50,000, with an accuracy range of ±10 percent. The control account for this portion of the WBS has a risk that a particular resource may not be available due to a higher priority project within your organization. If this risk occurs, the cost will rise by up to $2,500. Which type of risk is this an example of which of the following choices?
Project risk
Your answer is correct
Systemic risk
Total risk
Estimate risk
Overall explanation
Systemic risks apply to environmental factors, availability of resources, political influences, and technology use, to name a few. A project risk is simply a risk, positive or negative, that can affect the project. An estimate risk is not a valid project management risk type, so this choice is incorrect. Note that there can be risks with flawed estimates, but the idea of an estimate risk is not valid. A total risk is not a valid project management risk type, so this choice is incorrect. Total risk is not the same concept as total risk exposure, so this choice is not the best one presented.

Question 10
Correct
You are a project manager in a weak matrix. You have recently completed the project schedule. You must now get the project schedule approved so that the resources can be officially assigned to their project work. Which one of the following stakeholders will need to approve the project schedule?
Project team members
Your answer is correct
Functional managers
Project champions
No one; the project manager has autonomy on the project in this structure
Overall explanation
The functional managers in a weak matrix will have to approve the project schedule. Project champions do not approve the project schedule. The project team does not approve the project schedule; they may provide input but not approval. The project manager has limited authority in a weak matrix structure.

Question 11
Correct
Your team has been tasked with the construction of an aircraft hangar for a nearby airport. As the project manager, you know your team will need to produce many documents before completing the hanger. As this will be your first major project, your sponsor wants you to gain a solid grasp of these documents and how to use them. To ensure you gain a firmer understanding of project artifacts, you decide to test yourself on the topic. Which of the following artifacts will not help you prepare to construct the aircraft hangar?
Schedule management plan
Risk register
Your answer is correct
Release plan
Constraints
Overall explanation
Release planning is a process in which you determine the number of iterations or sprints needed to complete each release, the features each iteration will contain, and the target dates of each release. A release plan is generally associated with agile projects; this is a predictive project, as it is a construction project, so this is not a viable choice. Constraints are anything that limits the project manager's options, such as a fixed budget or deadline. The schedule management plan defines how the schedule will be controlled and monitored throughout the project. The risk register lists all risk events, their risk score, and relevant risk information.

Question 12
Correct
Jackson is a program manager whose department has recently merged with another. Although he has some knowledge of what the other department does, he is unaware of how much funding each project has within the department and the number of projects that are currently active. He requires this knowledge to ensure that his department's funding is consistent with the new projects and the projects his programs include. Which level of knowledge is required?
Your answer is correct
Portfolio-level
Individual-level
Project-level
Surface-level
Overall explanation
Portfolio-level knowledge usually requires knowledge of several programs within an organization. The amount of funding for and status of multiple projects within a program or portfolio would qualify. Individual-level knowledge is required when a single employee performs a task or tasks. Project-level knowledge is typically spread among project managers, leaders, and team members. Surface-level knowledge means the learner has a shallow or basic understanding of the concept being learned.

Question 13
Correct
Joshua knows that his Phone Corp team's new product will face stiff competition, as multiple vendors are making similar products. The best approach for his team is
Your answer is correct
To deliver a minimum viable product as quickly as possible.
To make a risk log that is visible on the wall in the team’s area.
To complete a comprehensive risk analysis with all stakeholders.
To make sure the product is delivered with all features that competitors will include.
Overall explanation
It is most important to get an MVP out to market as quickly as possible to prevent other competitors from taking market share by putting out a product first. More risk analysis is not needed. Having a fully-featured product that could take longer and cost market share is not an agile practice. More visible risk logging is not an immediate focus in a competitive situation.

Question 14
Correct
Dave is a scrum master for the Digital Library Project. The project is eight iterations into its deployment and has recently had a wide variation in velocity. The project team is frustrated that they have not finished the sprint backlog as planned. During the retrospective, they discuss how the requirements are unclear, and they do not understand the size and effort of the project work. What should Dave do next?
Change the team's velocity.
Assign more people to fewer tasks.
Your answer is correct
Work with the team and product owner for better estimating.
Coach the team to choose fewer stories.
Overall explanation
The best choice is for Dave to work with the team and product owner for better estimating. Better estimates will help the team complete the work in the iteration and not frustrate the team as much as poorly estimated work. Assigning more people to fewer tasks does not solve the root cause of the scenario. Choosing fewer stories may let the team take on less work but does not solve the poorly designed requirements or user stories. Changing the team's velocity does not address the root cause of poorly written requirements or sizing misunderstandings.

Process
Question 15
Correct
Heather’s team has determined that their software would benefit from a few customers reviewing the user story and agreeing that it is finished. Her team is most likely doing this because
Customers are involved in their retrospectives.
Your answer is correct
The team has agreed that ‘accepted’ is the definition of done.
They have a software that every user will like.
The team has agreed that ‘tested’ is the definition of done.
Overall explanation
The best choice is that the team agrees that an ‘accepted’ product is their definition of done. Only when customers accept the product is it then done. Customers reviewing the product do not have anything to do with calling it ‘tested.’ Customers reviewing the product do not have anything to do with being involved in a retrospective. There is no guarantee reviewing a user story and agreeing that it is finished means that every user will like it.

Question 16
Incorrect
Aaron has written a statement that briefly discusses in his charter who the project is for, what their need is, what the product/service is, and the product category. He is most likely writing
Correct answer
A project elevator statement
An agile approach statement
A project planning statement
Your answer is incorrect
A standard project charter
Overall explanation
This is a description of a project elevator statement. A standard project charter would not specifically include this. The project planning statement and agile approach statement are fictional terms.

Question 17
Correct
Spyke is the project manager for the Beach Project, which is nine weeks into implementation, six weeks into a twelve-week timeline, and one week behind schedule. Recently several team members complained to Spyke that it is incredibly challenging to find project documentation. They know there is a project drive on the network, but the information is not sorted logically or named with a structure that is easy to access. What should Spyke do?
Print all documentation in a central project binder.
Your answer is correct
Assess how documentation is stored and adjust accordingly.
Save all project documents to the cloud.
Assign one team member to manage project documentation.
Overall explanation
Spyke should assess how project documentation is handled and adjust so that it can be used effectively. Saving project documents to the cloud may not solve Spyke's challenge. Assigning one team member to project documentation will reduce the project's bandwidth. Printing the documentation in one central project binder is not a practical solution for the team to access and update documentation.

Question 18
Correct
You are the senior project manager for your organization and management has asked you to serve as a mentor to a group of new project managers. As you prepare for mentoring these junior project managers, you want to identify the best practices of the organization and why the mentorship should happen. Which of the following is not a benefit of mentorship?
The mentee's problem-solving ability improves through mentorship.
The mentee gains more significant communication skills through mentorship.
Your answer is correct
Over time, mentorship provides more authority to the mentee.
Mentorship improves the mentee's competencies.
Overall explanation
Mentorship is beneficial for many reasons; however, mentorship does not relate to authority. A mentee cannot expect to gain more authority through a mentorship. A mentorship allows a mentee to gain competencies, improve their communication skills and their problem-solving abilities. Mentorship improves the mentee's competencies is a valid statement about mentorship, so this is not a valid answer for this question. The mentee's problem-solving ability improves through mentorship is a valid statement about mentorship, so this is not a valid answer for this question. The mentee gains more significant communication skills through mentorship is a valid statement about mentorship, so this is not a valid answer for this question.

Question 19
Incorrect
Sarah is the project manager of a project designed to create an online help manual for customers of a product her company sells. Samuel, a writer for the project, takes considerably longer than what was planned to create the documentation. Though Samuel’s work is excellent, if he continues to be late with the needed documentation, the project will be late. Which of the following is not an appropriate corrective action for this problem?
Assign Samuel to noncritical activities.
Your answer is incorrect
Determine why Samuel’s work is late.
Correct answer
Remove Samuel from the project team.
Assign other writers to some of Samuel’s project work.
Overall explanation
Because Samuel is a good writer, it would be detrimental to the project to remove him entirely. The project manager should determine why the problem exists and then respond to the problem with corrective actions. It may be beneficial to offload some of Samuel’s assigned work to other writers. The project manager should determine why Samuel’s work is late. It may be appropriate to assign Samuel to noncritical path activities.

Question 20
Incorrect
You are the project manager of the KNB Project for your organization. One of the first things you need to determine in your project planning is your grade of material as part of this specific construction project. Danny, a team member, says the grade needs to be high quality, or risks will enter the project. Mark says the quality determines the grade, not the quality. Max says that grade is just a ranking that you use when selecting material. Seth says that grade and the installation of the material constitute the quality of the project. Which team member's statement is correct?
Correct answer
Max
Mark
Seth
Your answer is incorrect
Danny
Overall explanation
Max has the correct statement. The grade is a technical ranking assigned to a product or service, such as different grades of lumber or first class versus coach class when flying. Quality and grade are not the same. Danny's statement is incorrect as quality and grade are not the same things. Quality is about satisfying stated or implied needs; grade is a ranking of a product or service. Mark's statement is incorrect. Quality is about satisfying stated or implied needs; grade is a ranking of a product or service.

Alise is the project manager of a project constructing a nursing home facility. She must report on the effectiveness of managing project artifacts and providing suggestions to improve them at the end of each project phase. Which of the following guidelines should Alise not use when assessing the effectiveness of project artifacts?
Correct answer
Use the maximum degree of configuration management for the project.
Your answer is incorrect
Implement version control of documents to reconstruct changes and revert to an earlier version if necessary.
Follow any organizational procedures regarding project management documentation.
Develop an archive management system that is of appropriate size and complexity for the project.
Overall explanation
Alise should only need to use the appropriate degree of configuration management for her project, not the maximum degree. Assessing the effectiveness of project artifacts includes developing an archive management system that is appropriate in size and complexity, implementing a version control system, and follows organizational procedures regarding project management documentation.

Chris is the risk manager for a significant airline construction company. According to the project schedule, the construction of a new aircraft is in progress and is approximately 50% complete. While performing a regular audit of the work progress, Chris notices that some workers are not wearing the proper personal protective equipment per the posted Health & Safety requirements. In this scenario, what should Chris do?
Correct answer
Notify the worksite supervisor immediately.
Ignore the situation as it is not Chris's responsibility.
Your answer is incorrect
Document the incident in the risk register.
Tell the workers to stop work.
Overall explanation
The situation at hand is a safety issue that requires immediate attention. Chris should inform the worksite supervisor as it is their responsibility to prevent any unnecessary non-compliance issues. Ignoring the situation is not a valid answer as it does not address the problem. Telling the workers to stop working is immediate is not under the risk manager's direct responsibility. Chris should inform the worksite supervisor immediately of the situation. Documenting the Risk Register incident is a logical step but is not the most pressing concern to address.

Question 23
Correct
Ryan’s agile project at Jabot Cosmetics is subject to regulatory compliance from the FDA. They will require extensive documentation as part of the approval process for his work. What are his options for handling this need?
Your answer is correct
His team may complete this documentation as they go, after product development, or in a hybrid model of the two.
This cannot be an agile project, as projects requiring regulatory compliance should be done with the traditional methods.
His team must complete this documentation as each feature is developed.
His team may complete this documentation either in each iteration or at the end, but not both.
Overall explanation
Compliance work can be completed with each iteration, after product development, or both ways, with some of the work completed along the way and some done at the end. Compliance work does not have to be done using traditional methods. Compliance work can be performed as each feature is developed. Compliance work does not have to be done only with each iteration.

Upon studying the information, she begins to question the validity and accuracy of these reports. The reports must be valid as she will be presenting these to management next week. What should Natasha do next?
Submit a change request.
Your answer is correct
Perform a quality audit.
Train the project team in quality principles.
Revise quality metrics.
Overall explanation
Natasha should perform a quality audit. A quality audit will ensure that the quality control rules are being followed and the metrics being measured are valid for the project. In the future, she may need to submit a change request, train the team in quality principles, or revise quality metrics. However, she cannot determine what needs to be done until she conducts a quality audit.

Question 26
Correct
You are working with management on the project planning processes, and they want to know why you are spending time on risk management planning so early in the project planning. Which one of the following is the best response to management's concern?
You believe, as the project manager, that the project has too many risks to be successful.
Risk management planning must happen before any other planning activities.
Your answer is correct
Risk management planning increases the probability of success for the other risk management processes.
All projects have risks.
Overall explanation
Risk management planning does increase the possibility of success for the risk management processes. Risk management planning is not about risk identification but rather how to approach and conduct risk management activities. This statement is not true. This statement is incorrect because this concern centers on risk identification and response, not the approach to risk management.

Timely distribution of documents
Version control and security
Your answer is correct
A flexible process for the review and approval of documents
A way to produce and control documents without the unnecessary administrative overhead

Darcey is the project manager for her organization, and she is planning her project budget. Her project is the remodel of a warehouse. It is clear that some part of the work will be outsourced and contracted to the Total Glass Company. The project sponsor has informed Darcey that as the project is finished, he hopes that no more than $25,000 will be spent on the contracted work. This $25,000 value is known as the
Correct answer
Target price
Price
Your answer is incorrect
Sunk Costs
Profit
Overall explanation
Darcey's project has a $25,000 target price for the procured items. A target price refers to the expectation of a final price before the work has started. You might also see this as a not-to-exceed amount or a price ceiling. Price is a good second choice, but the target price is the best choice. The target price is the ideal cost for the procured amount of materials. Sunk costs describe the amount of funds that have been spent on the project to date. These are monies that have been sunk into the project. Profit is the difference between the total cost of the project and the revenue generated from the project.

Todd's team produced a line of clothing. Unfortunately, they learn that 1 in every 100,000 pieces produced contains compromised stitching. Without inspecting all the pieces, Todd's team cannot ensure that some of the damaged pieces will not go out, but inspecting all of them will put their shipping timeline at risk. Todd decides to continue with the shipping timeline and to offer a refund or replacement for any of the damaged pieces as they appear. Which risk management option does this represent?
Avoid
Transfer
Mitigate
Your answer is correct
Accept
Overall explanation
Accepting risk means acknowledging it without taking proactive action. It is typically appropriate for low-priority threats. Avoidance occurs when a team works to eliminate a threat or otherwise protect a project from risk. Transfer entails moving risk to another party, often a neutral third party like an insurer, to negate or minimize the impact of a realized risk. Mitigation requires action to reduce the probability or impact of a risk.

Value engineering
Your answer is incorrect
Time constraint
Learning curve
Schedule constraint
Overall explanation
The correct response is value engineering, a systematic method to find less expensive ways to complete the same work. Schedule constraint is incorrect because it is not described in this scenario. A time constraint is not described in this scenario and is therefore incorrect. The learning curve happens as the team completes the project work and is incorrect.

Harry plans to build out his software in several sprints over the course of a year. The software's core functionality will make it immediately useful for the three departments that will use it. Once it is deployed, each subsequent sprint will be used to develop a new module to accompany the core functionality. For instance, an accounting module will allow the accounting department to pull in its data and use it to populate a series of dashboards. Once all of the modules are incorporated, Harry's project will go into maintenance mode. Which project methodology is appropriate?
Iterative
Your answer is correct
Incremental
Predictive
Agile
Overall explanation
Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time. Predictive project life cycles are based on the specification of requirements and substantial planning during the beginning phases of a project. Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project's life cycle. Agile project life cycles continuously elaborate their requirements based on feedback obtained following a sprint to add a feature or group of features to a product.

Cathy is the scrum master for Project M, which is in its planning stage and has a budget of $75,000. Cathy notices that a stakeholder has asked for time to send the project team to assess their personalities. When asked why, how is the stakeholder likely to respond?
This is standard practice in agile.
Your answer is correct
Understanding how everyone on the team works will help them work better together.
The stakeholder has an extra budget they want to spend.
The stakeholder owns a personality assessment company.
Overall explanation
Having the team gain an understanding of how they and their teammates operate will help them better face challenges and work as a unit. Having an extra budget to spend is rare and is not the best choice for this question. This answer is impractical and not the best answer choice presented. This is not standard agile practice.

The integration of third-party resources, contracts, and legal documentation collected will be used as an input to which of the following?
Updated lessons learned
Your answer is incorrect
Contract administration
Correct answer
Close project or phase
Control procurements
Overall explanation
The closure phase includes completion guidelines, requirements, and contracts to finalize all activities in the project's phase. Also, organizational process assets are included along with project audits, project evaluations, and transition criteria. Contract administration is not a valid PMBOK process or group. Updated lessons learned are an output of the Close project or phase. Control Procurements manages procurement relationships and contract performance.

Your answer is correct
Earned Value Management
Overall explanation
Earned Value Management (EVM) is defined as a comparison of the cost of the project compared to another metric, such as time. Agile Project Accounting is a set of principles on the financials that is irrelevant. Earned Value Ratio is also an irrelevant term.

Individuals during public meetings, process changes during public meetings
Your answer is correct
Individual team members, process changes
Overall explanation
Individual coaching is best typically one on one during an iteration, where coaching on process changes is likely completed during meetings for planning, reviews, and retrospectives. These answers are not accurate choices for coaching. Coaching would focus on individual team members more at the start of the project, whereas process changes would not occur until a sprint is needed. There is no public meeting requirement.

Nicole is leading an agile project for her organization. The project requirement is significant, and there is an urgency to complete the project work as quickly and accurately as possible. Nicole's project team has contracted developers to augment the local development team members to increase the total story points the team can complete per iteration. The contracted staff will work virtually and will only serve until the project's end and be released. The contractors and the internal project team members have no common past and have never met face-to-face. Where will the team have the most significant risk to team effectiveness in this scenario?
Coordination
Correct answer
Initial trust
Your answer is incorrect
Communication
Job satisfaction
Overall explanation
Building trust among virtual members is critical. Trusting one another is a key factor when teams move through team development. Lack of common ground is problematic for building trust. Lack of trust has the most significant risk of hindering dimensional social factors such as relationship building and cohesion, associated with better performance and virtual team effectiveness. Coordination may be a small challenge, but agile projects keep coordination simple through daily meetings, Kanban boards, and the iteration backlog. Communication is always paramount in any project, but it is not the best answer for this scenario as trust is needed to speak transparently and directly among the project team. Job satisfaction is not the best choice when addressing internal and external team members' effectiveness in completing the project work.

Question 37
Correct
You are the project manager of a construction project. You have procured an electrician to complete the wiring for the project. The electrician reports that he is finished with the services you have hired him to complete. Which one of the following must you do next regarding the electrician?
Your answer is correct
Inspect the work results
Sign off on the work
Pay the invoice
Complete the invoice
Overall explanation
Once the vendor reports that the work is complete, the project manager should inspect the work. This inspection can be done firsthand if the project manager is qualified or by another qualified person or group. The vendor completes the invoice for the buyer. The project manager will pay the invoice according to the project contract and verify that the work is complete. The project manager will sign off on the work once it has been inspected and deemed acceptable.

Question 38
Correct
Sean is the scrum master for Project E, which is beginning its first iteration. After the kickoff meeting, a stakeholder approaches Sean and tells him he is concerned his team will not benefit from Project E until the project is done. How is Sean most likely to respond?
The stakeholder is correct; the team will only benefit once the project is complete.
Your answer is correct
Agile projects deploy incremental benefits over each iteration.
Re-prioritize tasks so this stakeholder benefits sooner.
Refer the stakeholder to the product owner.
Overall explanation
Agile projects constantly deploy updates, so this stakeholder will begin seeing small, incremental benefits as the project progresses. The stakeholder is incorrect as agile provides deployments continually. Referring the stakeholder to the product owner is not the best answer. Re-prioritizing the tasks is not ideal as this may not align with Project E’s objectives.

Question 39
Incorrect
Tracy Lynn is on a project team with the Blue Arrow Corporation and she is leading a project to develop an online catalog for customers. Nan has been working overtime to ensure a specific feature will be completed on time. The feature will recommend related items for customers when they add items to their online shopping cart. This requirement is taking a considerable amount of time and may delay the project's go-live date. Nan and Tracy Lynn are in a status update meeting with the key stakeholders to discuss the requirements and the timeline. The stakeholders sound upset that the project may not make its deadline. The project manager explains that Nan is putting in extra work, that the schedule will be met on time or very close to its deadline, and that the problem is not as big as it seems. What strategy is the project manager using?
Withdrawing
Collaborating
Correct answer
Smoothing
Your answer is incorrect
Forcing
Overall explanation
The project manager uses smoothing in an attempt to minimize the problem by downplaying how big it is to calm down the stakeholders. Tracy Lynn may believe this to be true, but she should work with Nan to get a true grasp on how large the problem is and the likelihood of meeting the project end date. Collaborating would involve the project manager working with the team and stakeholders to identify a solution. Forcing would involve the project manager overriding the stakeholders and telling them the project is acceptable. Withdrawing would involve the project manager not engaging with the stakeholders.

Question 40
Incorrect
You are the project manager for a construction project in your organization. This project requires coordination with the director of manufacturing, HR, the IT department, and the CIO. The director of manufacturing wants to ensure that materials are delivered to the job site only as they are needed because of space limitations. What approach to resource management is this?
Total productive maintenance
Human resource coordination
Your answer is incorrect
Kaizen
Correct answer
Just-in-time manufacturing
Overall explanation
With just-in-time manufacturing, resources are in place only as they are needed. This approach reduces waste, keeps inventory at a minimum, and helps the project manager forecast resource utilization more accurately. Kaizen utilizes changes to the organization and project team over time, resulting in large changes overall. Continuous maintenance on equipment and quality systems keeps equipment working well and efficiently. This approach aims to reduce downtime by avoiding equipment failure. Human resource coordination is not a valid project management term.

Frank is the project manager for Project PU, which has just completed its planning stage. Besides sharing the work breakdown structure and other details about tasks and milestones, what additional information should Frank pass along to the project management office for their approval?
Frank's vacation schedule.
Your answer is incorrect
The product backlog.
Correct answer
A project resources requirements list.
The roles and responsibilities matrix.
Overall explanation
Frank should ensure the project management office is aware of Project PU's resource requirements to plan and provide the resources as required for project success. Frank's vacation schedule may be necessary, but it is not the most critical piece of information to pass along. Predictive projects do not have a product backlog. The roles and responsibilities matrix is not the best answer to this question.

Question 42
Incorrect
Your organization has recently returned from working at home to working together in the office. You are utilizing a scrum approach to project management. Which project team composition includes a set of team members where everyone physically sits together?
Virtual teams within 33 meters of each other
Correct answer
Collocated teams within 33 feet of each other
Outsourcing to many consultants and vendors all in one locale
Your answer is incorrect
Cross-functional teams within 33 feet of each other
Overall explanation
Collocated teams indicates that there is a functional team working on a project sharing the same workspace. The team should be within 33 feet of each other. Cross-functional teams describe teams where members can do more than one activity, not a team that is physically located in one space. Virtual teams describe team members that work from multiple locations rather than one central location. Virtual teams are non-collocated. Outsourced teams are hired from a vendor, not necessarily working in one location.

Your answer is correct
She has regular face-to-face conversations regarding questions and issues the developers face.
Regularly updates relevant documentation as minimal as possible to get the job done and just in time for the developers' needs.

Question 44
Correct
During a sprint retrospective meeting, Ken notices that his team member Kevin is on his phone and disengaged from the team. It is critical to the team's success that everyone participates in the retrospective meeting and openly and candidly shares their feedback. How can Ken ensure his team members and Kevin are not distracted during their retrospective meeting?
Hire a trained facilitator to keep the team engaged.
Your answer is correct
Facilitate a team discussion on team engagement.
Update the team charter and include a clause not to have phones present in the meeting.
Give each team member a specific task with a learning outcome to share.
Overall explanation
Knowledge sharing and feedback are significant contributors to the team's success, particularly in an agile environment. By facilitating discussion on engagement, you solidify the importance of all team members contributing to their development and the team's development by fully participating and being present during the retrospective meeting. Ken should not update the charter independent of the project team. There is no need to spend the additional funds for a meeting facilitator. Giving each team member a specific task with a learning outcome to share is not a great answer as you want the team to share multiple times and share what is on their mind, rather than directing them what to share in the meeting.

Erik spends a lot of time working with the project team to develop the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). He prefers to make it as simple as possible for his team to identify their specific contributions to his project. As a result, he assigns different tasks to different roles rather than specific people and clarifies the expected deliverables for each task. The result is that Erik's employees only come to him if they need clarification but are otherwise self-directed. This is an example of which type of project governance?
Your answer is incorrect
Stage-gate or phase reviews
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Correct answer
Defining roles and responsibilities
Capturing lessons learned
Overall explanation
Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations. Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Capturing and emphasizing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices.

You are a project manager for your organization. You have procured four staff members from a vendor to help with the project work. Two of these staff members are no longer needed on the project. Which document will determine how the procured project team members may be excused from the project?
Your answer is correct
The contract between your organization and the vendor
The scope management plan
The schedule management plan
The staffing management plan
Overall explanation
The contract between your organization and the vendor will determine how long the project team members will be allowed to, or are required to, stay on the project. The staffing management plan will concur with the contract details to determine how procured resources are released from the project. The scope management plan determines how the project scope may be changed. The schedule management plan determines how changes to the schedule will be managed.

Paulina is the project manager for Project Beehive, which is nearing its final week of implementation and is getting ready to deploy multiple deliverables across several departments. A few stakeholders are concerned they will receive the wrong deliverables because they work in more than one department. How can Paulina handle these concerns?
Your answer is correct
Thoroughly document and share the delivery process with stakeholders.
Hire a third party to assist.
Assign a team member to deliver everything.
Ask the stakeholders to come and get their deliverables personally.
Overall explanation
Paulina should document the process of delivery and share this plan with stakeholders. This will give them visibility into the process and help calm their concerns. This will also ensure that people get the correct deliverables. Asking the stakeholders to come and get their deliverables personally may not be possible and is not ideal. Having a team member deliver the deliverables may not be possible and is not ideal. Hiring a third party is not the best option as it may not address stakeholder concerns.

Calvin is responsible for identifying and advising on risks for a medium-sized software company. His portfolio includes a line of software programs, all of which have new versions slated for release during buying season for several large clients. Unfortunately, analysts recently discovered that some of the software has a debilitating bug. Calvin anticipates that the damage to his client's reputation will outweigh the cost of pushing the release back until the bug can be resolved, so he advises them to do so. Which risk management option does this represent?
Escalate
Mitigate
Your answer is correct
Avoid
Transfer
Overall explanation
Avoidance occurs when a team works to eliminate a threat or otherwise protect a project from risk. Escalation occurs when the scope is beyond the project's original parameters, or the required response would exceed the project manager's authority. Transfer entails moving risk to another party, often a neutral third party like an insurer, to negate or minimize the impact of a realized risk. Mitigation requires action to reduce the probability or impact of a risk.

Jonis is a scrum master for a software development project. The project team is made up of nine people, five of which have worked together in the past. During the stand-up, Jonis notices that one of the team members frequently stays quiet and only offers information when explicitly called upon. What should Jonis do?
Your answer is correct
Privately chat with the team member to see if everything is going well.
Call out the team member from the next stand-up meeting for not speaking up.
Write up the team member for not contributing to stand-up meetings.
Nothing, if the team member needs help, he will ask.
Overall explanation
Every member of an agile team should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts during the meetings. Jonis should make time to connect with this team member and find out the reason for being quiet. Ignoring the fact that this team member is quiet may be ignoring warning signs that something is wrong. Calling this individual out during the meeting may only embarrass him. The team member has not violated any rule, so writing him up will not help.

Your answer is correct
Apply the project's change control methodology to the stakeholder's request.
Reject the change since the stakeholder did not submit it properly.
Refer the stakeholder to the project management office.
Overall explanation
Tanya should refer to Project CA's appropriate change control methodology and encourage the stakeholder to follow that process. Tanya should not accept the change as it has not gone through the appropriate process. Tanya should not reject the change as it has not gone through the appropriate process.

Joel, a young, enthusiastic employee, recently transferred to one of his company's satellite offices in Japan. During Joel's first meeting with his new team, a project manager introduces Joel and quickly transitions to a discussion about the project's status to date, noting that they have a supply chain issue and beginning an in-depth presentation about it. Eager to contribute, Joel shares with the group that his former office encountered the same issue and gives an overview of how they solved it. The project manager thanks Joel for his contribution and continues the presentation. One week later, Joel realizes that he has not been invited to an important meeting with the team. What is the source of the conflict?
Personality
Correct answer
Cultural differences
Team environment
Your answer is incorrect
Project priorities
Overall explanation
Cultural differences drive this conflict. In some cultures, discussions are open-ended. In others, they are more formal. Speaking out of turn might help inform a conversation but may also come off as impolite. Personality is the driving factor in a conflict when an individual's behavior puts them at odds with the team and the project's priorities. Still, it is typically not the source of a conflict when the behavior is meant to help. Team environment conflicts deal with the physical and political environment of the project. This is often evident during the storming phase of team development. Project priorities are a source of conflict when two or more project managers have a demand for the same resource, such as a team member or facility. This can also be when there are competing demands from different projects in a matrix structure. Personality conflicts usually stem from an individual's lack of emotional intelligence or belligerence in the project.

Question 52
Correct
Fox and his stakeholder, Walter, have a difficult relationship. Although Fox is a dedicated project manager, his unorthodox methods for completing projects significantly differ from Walters' by-the-book approach. This leads to significant mistrust between Fox and Walter so that Walter often requires objective information corroborated by multiple sources before he will act on (or against) Fox's suggestions. Fox recognizes the difficulties inherent in the relationship and knows that he needs Walter's approval for the decisions that will make or break his projects. Which method should the project manager use to build trust and influence with the stakeholder?
Issue identification
Progress reporting
Meetings
Your answer is correct
Surveys
Overall explanation
Surveys are appropriate if a stakeholder requires the input of a large number of people in addition to the project manager's personal input. If the relationship between a stakeholder and a project manager is not strong, surveys can be used to build a case for or against a certain position. Issue identification is the best way to build additional trust and influence with a stakeholder who already has a high level of trust with the project team. Meetings are a useful way to build trust and influence with stakeholders, but only if they have a lot of free time and prefer to work through issues organically. Progress reporting is helpful if stakeholders prefer to keep a close watch on the status of projects, understand the fundamentals of a project well, and do not have time to perform a deep dive.

Lena is an exceptional analyst who does excellent work. Unfortunately, she often volunteers to take on more tasks than she can handle. As a result, some team members do not have enough work as milestones approach, and Lena does not ask for help completing a task until the last minute. Before a meeting with a stakeholder, Lena confides to her project manager that she will not have several deliverables ready on time. How should the project manager respond?
Tell the stakeholder that some tasks will not be completed on time.
Correct answer
Ask Lena to tell that stakeholder that her tasks will not be completed on time.
Your answer is incorrect
Stop allowing Lena to volunteer for extra work.
Assign the tasks to other team members during the meeting.
Overall explanation
If employees have accountability for their work, they are less likely to take on more work than they can handle. Letting employees know that they are responsible for reporting their work status to stakeholders is an excellent way to impart accountability. Covering for employees that cannot complete their work hurts the team at the expense of the employee. It is not appropriate to assign tasks during a meeting if they should have been completed before a meeting. Since Lena is a good employee, her desire to volunteer is valuable to the team, but accountability will ensure that she does not try to do too much.

Henry takes each user story and creates polished documents that explain the details in a diagram. Henry’s agile coach will likely tell him that
Models provide the most benefit at the end of a project.
Models should never be produced in an agile project.
Agile modeling is a great tool that plays a critical role in every user story.
Your answer is correct
There should not be a focus on polished models in an agile project.

Sal is the project manager for an agile project that is ten weeks into deployment. This project is $5,000.00 under budget and one week behind schedule. Over the next few weeks, an outside consultant will be on-site to help the project team learn about new technology. One team member is concerned this will take project time. What is Sal's most likely response to this concern?
The project has some extra budget to spend.
The project is only one week behind schedule, so an additional delay is acceptable.
Sal wants to keep everyone busy regardless of the project scope.
Your answer is correct
Team development is important to project success, and the training is needed.
Overall explanation
Ensuring the team is developing new skills and keeping up with technical demands is important to the project's success. An extra budget is not a valid reason to spend the money. This concept is called gold-plating. The schedule delay can be a concern, but there may be even more delays if the team does not understand the technology they will be working with on the project. Busy work is not a good practice in project management, as all work should add value, not just keep the team busy.

Raquel is the scrum master for Project CF, which is in its third iteration and has a velocity of thirty-one story points. While reviewing the project backlog, tasks, and schedule, Raquel realizes that a specific vendor will be needed two weeks sooner than expected. What should Raquel do next?
Correct answer
Review the vendor's contract to determine if they can be brought in earlier.
Your answer is incorrect
Escalate the issue to the product owner.
Adjust the project schedule so that the vendor is not needed until it was initially planned.
Delay the project for two weeks.
Overall explanation
Before taking any action, Raquel should determine if the vendor can be brought in two weeks earlier. The answer to this question will guide her next decision. In the real world, Raquel could simply call the vendor and ask, but this is not a practical answer to the question. The product owner is unlikely to be able to assist. Adjusting the project schedule runs the risk of Project CF being off schedule. Delaying the project runs the risk of Project CF being off schedule.

Wanda is a project manager for the Soap Corporation. She is operating in a strong matrix and has led projects for this organization over the past three years. In a status meeting with stakeholders, several people complained that the project reports they have been receiving do not seem to be up to date. What should Wanda do next?
Refer them to the steering committee for updates.
Assign a project team member to update the reports.
Refer to the information radiators for her project.
Your answer is correct
Confirm the version number of the reports they have.
Overall explanation
Wanda should first confirm what specific report or version they are using. This will help her troubleshoot what is happening. Status reports should use a version number, often written as a date, to help identify and communicate project status. It is possible that the stakeholders do not have the current status report or that Wanda has not issued them updates. Information radiators may not be the best option in this case as there is no evidence an information radiator exists or that Wanda is utilizing an agile project. Assigning a project team member to assist the stakeholders is not ideal as Wanda does not know exactly which report the stakeholders have. The first thing to do is to confirm the most recent status reports the stakeholders have received, then rectify the problem. The steering committee is not used for providing updates, so this choice is incorrect.

As the project manager of the KEY Project, Valarie is using an agile approach to the project. The development team and the product owner are discussing the size of the user stories for the upcoming sprint. The top requirement has been sized at 35 user stories, and the team's velocity is 22. What is the best course of action for this requirement?
Increase the velocity
Add more team members
Your answer is correct
Slice the story
Resize the story
Overall explanation
The best answer is to slice the story into smaller requirements so the team can complete a portion in the next sprint. Slicing stories means the requirement is broken into multiple stories and distributed across two iterations. The team's velocity cannot increase; it is the average number of story points completed per iteration. Adding more team members is not the best solution. Adding team members can be disruptive in the middle of the project. Resizing the story is not the best choice, as resizing the story does not change the amount of effort needed to complete the work.

After listening to various requirements, Wendy recommends that overall planning be performed in advance while specifics are handled in an agile manner. The project stakeholders do not understand the agile approach, and Wanda's proposal for a hybrid method has them confused. What component of agile would benefit the stakeholders the most in this project?
Easy to change scope
Your answer is correct
Prioritized product backlog
Flexibility in requirements
Lower costs for the project work
Overall explanation
The benefit for the stakeholders in this approach is utilizing a prioritized product backlog. This helps the stakeholders realize business value faster by delivering the product's most important features and functions first. There may be flexibility in the requirements, but this is not the biggest benefit for the scenario. It may be easy to change the scope, but the best benefit is realizing business value quickly in the scenario. Lower costs are not necessarily true with this scenario or with agile, predictive, or hybrid.

Communication is a large part of project management and project managers must be communicators. When considering virtual teams, you will need additional skills to be an effective communicator. What is the best communication tool to engage a virtual team?
Correct answer
Hosting web conferencing software meetings.
Emailing important notices.
Instant messaging team members daily.
Your answer is incorrect
A team blog that all team members can contribute to that contains team information.
Overall explanation
The most engaging communication method for a virtual team is web conferencing software, which allows team members to speak in real-time and hear and see their teammates in some cases. A team blog does not allow for real-time communication and is a form of pull communication. While instant messaging is great for quick responses, it is still not always real-time and does not allow for the personalization that a web conferencing software would provide. Emailing important notices may be effective for ensuring that messages are sent, but you lose the face-to-face communication and feedback that web conferencing software offers.

Isabella is the project manager of the HGHW Project, which is in its planning stages and is expected to last twelve months. The project is government-funded and has many compliance and documentation requirements, which Isabella has not worked with before. The compliance requires accurate information on materials, results, and time spent on project work portions. What should Isabella do?
Obtain a knowledge management system.
Secure a compliance manager on the project team to handle the documentation.
Your answer is correct
Assign clear roles on the team for managing documentation.
Hire a knowledge manager.
Overall explanation
Isabella should ensure the team clearly understands how the documentation will be handled on the project. Compliance in government-funded projects often requires detailed documentation from team members, so it is best to identify roles and responsibilities in the project. A knowledge management system may be useful, but without clear roles, it will not be effective. A specialized knowledge manager may not be necessary if the team clearly understands what to do. A compliance manager will detail what the compliance is but may not be the person doing the actual documentation. Team members need roles and responsibilities to complete their assignments and be in compliance.

Your answer is correct
Review the stakeholder engagement plan
Overall explanation
The best choice is to review the stakeholder engagement plan to determine the validity of the stakeholder and their concerns in the project. The communications management plan defines who needs what information, when it is needed, and the expected modality. This is a good second choice, but the stakeholder engagement plan is the best option presented. The risk management plan is not the best choice as there is not a clear risk in the scenario as the team reports the task is on track for completion. The project scope review is not the best choice presented; Elizabeth should review the stakeholder engagement plan.

Details for change implementation are required for integrated change control. There is no reason to make a change without evidence for the needed change. Although risk assessment is needed for change, it is an incorrect answer because some changes may be tossed aside for other reasons than risk.

Which listed agile meeting would be appropriate to conduct this demo?
Deliverables meeting
Your answer is correct
Sprint review
Daily standup meeting
Retrospective meeting
Overall explanation
After each iteration, the agile project team will demonstrate a potentially shippable product increment to the project stakeholders. This occurs during an iteration review meeting, which in scrum is called the sprint review. During the review, the agile project team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the concluded iteration. Based on this information, they will add any changes to the backlog during the iteration, and attendees collaborate on the following things that can be done to optimize value. The daily standup meeting, called the daily scrum, is a short (usually 15-minute) time-boxed event for the development team to inspect progress toward the iteration goal and plan work for the next twenty-four hours. A retrospective is an opportunity for the project team to inspect itself and create consensus for improvements to be enacted during future iterations.

You and your team must plan for regulatory compliance requirements that the organization has for their banking projects. In addition, compliance at JL Consulting is enforced through the project management office, though you must lead the compliance efforts in the project. What kind of project management office are you most likely operating within?
Your answer is correct
Controlling
Supportive
Regulatory
Primary
Overall explanation
A controlling PMO has a high degree of authority and control over the project. A controlling PMO ensures compliance with organizational requirements. Supportive PMOs have moderate control over projects and offer more guidance, support, forms, templates, and software. Regulatory is not a valid project management term, so this choice is incorrect. Primary PMO is not a valid project management term, so this choice is incorrect.

Question 70
Incorrect
Agile models should most likely include
Your answer is incorrect
None of the above, as models are far too detailed to be included in an agile project.
Fully functional prototypes and data dictionaries.
A detailed diagram of the exact look and feel desired on each screen.
Correct answer
Use case diagrams and screen mock-ups.
Overall explanation
This is the only accurate answer for appropriate agile models. Use case diagrams and screen mock-ups can provide a good overview without being too detailed or taking too much time. Anything detailed and exact is not usually part of agile, including prototypes and data dictionaries. There is also no restriction from using models that are simple and take little time.

Diane wants to ensure that her team at Bronn’s Ponds is on the same page regarding the look and feel of their software project. She wants to show what each screen looks like and how they flow between each other. Her best agile tool is
A persona
Correct answer
A wireframe
Your answer is incorrect
A process flow diagram
A data model
Overall explanation
A wireframe’s intent is to focus on the look and flow between screens and is the correct answer. A process flow diagram does not include what the screens look like and is an incorrect answer. A data model does not include any of the requirements listed and is an incorrect answer. A persona does not include any of the requirements listed and is an incorrect answer.

Question 72
Correct
The approach that Emily’s team takes for software at Kitchen Tables International is as follows. The development work is finished, reviewed as part of paired programming, and marked complete. Once complete, the testing team picks it up a few days later, as they are working on two projects simultaneously. After testing, they discuss any issues with the developer, which are corrected before it is considered done. How should this process be changed to minimize waste?
Your answer is correct
The delay waiting for the testing team should be removed.
The delay in updating the team daily on the status should be removed.
The delay associated with discussing issues during the test cycle should be removed.
The delay associated with paired programming should be removed.
Overall explanation
Waiting is considered waste, so the delay in testing these items should be removed. Paired programming is a benefit, not a waste. B And C are incorrect because the discussion of issues and discussing status daily are not considered waste either as they are critical steps. It is not a required step to wait.

Question 73
Incorrect
You are the project manager for a new agile project. Agile is a new approach for your organization, so you are doing a lot of coaching on the agile mindset. During scope definition, Robert, the chief executive officer, and stakeholder, demands that the project obtains customer satisfaction to be successful. What is the danger of this request?
Your answer is incorrect
Customer satisfaction is achieved only through measurable quality control metrics.
Correct answer
Customer satisfaction is not quantifiable.
Customer satisfaction is not known until the customer has paid for the project.
Customer satisfaction is never achieved through projects but through operations.
Overall explanation
Customer satisfaction is not quantifiable is the best choice because customer satisfaction is not a quantifiable metric. In agile, you need to know the Definition of Done rather than lofty goals that are not measurable. Customer satisfaction is a goal of every project. However, customer satisfaction is not a quantifiable goal for the project and has nothing to do with receiving payment. The metrics in themselves do not achieve customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction can be achieved through successful project implementations. Operations, however, are the ongoing efforts involved in keeping a business going.

Fiona is the project manager for Project QP, which is in its ninth week of development, has a TCPI of 1.01, and is on budget. Recently Fiona noted that one stakeholder constantly fails to attend meetings but seems updated on Project QP's status. What should Fiona do next?
Complain to the steering committee.
Do nothing. The stakeholder is updated.
Your answer is incorrect
Assign a team member to speak to the stakeholder.
Correct answer
Speak with the stakeholder and determine if they want to be in the meetings.
Overall explanation
Fiona should speak with the stakeholder to determine their needs are being met and then adjust accordingly. Doing nothing risks this stakeholder having unmet needs. Assigning a team member to speak with the stakeholder is not ideal. The steering committee is unlikely to be able to assist in this scenario.

Abbas is the project manager for the Jefferson Project, designing and implementing a new application that connects to a database server. Management has asked him to create a method to document the project's technical direction and any changes or enhancements of the project deliverable's technical attributes. Of the following, which one will satisfy the management's request?
Correct answer
Configuration management
Scope control
Change management plan
Your answer is incorrect
Integrated change control
Overall explanation
Configuration management is the correct answer, defined as documenting the project's product, its traits, and product changes. A change management plan is incorrect because it does not describe the product, its features, or changes. Scope control is incorrect because it details how to manage changes or potential changes. Integrated change control is incorrect because it describes incorporating all project changes across the areas of knowledge.

Twila is the scrum master for Project D, which is 6 iterations into deployment and has a velocity of 65 story points. During a recent retrospective, her team discovered they are missing critical skills to complete Project D and would like to call in a vendor for support. What should Twila do next?
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Draft a statement of work.
Your answer is incorrect
Hold a bidders conference.
Correct answer
Determine exactly what work would be contracted out.
Overall explanation
Before taking any other action, Twila should be sure she has complete requirements on what work is needed. This will allow her to find the best solution. A statement of work is a document a seller provides a bidder outlining what they will do. A bidders conference is when multiple bidders are invited to meet and learn about a project.

Oscar is the scrum master for Project X, which is in its fifth iteration. Recently several members of his team were sent to a specialized training camp to improve their skills. How can Oscar best determine if their training was successful?
By checking their exam scores
By asking them how training went
Your answer is correct
By tracking how their performance improves
By asking their managers
Overall explanation
Oscar can track their performance to determine how their training went. Getting a high exam score is not the best answer as the question does not reveal if there is even an exam. In addition, exam scores do not always correlate to project performance. Asking for feedback is fine, but the real evidence of successful training is how the skills are applied in the project work. Managers are not likely to know how the training actually went for the attendees.

Beth is a scrum master at Acme Corporation and has been tasked with planning Project X. Beth is concerned that the product owner does not fully understand the project's scope. Because of this, the PO has suggested a project team that is insufficient to meet project demands. What should Beth do next?
Tell the product owner they chose a poor team.
Collaborate with the product owner to find a better team.
Complain to her project management office about the product owner.
Your answer is correct
Review the overall project goals to determine what skills the team should have.
Overall explanation
Beth should first understand what the project needs to do and what skills are required to achieve those goals. Once she has this information, she will be able to meet resourcing requirements. Telling the product owner that they chose poorly will not help properly resource the team and risks alienating the product owner. Complaining to the project management office will not help Beth properly resource her project. Until she has identified resourcing needs, Beth will not be able to find a better team.

Jo is the project manager for Project HAL, deploying a new help center software to support ticketing agents. While reviewing the project plan, Jo notices that the project team does not directly interact with any ticketing agents. Ticketing agents take the incoming calls from the end-users. Why would Jo think this is a problem?
Your answer is incorrect
The ticketing agents are the product owners.
The project team should use the same equipment as the ticketing agents.
The steering committee asked Jo to co-locate his team and the ticketing agents.
Correct answer
This makes knowledge transfer more challenging.
Overall explanation
Any knowledge transfer between the two teams will be impossible without direct contact between the project team and the ticketing agents. Jo should set up some recurring meetings with a few agents and team members to ensure knowledge flows between the two groups, which would help the project team better understand the needs and application of the ticketing agents. The ticketing agents are not product owners; they are stakeholders of Project HAL. The project team does not have to use the same equipment but may need access to it to perform testing. It is unlikely Jo was asked to co-locate his team with the ticketing agents.

You are the project manager for your organization, leading a predictive project to create a new software application. In managing this software development project, you realize that your project is slipping behind schedule. There is a bottleneck in the project, waiting for specific tasks to be completed by three key developers. Funds are running low in the budget, but some scheduled activities are able to be completed in differing orders. What is the best option for getting this project back on schedule?
The project cannot get back on schedule without extra funding for hiring.
Cut scope out of the project.
Hire more software developers.
Your answer is correct
Fast-track some of the activities.
Overall explanation
You should fast-track some of the activities. Fast-tracking allows some activities to be completed in parallel where you would typically do them sequentially. Fast-tracking assumes some risks, and you must have workers available to do the tasks. In this scenario, funds are low, not allowing you to hire more developers, a process known as crashing. It would not be the best choice to cut the scope out of the project. Instead, it would be best to mitigate the problem by fast-tracking some of the activities. The project can be brought back on schedule if activities are fast-tracked. Hiring more software developers is not possible as the funds are already low, so this choice is incorrect.

A Project Management Skills Gap Assessment (PM SGA) was recently conducted on an application development start-up business that wants to provide an innovative service for its clients. However, the employees are unsure about presenting the executive team's ideas to their customers, leading to a loss of profit margins from poor customer service. Which of the following type of organization best describes the organization shown above?
Management by memo organization
Correct answer
The blind leading the blind
Your answer is incorrect
Seat of the pants project management
Working towards best in class
Overall explanation
The organization is best described as the blind leading the blind, which means they have low competency and capability. When individuals and organizations are weak in their efforts, they may have the passion but not the executive team's direction. In this scenario, the management team wants to provide an innovative service but cannot effectively convey their vision to the front-line employees. In turn, the employees are unable to present their ideas to the clients. Working towards best in class – High Competency and Capability describes a coordinated effort of individuals possessing strong skills and a supportive organization that yields an oath that drives towards continuous improvement and monitored change. Seat of the pants project management – High Competency and Low Capability describes a purely reactionary organization, and its members function in the "just get it done" mantra. Management by memo organization – Low Competency and High Capability describes a dictatorial and functional independent organization. The organization drives all commands and edicts down to the masses since they "know" better.

Jada is the project manager for her organization and is serving as a coach and mentor for multiple junior project managers. With her project team, she is currently reviewing the inputs for stakeholder engagement monitoring. Some of the inputs essential to stakeholder engagement monitoring are confusing to Jada’s team members. How does the issue log, one of the inputs to monitoring stakeholder engagement, help Jada prepare to monitor stakeholder engagement?
Your answer is incorrect
The issue log helps discern which stakeholders are causing the project’s issues.
Correct answer
The issue log assists in communicating the status of issues and helps track and respond to issues
Only when issues are defined by the stakeholders are issue logs needed.
This is not true; the issue log is not an input to stakeholder engagement monitoring.
Overall explanation
Once an issue exists, the project manager needs to put it in the issue log and then work to resolve the issue. The issue log is used as part of stakeholder engagement to resolve conflicts and communicate with stakeholders; stakeholders will always be affected by issues. Issues happen that are not the stakeholders’ fault – consider how a natural disaster like a tornado or hurricane could affect a project and its stakeholders. Use of the issue log will not be initiated by stakeholders; it is the project manager’s duty to bring the issue log into stakeholder engagement and conflict resolution. While the issue log is an input to stakeholder engagement, it is not typically used to identify stakeholders who are causing issues.

You are the project manager of a software development project. Ripal is the technical architect for your software development team. He informs you that there is a new update to a universal coding language. The update to the coding language is used throughout the industry and heavily in the team's current project. What should you do next?
Correct answer
Instruct Ripal to inform other technical contributors of this change.
Submit a change request to refactor the codebase into this new coding language.
Instruct Ripal to schedule a training session for the entire organization.
Your answer is incorrect
Bring this up in the planning stage of the next technical project.
Overall explanation
Ripal should inform the other technical contributors of this change. Knowledge transfer is critical, and this information may impact all technical contributors. Hosting a training session for the entire organization is unnecessary, as this information will impact only technical stakeholders. Submitting a change request to refactor the codebase may be required; however, it is unknown if this is necessary without proper analysis. Bringing this up in the next project is a good idea; however, it should be done as quickly as possible as there may be impacts on the existing project.

Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Speak to the team member's manager.
Remove that team member from Project V.
Your answer is correct

Overall explanation
Before taking any action, Kelli should investigate the root cause of the failure. This will allow her to take the most appropriate subsequent response. Without understanding what happened, removing the team member may not be the best solution for the question, the project, or the team's morale. Speaking to the team member's manager will not help Kelli understand the issue's root cause. The steering committee is unlikely to help in this scenario and will expect the project manager to resolve the situation.

She is worried about falling behind schedule, so she decides to bring on some extra staff to ensure that the project is not late. This is an example of
Correct answer
Crashing
Your answer is incorrect
Fast-tracking 
Resource leveling
Resource smoothing
Overall explanation
This is an example of crashing. Crashing refers to adding resources to compress the schedule. Crashing adds labor but also increases the project costs as you must pay for the added workers. Resource leveling levels the number of hours an employee can work on the project during a time period, for example, six hours per workday. This approach extends the project schedule. Resource smoothing, like resource leveling, flattens the amount of time a worker can work on tasks, but is usually only done on activities that are not on the critical path. This approach extends the project schedule. This is not an example of fast-tracking because fast-tracking means that tasks are done in parallel. Fast-tracking is often done in large projects and allows phases to overlap. Fast-tracking increases risk.

The faucets are rusting after less than a year of use. To identify the cause of the problem, which tool should Mohammed and his team use?
Your answer is correct
Ishikawa diagram

Experimental design
Overall explanation
The correct answer is to use an Ishikawa diagram. This diagram is a system of tools that identifies all possible causes of problems and puts them in a graphic format. Muhammed and his team must be able to identify the reasons for the quality issue in the first place to move forward in the process of rectifying the problem. An Ishikawa diagram will allow the team to identify the possible causes and move forward with solving the issues so that they do not continue. Flowcharts show the flow of information through a system or process. Experimental design is an agile process to experiment for the best way forward in the project. Statistical sampling takes a sample from the pool of products to measure for quality as a reflection on the quality of the entire completed products.

Include the stakeholder in more project meetings.
Your answer is correct
More closely monitor for risks and communicate project status.
Assign a team member to meet with the stakeholder daily.
Ask the project sponsor to speak with the stakeholder.
Overall explanation
Frank could have kept a closer eye on the project to identify potential risks, which would have allowed him to catch and resolve these risks before they became an issue. Or, if the risks did look likely to happen, better communicate with the stakeholders about the delay. Including the stakeholder in more meetings would not help Frank identify the risks. Having a team member meet with the stakeholders would not help Frank identify the risks. Asking the project sponsor to speak with the stakeholder would not have uncovered the risks.

The project management office requires this poll.
State regulations require the poll.
Overall explanation
Having a comfortable working environment free of distractions and helping the team focus will result in a happier team and better productivity. If Roger has the authority to act on the team's working style and environment, he should do so. The project management office requiring a poll is not typical. State regulations requiring a poll are highly unlikely. Canceling the poll is not a valid answer as it would prevent Roger from optimizing his team's working environment.

The work that American Metal Group is responsible for needs to start right away. What might you do to start the work on time?
Your answer is incorrect
Send American Metal Group a waiver to sign so that they can start working.
Correct answer
Issue a letter of intent with American Metal Group so that they can start working.
Wait till the contract is signed, as it is too risky to work without a contract.
Try to find a new vendor to work with to perform this work.
Overall explanation
You should issue a letter of intent so the firm can start working. A letter of intent is used precisely for situations such as this. When it takes time for contracts to be signed, letters of intent can be used to start working without a contract. A letter of intent ensures that a contract will be signed as soon as possible. It would be best if you did not wait for the contract to be signed as this option could take a long time and delay the project. If the work required is already approaching, you should try to move along as planned while still protecting both the buyer and the seller. It would not be best to try to find a new vendor, as this option could take a long time and there is no indication that there is anything wrong with the chosen vendor. If the work required is already approaching, you should try to move along as planned while still protecting both the buyer and the seller. American Metal Group does not need a waiver.

The labor cost for each room is calculated at $650 per room. Lola's project sponsor states that he disagrees with her labor estimate. Of the following choices, which best describes why Lola's project sponsor disagrees with her labor estimate?
Correct answer
The learning curve has not been considered.
Your answer is incorrect
Lola has not considered the law of diminishing returns.
Because Lola has not completed one hotel room yet, she cannot know how long the work will truly take.
Lola has not factored in all the effort applied to the work.
Overall explanation
The consideration of the learning curve is the best answer here. As the team finishes more and more units, completing a room should take less and less time. The law of diminishing returns is not reflective of the learning curve and is incorrect. As more work gets done, the more efficient the project team becomes. The lack of factoring in the effort is incorrect because it does not reflect the learning curve - as more work gets done, the more efficient the project team becomes. This response is incorrect because it does not reflect the learning curve -as more work is completed, the more efficient the project team becomes.

Defining roles and responsibilities
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Your answer is correct

Capturing and emphasizing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices. Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations.

The client states that some deliverables do not correlate to what was agreed upon early in the project. The project manager and team review the terms in the contract and believe they have met all the requirements. However, the project manager consults with the project management organization to determine what may have gone wrong. Upon review, the PMO determines that the team did not validate the project scope. What could the project manager have done differently to avoid this issue?
Your answer is incorrect

Assess the company's culture and systems.
Determine the client's culture and existing systems.
Correct answer
Confirm the project scope statement.
Overall explanation
If the validate scope process had been completed correctly, the client would have agreed upon the deliverables. Reviewing the business case happens before the project is initiated, and the project scope is often based on the details of the business case. The client’s culture and existing systems are part of the project’s planning for scope and stakeholder engagement, so this choice is incorrect.

Create a detailed lessons learned document.
View the next project as entirely new.
He can do nothing since he is losing most of his team.
Ask key members of the team to stay permanently.
Overall explanation
A detailed lessons learned document will help Hogan ramp up the new project team and they can learn from the mistakes and challenges of the previous project. Doing nothing is rarely a good choice. Hogan can take action to address the issue of the team changing. Asking key members to stay on his project is not a viable solution as they have already been assigned to a different project. In addition, even if a few key members stayed on, Hogan would need to coach the new team members on the challenges and how they were overcome. Whenever there is historical information to rely upon, you should use it. Treating the new project as entirely new and ignoring past information is not helpful to the project.

Sara is a scrum master for Project Lexicon, which just completed its initial planning and is ready to begin the project work. To ensure the team knows who will be doing what, Sara has called a meeting to review some critical pieces of project documentation. What is Sara most likely to discuss?
Your answer is correct
The team's roles and responsibilities.
Which stakeholders are most important.
The team's reporting structure.
The project's schedule.
Overall explanation
To ensure the team knows who is responsible, Sara will likely go over the team's roles, and responsibilities which helps everyone on the project team understand who will do what, swim lanes, and expectations for the project. The team's reporting structure is useful but will not help them understand roles and responsibilities. In this meeting, roles and responsibilities are most likely to be discussed.

Question 105
Correct
Kyle is a project manager for IT Humanities Organization and was assigned to a new project to build racing drones for a client. During the individual assessments for Kyle's team members, it was determined that John excelled at aerodynamics but scored low in communication abilities. Jill scored high in aerodynamics and communication. The other four team members did not score very high on aerodynamics. Based on this assessment, Kyle should do which of the following?
Build a team silo and put John and Jill on the same team working on the same tasks.
Try to find a replacement for John regardless of his ability in aerodynamics.
Your answer is correct
Add Jill and John to the team as normal and monitor John's progress closely since he scored low on communication.
Build a team silo and put John and Jill on the same team placing Jill in charge of John.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to add both Jill and John as usual and monitor John's progress. A low score in communication does not mean that John is incapable of communicating. Since the project is to build a racing drone, you will need the technical skill of aerodynamics, and as the project manager, Kyle should be able to help John develop his communication skills if required. Team silos are not the best option; in addition, there is little reason for Jill to oversee John. There is no reason evident why John and Jill should work on the same tasks. Finding a replacement for a team member, in most cases, is not the best first option. The exception may be if a team member is so disruptive that it hinders the project's success.

Carlton has been promoted from project manager to director. He is now directly responsible for a team of project managers and indirectly responsible for their direct reports. To ensure that all his employees can work to their full capacity, Carlton schedules weekly check-ins with his project managers and checks that they have the necessary resources, including funding, employees, and technology, to work efficiently and continuously. Which quality management practice does this entail?
Your answer is incorrect
Continual improvement
Correct answer
Management responsibility
Customer satisfaction
Mutually beneficial partnerships
Overall explanation
Management responsibility refers to management's responsibility for providing the necessary resources for their teams to provide quality. Continual improvement emerges from a cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting (PDCA) as a way of iteratively improving quality. Customer satisfaction involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer needs. Mutually beneficial partnerships are mutually beneficial relationships in which one organization or actor creates value for another, a pattern that is repeated iteratively to form a positive feedback loop.

Question 108

You are the scrum master of a software development project that has recently launched. One of your team members has just left the organization, and Adam has been assigned as a replacement. Adam has not worked with scrum before but is an excellent developer on your team. Adam approaches you with some requirements that he thinks should be added to the software solution, but he is uncertain how to make a change request in the scrum project. You explain that the product owner can take the requirements, determine if they are needed, and add them to the product backlog. Adam wants to know how the product owner will determine when the items will be incorporated into the solution. Which one of the following choices would be the best answer?
Risk impact or risk probability
Cost-benefit ratio or customer value
Correct answer
Expected Monetary Value (EMV) or business value
Your answer is incorrect
Risk mitigation impact or user impact
Overall explanation
Stories are prioritized in agile projects based on their expected monetary value (EMV) and features based on their business value. Risk impact or risk probability may be a good second choice based on the risk-adjusted product backlog. However, the business value is always the best decision in a scenario like this. Cost-benefit ratios are not typically utilized in prioritizing the product backlog, though customer value, or business value, always is. Risk mitigation impact or user impact is not a great choice as mitigation is an effort to reduce or lower the risk and is a risk response, not a ranking of the requirements in the project.

Which of the following is not a direct result of emotional intelligence?
Your answer is correct
Increased productivity within the team.
Increased trust within the team.
Increased cooperation within the team.
Reduced tension within the team.
Overall explanation
Emotional intelligence does not directly result in increased productivity. While productivity may increase tangentially through emotional intelligence, it is not a direct result. Reduced tension within the team is a result of emotional intelligence. Increased cooperation within the team is a result of emotional intelligence. Increased trust within the team is a result of emotional intelligence.

Tim is a scrum master with Project B. He is concerned his development team did not take on enough tasks for a particular sprint. He has asked the development team, and they feel they are progressing at an acceptable pace. How can Tim prove or disprove the development team's report?
Tim should sit with the project team to directly observe their progress.
Your answer is incorrect
The development team is closest to the work, and Tim should take them for their word.
Tim should review each team member's time cards to determine their hours worked.
Correct answer
Tim should review the team's velocity and compare that to sprint progress.
Overall explanation
The team's velocity will inform Tim how much work the development team can perform in any given sprint. Comparing this to their current progress will explain how well they are progressing, regardless of the number of tasks being worked on in the project. The development team may be closest to the work. However, velocity is an objective way to measure what can be accomplished. The amount of time worked does not necessarily equate to the amount of work accomplished. Sitting directly with the team will only distract them from working and not provide the information Tim needs.

Simon has a fleet of cars that he uses to transport high-profile clients to and from their destinations. One of his clients is extremely polarizing, and fans are known to swarm her vehicle to see her. A recent press in several out-of-town newspapers announces his client's imminent arrival. Concerned about potential damage to his vehicles, Simon increased his insurance premiums to get better coverage. Which risk management option does this represent?
Avoid
Mitigate
Escalate
Your answer is correct
Transference
Overall explanation
Transference entails moving the risk to another party, often a neutral third party like an insurer, to negate or minimize the impact of a realized risk. Escalation occurs when the scope is beyond the project's original parameters, or the required response would exceed the project manager's authority. Avoidance occurs when a team works to eliminate a threat or otherwise protect a project from risk. Mitigation requires action to reduce the probability or impact of a risk.

You are the project manager with over ten years of experience at a major engineering company. Your supervisor has requested that you select one individual you have worked with on previous projects and mentor them for a prospective project management role. Although you are excited at the prospect of having a protégé, you are only familiar with providing coaching sessions, not mentoring. Which of the following characteristics defines mentoring?
Your answer is incorrect
Goal setting
Correct answer
Counseling
Teaching
Providing feedback
Overall explanation
Mentoring is more concerned with modeling, counseling, supporting, advocating, introducing, and sheltering. Coaching is more concerned with goal setting, providing practical application, providing feedback, and teaching. Goal setting is focused on the individual, the project manager, or another supervisor creating performance-based goals in the organization. Providing feedback is part of the project manager and management's responsibility but does little to mentor the individual. Teaching is an attribute more closely aligned with coaching rather than mentoring.

The coders and developers on the team are experienced but have not learned some newer coding languages and disciplines. What should Killian do with his project team?
Fire the team and hire younger coders and developers.

Assess the team's skillset collectively and individually.
Nothing, the team is already ahead of the curve by utilizing agile.
Teach them scrum.
Overall explanation
This team is a good one, but everyone needs to brush up on their skills and tactics from time to time. Killian should assess the team and look for the most glaring things the team should catch up on, and he should work to assess and refresh the team.

Your answer is correct
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Stage-gate or phase reviews
Defining roles and responsibilities
Capturing lessons learned
Overall explanation
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations. Capturing and emphasizing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices.

As a project manager for her organization Raquel is leading a technical installation project. In this strong matrix structure, her organization is using decentralized contracting. The project management office has instructed Raquel only to arrange contracts with vendors that pose a low risk for her firm. What type of contract should Raquel use?
Cost contract
Cost-reimbursable contract
Your answer is incorrect
Time and materials contract
Correct answer
Fixed-price contract
Overall explanation
Raquel should use a fixed-price contract. Fixed-price contracts pose the least amount of risk for the buyer because the seller would bear any additional costs. A time and materials contract is not a low risk for the buyer because, under a time and materials contract, the buyer is responsible for the cost behind any unplanned materials. Cost-reimbursable contracts, sometimes called 'cost plus' contracts, assign the risk of cost overruns to the buyer. Cost contract is not a valid contract type for the project management exam, so this choice is incorrect.

Question 120
Incorrect
You are the project manager on a project where a business analyst is not comfortable with your work ethic. He feels that you should be doing more to help him gather the project requirements since there are over 900 project requirements. Instead of coming to you to discuss his feelings about your work ethic, he goes to your supervisor to complain. What do you do to resolve the conflict between you and the business analyst to assure your supervisor that the conflict between you and the business analyst will not impact the project?
Ask to be assigned to another project as you feel the business analyst should have come to you first to discuss why they thought you were not doing your job to assist them with gathering the requirements.
Your answer is incorrect
Schedule a meeting with the business analyst and your supervisor to discuss the conflict.
Correct answer
Invite the business analyst to coffee to discuss why they feel you are not carrying your weight on the project. Determine if there is anything you could do to assist them with gathering the requirements.
Inform your supervisor that the business analyst is not equipped to do their job, and you would like to request that another business analyst replace him on the project.
Overall explanation
Inviting the business analyst to coffee to determine why they feel you are not carrying your weight is the best approach to resolving the conflict. This opens the conversation and allows you both to understand each other's position and expectations. There is no clear reason that the business analyst should be replaced or not doing their job. Schedule a meeting with the business analyst and your supervisor to discuss the conflict; while it may escalate to this point, the best choice presented is to confront the problem to discuss the issue like professionals. Asking to be assigned to another project is not the best choice as you need to tackle this challenge and live up to the expectations management has set for you.

Allen must start his new construction project in Florida right away as hurricane season is fast approaching, and he is on a very tight deadline. Allen needs to hire a vendor for a portion of the construction work. This part of the work should not take long to complete but needs to be completed before other activities move forward. Of the following choices, which type of contract should Allen use?
Your answer is incorrect
Fixed-price contract
Correct answer
Time and materials contract
Cost-reimbursable contract
Cost-plus incentive fee contract
Overall explanation
Allen should use a time and materials contract. A time and materials contract is best for work that must begin right away. These contract types are ideal for smaller procured work, but they need a "not to exceed" clause that serves as a cap on the cost of the work. Ordinarily, Allen would want to use a fixed-price contract, but because there is such a sense of urgency, Allen needs to use a time and materials contract. A cost-reimbursable contract assigns risk to the buyer for cost overruns and is rarely used. A cost-plus incentive fee assigns the cost overruns to the buyer but does offer an incentive fee, or bonus, for conditions within the project. This type of contract might be used for larger project work, but not usually for smaller assignments as described in this question.

As an agile team leader, Bianca involves the entire team when problem-solving. This sends what sort of message to the team?
The team leader does not trust one team member's solution.
The team leader doubts that the business partners have a resolution.
The team leader does not know the solution.
Your answer is correct
According to the team leader, members are capable of being supportive beyond their roles.
Overall explanation
Because agile teams work so closely, they are more likely to suggest ideas to one another. The message is sent to the entire team that they are not pigeonholed to be solely a tester, coder, or developer when they are involved in resolving problems. An agile team leader involves the whole team in problem-solving, not just one person or business partner or themselves. When an agile leader asks for input, it is not because they do not know what to do; they show the team that their ideas and solutions are valued. The engagement of the entire team is an agile methodology.

Within two weeks, Mike notices that there has been a high turnover rate for team members during the project. To accommodate these changes, Mike explores agile methodologies. What action should Mike take to shift to a hybrid approach?
Remove the number of team members down to nine individuals, plus or minus two.
Ensure the organization can continue funding the project.
Review a historically similar project to determine the current project's feasibility.
Your answer is correct

Overall explanation
Mike should review the benefits of incorporating agile practices. This action will ensure the requirements are defined and that the team can adjust to changing requirements through continuous feedback and delivery. No two projects are exactly alike, and many external factors will need to be considered. While continuing to fund the project is very important, it does not directly answer a hybrid approach. The ideal team size for an agile project management team is between 5 and 9 people.

Correct answer
A guide to all future project decisions
Based on the CCB, a fluid document that is updated as needed
Your answer is incorrect
A method to approve or decline CCB changes
A project deliverables vision
Overall explanation
The correct answer is the project plan provides a guide to all decisions made in the future. While a fluid document that is updated as needed is included in the project plan, it is not the best answer here. A CCB (change control board) may approve or decline changes. This response is incorrect because a project plan gives more information than just approving or denying changes. The project plan does not just describe the project vision, but it details how to obtain the vision.

The project manager has performed stakeholder analysis by learning stakeholder requirements and making recommendations to fulfill those requirements. Stakeholder analysis is part of stakeholder management and an essential technique for stakeholder identification and their needs. Scope validation is a control function related to gain customer acceptance of deliverables. Integrated change control relates to looking for multiple impacts of changes. Scope planning creates a scope management plan.

Project float
Correct answer
Total float
Your answer is incorrect
Lead
Free float
Overall explanation
This task has total float. Total float refers to a task with room to be delayed without impacting the project's target completion date or milestone. This is not free float because free float refers to a delay between two tasks. This example explicitly references the milestone delivery date, not a task. Project float refers to how much a task can be delayed before impacting the customer. Because the example references a milestone date, this would not necessarily impact the customer.

Adaptability increases over time.
Overall explanation
Risk decreases throughout an agile project relatively steadily, and a traditional project experiences little decrease in risk until the project is finished.

Frances has recently joined an educational software company, and he is new to agile development. To develop his skills as an agile project manager, he has reached out to his mentor, who is highly skilled at agile and is wondering how to develop an accurate schedule for his project. His mentor suggests on-demand scheduling as an appropriate technique in software development projects. What does on-demand scheduling rely on?
Skills of the project manager alone
Your answer is correct
A prioritized product backlog
Dependencies that are on the critical path
A predetermined schedule based on stakeholders' requirements
Overall explanation
On-demand scheduling is based on a pull system, where the development team chooses work from a backlog or queue, and work is implemented as resources become available. On-demand scheduling is based on a pull system, not a command-and-control solution of the project manager. A predetermined schedule based on stakeholders' requirements is not a valid statement as requirements will change throughout the project, so a predetermined path is not likely to succeed in agile. Agile does not use a critical path methodology, so this choice is incorrect.

Your project is wrapping up and is over budget. Most of the project was contracted out to LS Building, a reputable engineering consulting group. Your contract with them was a fixed-price incentive fee contract. The target cost for the project was $6,000,000. LS Building stipulated a target fee of $40,000. The contract's target price was initially $6,500,000. The contract's sharing ratio was 60% to the buyer and 40% to the seller, and the ceiling price was $7,000,000. Calculate the point of total assumption.
$7,250,000.00
Your answer is incorrect
$2,800,000.00
$500,000.00
Correct answer
$6,833,333.33
Overall explanation
The point of total assumption is calculated by subtracting the target price from the ceiling price ($7,000,000.00- $6,500,000.00 = $500,000.00). This value is then divided by the buyers share ratio ($500,000.00/ .6 = $833,333.33). Add this value to the target cost ($833,333.33 + $6,000,000.00 = $6,833,333.33). $7,250,000.00 is not a valid calculation of the point of total assumption. $500,000.00 is not a valid calculation of the point of total assumption. $2,800,000.00 is not a valid calculation of the point of total assumption.

Doris is a new scrum master at a major healthcare facility in Florida. She receives an assignment to a scrum team that has been newly formed to develop a software solution that will support the hospital's work. The project team is not familiar with the Scrum methodology. They are resentful because they feel the hospital is forcing them to follow an agile methodology, which they have not had the training to perform. As the new scrum master, what do you do to bring your team together?
Your answer is correct
Discuss the issue with the team and ask them what steps they can take to resolve the issue.
Ask your manager if she can arrange to give the project team scrum training to improve their skill set.
Ask to be reassigned to a project team with resources and skillsets needed to perform the project's work.
Determine if management will allow for added resources with a scrum skill set to the project team.
Overall explanation
Discussing the team's issue and coming up with a solution as a group helps reduce conflict and build team collaboration to find a solution. While training for the team is a great idea, it is best to use the agile approach of coaching the team to get their opinion and viewpoint on how best to move forward. Lead the team to a decision rather than forcing another decision on the team. Adding people with scrum skills does not resolve the issue for the current team. Moving from the project to a different team is not embracing the agile mindset or servant leadership.

Question 137
Incorrect
Joseph has properly incorporated the agile principle of building projects around motivated team members, and he trusts them to get their work done. Which of these scenarios did he implement?
Joseph provides an assignment list of each cycle of the work to be completed, so the team can pick how they would like to handle those assignments.
Your answer is incorrect
Joseph has implemented the best processes and tools to ensure that the team can keep everyone informed regarding their daily progress.
Correct answer
Joseph has created a self-organizing team that makes its own decisions daily, receiving additional support from Joseph when they need it
Joseph and the product owner organize and plan the work in product and sprint backlog sessions. As a self-organizing team, the group then distributes that work, being careful not to exceed the team's capacity.
Overall explanation
A self-organizing team makes its own decisions and plans and assigns its own work while relying on other resources for additional support as they are needed. Joseph should not be making assignments independently or with the product owner while best incorporating this agile principle. Processes and tools are not a critical focus of a team incorporating this agile principle, while team collaboration and self-organization are areas of focus. Joseph would not identify the tasks or make assignments. Agile teams are self-directed, so they will be identifying the sprint backlog and determining who will do what in each sprint.

Question 138
Incorrect
Hector is a vigilant project manager who is continuously looking for ways to help his project team. Specifically, he loves being a servant leader for the team so they can do their work in the most efficient way possible. Hector is also a big believer in the PDCA model of project assessment. In which part of the cycle is Hector most likely to discover an impediment?
Act
Your answer is incorrect
Plan
Do
Correct answer
Check
Overall explanation
Hector may find impediments in the planning process, but the most likely place is in the cycle's "Check" portion. Once he finds such an impediment, then he can act on it and hopefully help remove the blocker from the team's path. In the "Act" phase, Hector and the project team document the results, inform others about process changes and make recommendations for the future PDCA cycles. If the solution was successful, implement it. If not, tackle the next problem and repeat the PDCA cycle again. In the "Do" phase, the team develops and implements a solution, decides upon a measurement to gauge its effectiveness, tests, and measures the results. In the "Check" phase, the team confirms the results, measures effectiveness, and decides upon the next actions for the project work.

Question 139
Incorrect
Mary is the project manager for her organization and she is working with her project team to identify the project's business value. Several risks affecting the business value need to be addressed, and Mary wants to be certain that these risks are mitigated early in the project. Which of the following is true of the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 principle)?
Your answer is incorrect
80 percent of the project budget is allocated to 20 percent of the scope. 
20 percent of the project schedule is allocated to 80 percent of the scope.
Correct answer
80 percent of a project's problems are due to 20 percent of the root causes.
20percent of a project's problems are due to 80 percent of resources.
Overall explanation
The Pareto Principle states that 80 percent of a project's problems are due to 20 percent of the root causes. This is a key quality principle. The other choices in this example are false and are not indicative of the 80/20 principle.

Question 140
Correct
You are a project manager for your organization and have just finished a project on time and on budget. Pleased with your work, management has just assigned you to lead a virtual team that will create an organizational communication server. As part of this project, you will need to develop password-protected chat rooms for each branch worldwide and general chat rooms so every employee can sign on and communicate their ideas in real-time. What technology solution does this scenario best represent?
Your answer is correct
The choice of tools to communicate synchronously
The creation of one space to share and save all types of content
The choice of tools to communicate asynchronously
The selection of tools that allow you to create and track tasks
Overall explanation
The scenario describes creating tools that allow your organization to communicate synchronously. These kinds of tools ensure an efficient flow of information between team members. They provide a means of communication at a reasonable cost to hear and see team members in real-time. Additionally, they can ensure high engagement and efficiency in a similar way to a physical work environment. Tools to communicate asynchronously enable sharing information between team members even if they are far from their typical workstation. Creating a centralized space to share and save all types of content can be a shared drive or web portal and does not accomplish the project's vision. Project management information systems, such as Microsoft Project or Primavera, are ideal for creating and tracking tasks, not something this project aims to do. Note your exam will not test you on specific software but may mention the project management information system (PMIS).

Leslie is the scrum master for Project Y, which is 9 iterations into its deployment and has a velocity of 68 story points. Recently a new team member joined the team, and the new team member is located in a different country than the rest of the team. What should Leslie do next?
Complain to the product owner.
Your answer is correct
Determine what communication tools can be provided to integrate the new team member.
Remove that team member and find someone local.
Force that team member to move closer to the rest of the team.
Overall explanation
Leslie should investigate what technology can be acquired to integrate this team member. Removing the team member from the project is not ideal as this will alienate them and deprive Project Y of a resource. The team member has already been hired and added to the project. The locality of the team member should have been discussed before the person’s hiring. The product owner is unlikely to be of any assistance with this scenario.

A Gantt chart
Your answer is incorrect
A flowchart
Correct answer
A Pareto chart
A control chart
Overall explanation
A Pareto chart lists the problems and shows their frequency of occurrence. Control charts are a graphic display of the end results of a process sampling over time. Flowcharts show the relationship between components in a system. A Gantt chart shows activity time mapped to a calendar.

Question 143
Incorrect
As the project manager for the Carmel Corporation, Erika must create a cost estimate for her current project. Erika's manager has notified her that she must choose the most accurate estimating approach possible because this project requires a very precise cost estimate. In estimating, which response provides the least accuracy?
Definitive estimate
Your answer is incorrect
Budget estimate
WBS estimate
Correct answer
Rough order of magnitude
Overall explanation
Because it can vary from -25 percent to +75 percent, the rough order of magnitude is the least accurate estimating approach. A WBS estimate is not a valid answer because it is not a type of estimate. A definitive estimate is incorrect because it is more accurate than the rough order of magnitude. A budget estimate is more accurate than the rough order of magnitude and is therefore incorrect.

Question 144
Incorrect
Risk identification and analysis include careful consideration of project requirements, scope objectives, the nature of the project work, and the project documentation. Based on this information, which one of the following statements must be examined for risk?
Correct answer
A building inspector must approve the product before August 1.
Your answer is incorrect
The product must be constructed during the summer months due to the expected good weather.
The product requires oak beams.
The product requires a foil stamp of 0.32 millimeters.
Overall explanation
A building inspector must approve the product before August 1. This is an assumption, and all assumptions are treated as risks and must be tested and weighed. The remaining choices are considered project requirements, not assumptions, and therefore, do not need to be examined for risk.

Alex is a project manager for Relia Info, Llc. He was recently put in charge of the PWD team. The PWD team has a history of completing projects by utilizing positional power to move their assigned tasks to the top of resources to-do lists. Alex does not want to upset the team's flow and decides to let the team continue getting things done utilizing positional power. What type of leadership style is Alex utilizing?
Correct answer
Laissez-faire
Charismatic
Transactional
Your answer is incorrect
Interactional
Overall explanation
Alex utilizes the laissez-faire leadership style and allows the team to make their own decisions and establish their own goals. Not interfering with the group dynamics is taking a hands-off leadership approach. Transactional leadership focuses on organizational structure, formality, and policy. Charismatic leaders rely on their charm, charisma, and personality to influence others. Interactional leaders react based on the different situations they're managing.

You are the project manager for the Blinx Corporation, and you have finished a large complex project. Your manager, Kelly, approaches you to let you know that Stefan, a colleague, is leaving the organization, and you will be taking over Stefan's project. You meet with Stefan and learn that some of the stakeholders are not happy with the project and are not supportive of the projected expected benefit. Since you have just taken over the project, you request that Stefan introduce you to the stakeholders and set up meetings with the most critical stakeholders on the project.  Which of the following stakeholders will you make it the highest priority to get to know?
Your answer is incorrect
The project sponsor, who you have successfully worked with on many other projects.
The department employee unfamiliar with the project's product but interested to know more about the positive impacts the product will have on his working environment.
Correct answer
The department manager known to be resistant to change and who will use the project's product.
The stakeholder who is an expert on the project's product but is not interested in implementing it in his department.
Overall explanation
The most important stakeholders to focus on in any project are those who have high influence and are resistant to change. They need constant personal reassurance from the project manager, or they may exert their influence to derail the project. As a department manager, this person is a key stakeholder and wields a lot of influence over other stakeholders in their department. This is the stakeholder that the project manager should get to know as early as possible. The stakeholder who is an expert on the project's product but is not interested in implementing the solution could be a good second choice. Still, the department manager has much more influence over the project acceptance in this scenario. The project sponsor is an important stakeholder but is not the best choice presented. The department employee has high interest but a low influence on the project solution, so this is not the best choice presented.

Paul is managing a hybrid software development project that has changed significantly over the course of several agile sprints. When originally conceived, the project had numerous potential benefits identified in its charter and other founding documents. Paul is worried that while the team is releasing its increments quickly and functionally, it may not provide the initially promised benefits. Everyone is excited about the functionality of the software and the speed at which it is being built. Paul does not want to be the negative individual who says that the software is not meeting the original vision. How should Paul address the situation?
Correct answer
Review the charter and other founding documents with key stakeholders.
Your answer is incorrect
Change the project backlog to fix the issue.
Keep quiet because it is agile and is supposed to change.
Create a new charter.
Overall explanation
Paul may be managing a hybrid project, but in this case, the project has a charter. The project's key benefits should match the charter, even if many of the details have changed. Taking the charter and any other founding project documents to his sponsor and other key stakeholders is a chance to make sure that the vision is realized. In doing so, Paul can help prevent gold plating and ensure that key benefits can be instituted in upcoming releases if that is not being done already. Agile projects naturally create change, but that should not be done at the cost of the original vision and associated benefits. There is no need to create a new charter. Paul should not adjust the project backlog.

Scott is the project manager for Project VS, a project to take on a new type of material. Scott is leading the planning stage with the project team. Project VS's steering committee is concerned that the project will not have enough available resources and has Scott provide a breakdown of what is needed. What is the best source of information for Scott to determine resource requirements?
Speak to other project managers.
Ask the project team for a list of necessary resources.
Your answer is correct
Refer to the work breakdown structure.
Refer to historical project documentation.
Overall explanation
The work breakdown structure will provide Scott a list of all project tasks. From here, he can build a list of necessary resources. The project team is part of the project resources. Because this project is using a new type of material, the team likely will not be able to identify all of the needed resources without first creating the WBS. Historical documentation is not the best answer choice because this project is likely to have unique requirements. Speaking to other project managers is not the best answer, as this project may have unique requirements.

Russell has managed a project from beginning to end. As he is close to closing the project, he looks at the business case, project charter and other plan documents. He is amazed at how smoothly the project went and how the project team met every expectation laid out in the project documents. Those close to the project view it as a huge success. Yet company shareholders and many in the public view the project as a failure or letdown. What is the culprit with these disparate viewpoints on the project?
Russell is overestimating his performance.
Correct answer
A misunderstanding about what the project was.
The project did not deliver the expected quality.
Your answer is incorrect
Russell misread the plan documents.
Overall explanation
There may be a misunderstanding between the performing organization and the stakeholders on what the project was to accomplish. Assumptions and poor requirements can cause problems among the stakeholders. It is unlikely that Russell misread the plans as management considers the project a success. Russell overestimating his performance is not the best choice as management considers the project a success. Russell has met expectations internally according to the question. The project not delivering the expected quality is not the best choice. Quality is the totality of the entity to bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. Quality is defined as meeting the project scope, fulfilling requirements, and creating a deliverable that is fit for use.

Question 151
Incorrect
Busby International Holdings has just launched a new project for a new client and you are the project manager of this project. The successful delivery of the project's first milestone could mean an additional, lucrative contract for the organization. There is pressure on you and your team to deliver the first milestone as promised, with zero defects, and on budget. One of management's concerns is that your team is a virtual team and miscommunications among the team may lead to defects in the deliverable. What could you do as the project manager to help ease management concerns and facilitate enhanced communication?
Correct answer
Schedule times of collocation, when all team members can meet face-to-face during strategically essential times to perform better as a team.
Tell management that you know that your team is top-notch, and they should not be concerned.
Your answer is incorrect
Ensure that you will provide timely updates regarding the team's activity to upper management.
Have team members send updates directly to management about any changes or concerns.
Overall explanation
Collocation can be used to enhance the ability to perform as a team. While it will ease management concerns, it will also allow for improved communication and team-building relationships. Your team may be top-notch, but this likely will not ease management's concerns about the communication among the virtual team. You should be providing regular status reports as expected by management. However, the status reports from you will not likely settle management concerns about the communication among the project team. Having team members send updates to management is not effective. Management will not want status reports from each project team member, but only from the project manager. In addition, this approach will not settle management's concerns about communicating in the project.

Isaac is the scrum master for the Zoo Project, eight iterations into deployment, and $5,000 over a $123,000 budget. Recently Isaac was approached by a team member who asked why there was a task in the backlog to examine project risk. What is Isaac's most likely response?
The product owner requested it.
Risk should not be a task but a process.
A scrum master must represent their work in the project.
Your answer is correct
Risks should be constantly evaluated during a project's life.
Overall explanation
Risks need to be constantly evaluated, so tracking this work and reporting back on updates is important to project success. Periodic risk assessments are an important part of any project. A scrum master does not have to represent their work in the project this way. The product owner is unlikely to have requested this but would likely support the project requirement. The task is required, so removing it is not the best answer.

You and your team are working on a project that includes a stakeholder, Tera, who continuously tells you how to handle your project team. After several weeks of this, you decide that you need to find out more about Tera to see if there was a better way to work with her. You found out that she falls into the category of dominance/drive under the DISC method of personality typing. Knowing this, how might you now interact with her?
Tell her it is your team, and she has no authority over them.
Correct answer
Be prepared for when she shows up. Have everything laid out and the project objectives addressed in an organized manner.
Your answer is incorrect
Have management ban her from the project meetings and your side of the building.
Feed into her ego and make her think she is the one in control. Maybe then she will let your team work on their project tasks without her interruptions.
Overall explanation
DISC is a personality testing with four quadrants of Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness. Tera is a D type, a dominant individual. This personality type needs to succeed in all aspects of their lives. By presenting her with rational and organized information about the project, she can see that you are staying aware of any possible concerns and that the project is going as planned and on time. Telling her it is your team and that she has no authority over them is not a good choice considering her dominant personality. This can cause more disruption in the project and create conflict with the stakeholder. Feeding into her ego and making her think she is the one in control is an example of smoothing, but it may set you up to allow Tera to force decisions on the project, which you will be responsible for as the project manager. While you may want to have management ban her from the project meetings and your side of the building, this is not a practical solution to the issue.

Which one of the following would not be a good reward in this scenario?
Your answer is incorrect
Gift cards for dinner at local restaurants
Correct answer
Team member of the year designation
Bonus pay for the team members
Time off for the team members
Overall explanation
The team member of the year designation is a zero-sum reward, meaning only one person can win the award and everyone else loses. This type of reward does not acknowledge the hard work of everyone on the team. Bonus pay for the project team is always welcome. Time off for team members can be a welcome reward.

Having the team together makes it easier to manage them.
Your answer is correct
Having a team together makes it easier for them to work together.
Having a team together makes stand-ups easier.
Having the team together cuts down on distractions.

She has been arguing with the team members over how they have been verifying the information, citing that she has more awareness of the situation. What skill could be applied to assure Ariel that her concerns have been noted and confirmed?
Correct answer
Conflict management
Decision making
Your answer is incorrect
Emotional intelligence
Influencing
Overall explanation
The importance of addressing Ariel's concerns as a stakeholder and assurance that her concerns are being investigated can keep open communication lines and help build trust in the team/stakeholder relationship. Her knowledge of the situation may be greater than the team's awareness using the current channels. Discussing the concerns that need to be addressed and additional verification can ensure a continued mutual trust. Conflict management handles the situation for resolution, the betterment of the project, group productivity, and the working relationship's positivity. Decision making is not the best option as this scenario describes conflict management between the stakeholder, the project team, and the project manager. Emotional intelligence is needed, but the best choice is conflict management, as it is the most precise answer. Influencing is not the best choice as the project manager is not trying to sell the stakeholder but resolve a conflict between the team and the stakeholder.

You are the project manager for your organization. Your management team determines which project should be initiated based on the present value of the two separate projects. Project A will be worth $750,000 in three years, and project B will be worth $478,000 in two years. What is the present value of Project A if the interest rate is 6 percent?
Correct answer
$630,000
$710,000
Your answer is incorrect
$0
$45,000
Overall explanation
To determine present value, use the formula PV = FV ÷ (1 + i)n. In this case, the formula for Project A would be $750,000 ÷ (1.06)3, or $750,000 ÷ 1.191016 = $629,714. $45,000 is an incorrect calculation for the present value. $710,000 is an incorrect calculation for the present value. $0 is an incorrect calculation for the present value.

Anna May is a scrum master at the Michigan Plastics Corporation, which recently began using agile methodologies for some projects. Today Anna May overheard two stakeholders talking about dropping into the next sprint stand up to get updates on the project's status. The stakeholders specifically want to see a demo of what the team has created. What should Anna May do?
Your answer is correct
Connect with the two stakeholders and invite them to the next sprint review.
Ask someone on the development team to reach out with updates for those stakeholders.
Connect with the two stakeholders and direct them to the product owner.
Do nothing. The stakeholders will get the information they need at the next standup.
Overall explanation
Sprint reviews are an excellent way for stakeholders to remain informed on how a project is going. They will be able to see demos of the latest updates and interact with the project team. Doing nothing will not get the stakeholders the information they need. The product owner is not the best source of information for project status. Having the development team reach out will only reduce bandwidth and is not the best source of information.

ACE Corporation has several projects running concurrently. A few of them are part of a large project. If all the teams were to meet simultaneously, there would not be enough space at ACE Corporation headquarters. There would also not be enough time to hear the team members’ collective voices within the meeting. This situation could create unforeseen impediments that could block the team’s progress. Sam, the lead project manager, must find a way to hold a daily scrum meeting that effectively addresses these issues. What is his best course of action?
Correct answer
He could set up a daily meeting, known as the scrum of scrums, where each team member could be chosen as a representative to report on their team projects’ progress.
Your answer is incorrect
He could submit to management the need for larger conference rooms to allow for larger capacity for daily standups.
He could schedule an off-site weekly meeting that would allow all the teams to discuss the project’s overall progress.
He could have the teams email each other with updates, allowing documentation of progress to be reviewed as needed.
Overall explanation
The scrum of scrums is the most effective and least costly way for each team’s representatives to meet. This allows teams to coordinate with each other and remove impediments that could hinder projects while optimizing the team’s insight. It would be counterproductive to hold a weekly off-site meeting. The scrum of scrums is the best option. Emailing status reports among teams is not the best option presented. Bringing all of the teams together is not the best method to communicate status among the teams.

Millie's current project is a software development project expected to last 24 weeks. Recently Millie noticed that one of the stakeholders allotted time for senior developers to mentor others on the team. What is the most likely reason for this?
Your answer is incorrect
The stakeholder is a mentor.
Correct answer
To help ensure the team has appropriate skills.
To inflate the project's budget.
The stakeholder does not trust younger team members.
Overall explanation
Ensuring time is available for mentoring will allow the team to grow and become more effective. To inflate the project's budget is not a valid reason for mentoring others. The scenario does not tell you if the stakeholder is a mentor or not, so this is not the best answer. The stakeholder not trusting younger team members is not the best answer as there is no evidence of this in the question.

Question 167
Incorrect
You are the project manager for a local university. Joseph, one of your team members, approaches you before starting the project manager and informs you that he did not finish his assigned task on time due to a last-minute personal circumstance. What course of action should you take next?
Tell Joseph not to worry about it and reallocate the responsibility to another team member.
Excuse Joseph's behavior and ask him to provide an alternate date to complete his task.
Correct answer
Inform Joseph that he should update the team during the team meeting.
Your answer is incorrect
Reprimand Joseph on the spot and focus on the discussion when the task is completed.
Overall explanation
You should allow Joseph to address the group directly about the status of his assigned task. This action does not excuse or condemn Joseph's inaction. Instead, you will shift accountability back to Joseph and give him the chance to talk to the group. Telling Joseph not to worry about the uncompleted task removes accountability from Joseph but will not help him learn from this experience. In time-critical situations, allowing team members extensions may not always be possible. Reprimanding Joseph on the spot will only worsen the situation and discourage Joseph's motivation to continue his assigned task.

Question 168
Correct
Tyler is new to the agile methodology and is writing his first agile charter. He can most likely expect to focus on
Acceptance criteria for the known user stories.
Your answer is correct
A high-level overview of how the project will be done, sufficient to get approval on the project's major attributes.
All known requirements for the project.
The required scope elements that cannot change during the project.
Overall explanation
Agile chartering focuses on a high-level overview of how things will be done. Agile chartering will not include the other items, which are all incorrect. An agile charter should not include user story requirements and acceptance criteria. The team is expected to adapt to changes in scope based on business needs, so there is no special separation in an agile charter of what is required before work begins.

Question 169
Incorrect
Mills wants to ensure that every product he sells is precisely what the buyer expected but recognizes that gathering and implementing feedback is sometimes more art than science. In addition to offering a full refund for any defective or unsatisfactory product, he makes sure to keep a database of return buyers so that he can offer them better prices for subscriptions and buying in bulk. Which quality management practice does this entail?
Management responsibility
Mutually beneficial partnerships
Your answer is incorrect
Continual improvement
Correct answer
Customer satisfaction
Overall explanation
Customer satisfaction involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer needs. Continual improvement emerges from a cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting (PDCA) as a way of iteratively improving quality. Management responsibility refers to management's responsibility for providing the necessary resources for their teams to provide quality. Mutually beneficial partnerships are relationships in which one party creates value for another, a pattern that is repeated iteratively to form a positive feedback loop.

Question 170
Incorrect
Bruce is managing a project to construct a bridge spanning a large river. Two months into this project, the local government issues a new regulation that requires that bridge width be double in width from what Bruce was initially planning. Thankfully, the team has just been creating the blueprints and engineering of the bridge and has not yet started construction. Which of the following project aspects will be least affected by this new regulation?
Schedule
Cost
Correct answer
Quality
Your answer is incorrect
Scope
Overall explanation
It can be assumed that the same quality standards would apply throughout the project, regardless of the bridge's width. Because we are doubling the bridge's specs, more than likely, scope, cost, and schedule will all need to be changed.

Question 171
Correct
Grey is the project manager for project H, which is ten weeks into implementation, has a CPI of .98 and an SPI of 1.05. When Grey reports the status of the project is there is some concern from key stakeholders. What is the likely cause of concern?
Your answer is correct
The project is over budget.
The project is under budget.
The project is late.
The project is five percent late.
Overall explanation
The CPI, cost performance index, shows performance on project costs. A CPI of .98 means the project is two percent off the cost baseline. This is a minor variance, but depending on the organization and time of the report, it can signal trouble in the project. The project is not late; it is early as the SPI, schedule performance index, is greater than one. The project is not five percent late but is actually ahead of schedule. The project is two percent over budget, not under budget, so this choice is incorrect.

Sophia is the scrum master for Project X. A sprint review was just completed, and one particular stakeholder was upset that their item was not included in the previous sprint during the review. After a heated discussion, it was determined that the item would be added to the sprint after the next one. That stakeholder is now approaching Sophia to speak about that item again. What conflict strategy should Sophia use in this situation?
Your answer is incorrect
Forcing
Smoothing
Collaborating
Correct answer
Avoiding
Overall explanation
Since this topic is contentious and is already decided, Sophia should choose to avoid this topic for the time being. This will give everyone time to gain perspective and approach the challenge constructively. Given the recent history with this item, and since a solution was already agreed upon, smoothing may not help. Given the recent history with this item, and since a solution was already agreed upon, collaborating may not help. Forcing would only likely agitate the stakeholder.

This activity will allow him to determine if there are any issues with the deliverable. What is the status of the user stories?
Your answer is incorrect
Release testing, closure phase.
End of the sprint, going through to final release.
End of project, going through to the final handoff.
Correct answer

Overall explanation
Experts use the process of using the exploratory testing technique to test already delivered user stories and features. The other answers are incorrect. Stories that are done-done have been delivered to the user groups.

Question 174
Correct
William is the project manager of the NA Project. This project will replace all the laptops in the organization with a newer model laptop. Some of the stakeholders are concerned about the replaced hardware, the personalization of their existing hardware, and the software. William needs to capture all these concerns at the start of the project. What should he do next?
Your answer is correct
William should use the MoSCoW prioritization method for the stakeholder's needs and concerns.
William should document stakeholders' needs in the stakeholder engagement plan.
William should document the needs and concerns in the project scope management plan.
Nothing. The project charter should list the needs and acceptance criteria that stakeholders want for the project.
Overall explanation
MoSCoW prioritization method stands for four different categories of initiatives. Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, or Will not have at this time. The project charter likely will not, and has not in this scenario, listed all of the stakeholder needs and concerns but rather lists high-level requirements of the project. The stakeholder engagement plan documents a strategy for managing the engagement of project stakeholders. The stakeholder engagement plan establishes stakeholder engagement and defines how the project manager can increase and improve stakeholder engagement. This project management subsidiary plan controls how the scope will be defined, how the project scope statement will be created, how the WBS will be created, how scope validation will proceed, and how the project scope will be controlled throughout the project.

Question 175
Correct
Eddie is a project manager for his organization, which is a balanced matrix structure. Eddie was recently assigned a new project (ARK Project) and is utilizing a team working on the MOC Project in parallel. Neither project was dependent on each other, but both had due dates in the same week. Utilizing resource planning, Jim was able to schedule the resources for the ARK Project without crashing the timeline for the MOC Project. However, the team is now complaining that they are overworked and have lost their downtime due to the new ARK Project. What should Eddie do to resolve this issue?
Guarantee more time off at the end of the projects.
Tell everyone they are lucky to have a job.
Offer a bonus to the team working on both projects.
Your answer is correct
Search for more resources to add to the ARK Project or try to adjust the timeline.
Overall explanation
The correct action is to attempt to acquire more resources for the ARK Project or attempt to adjust the timeline. This will ensure that everyone is rested and performing their best. This action provides the best opportunity for the success of both projects. This is a common challenge in a matrix structure as resources can become overallocated. Offering a bonus is always nice, but it is not always realistic for the workers as there are only so many hours to complete the assigned work. Offering time off at the end of the projects does not resolve the resource overallocation issue. Telling people that they are lucky to have a job is not a professional or an emotionally intelligent answer and would likely demoralize the team.

Question 176
Correct
You have been appointed as the manager of a new, large, and complex project to construct a major new manufacturing plant. The project is different from any other project you have worked on before. The project cost is estimated at $20,000,000, and the project will utilize three vendors for different portions of the project work. Halfway through the project, a new risk has is discovered. Of the following choices, which should your team do first?
Schedule a risk-based spike to resolve or minimize the situation.
Add the risk to the top of the backlog so it can be addressed ASAP.
Your answer is correct
Ask a subject matter expert to assess the probability and impact.
Stop the project and evaluate the root cause of the risk.
Overall explanation
To assign a new risk to the right place in the backlog, we must first assess its impact and probability to calculate its expected monetary value. While the team members might be able to assess some risks themselves, some risks might need the specialized knowledge of subject matter experts.  We would not add the risk directly to the top of the backlog without first analyzing its probability and impact. In most cases, it would not be worthwhile to stop the project to evaluate the risk's root cause. Although we could schedule a risk-based spike, we would want to know the risk's priority compared to the other work items based on risk severity or expected monetary value.

The soft drinks are made from fruit sourced from a local orchard, which Doreen occasionally visits. On one visit, she notices that the orchard is selling its fruit directly to consumers, who are willing to wait in long lines. After conferring with the orchard's owner, Doreen redesigns her soft drinks to include the orchard's name on the label. Shortly after, Doreen's customers begin visiting the orchard from distant locations, and she begins selling her soft drinks there. Which quality management practice does this entail?

Customer satisfaction
Correct answer
Mutually beneficial partnerships
Continual improvement
Management responsibility
Overall explanation
Mutually beneficial partnerships are relationships in which one party creates value for another, a pattern that is repeated iteratively to form a positive feedback loop. Customer satisfaction involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer needs. Continual improvement emerges from a cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting (PDCA) as a way of iteratively improving quality.

Sarah is hosting her first meeting with new stakeholders. While her core team engages in a lively debate about a particular strategy's merits and comfortably critiques the project's deliverables, the new stakeholders seem interested but hesitant to join in. After the meeting, Sarah approaches the stakeholders to ask if they feel included. They admit that they are not sure how to best contribute to the team and do not want to come off as authoritarian. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by
Using open and effective communication
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Encouraging collaborative problem-solving
Your answer is correct
Creating team-building opportunities
Overall explanation
Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance. By helping team members integrate, mentors can indirectly strengthen their teams and empower their employees to identify other team-building opportunities. Mentors that constructively manage conflicts demonstrate their devotion to the team's integrity, but there is no conflict in this case. Collaborative problem-solving means the parties all work together to solve a problem, but there's no project problem to resolve in this scenario. Open and effective communication is paramount in good projects, but this is what is being demonstrated in the meeting and follow-up conversations with the stakeholders.

The matrix is kept in a publicly accessible repository where anyone can read it, but only Jakub can edit it. This is an example of which element of project governance?
Your answer is incorrect
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Correct answer
Defining roles and responsibilities
Stage-gate or phase reviews
Capturing lessons learned
Overall explanation
Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations. Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Capturing and emphasizing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices.

Chandler is a scrum master working with multiple other scrum masters to develop national accounting software to process tax documents. Julie is the key sponsor, and one of her requirements for the project is transparency and consistency in gathering scrum artifacts. Given the size of the project and the number of scrum teams involved, what is Chandler most likely to consider in meeting Julie's expectations?
Make artifacts a hard requirement from each employee.
Your answer is correct
Purchase a task management tool that comes with artifact features.
Suggest that agile has no focus on documentation, and capturing artifacts is a bad idea.
Recommend hiring multiple administrators to help teams organize artifacts.
Overall explanation
The ideal approach to managing scrum artifacts is through tools and software with built-in features, including scrum artifacts. Agile does capture artifacts, so this choice is incorrect. Hiring more people is not necessary when automated solutions can solve the problem. This is not a valid answer as artifacts are often team contributions, not individual contributions.

Penny is the scrum master for Project S, which is six iterations into deployment and on schedule. Recently Penny added a task to the backlog to double-check several deliverables against their quality checklists. The product owner pushes back and asks why Penny wants to take project time to do this. What is Penny's most likely response?
Your answer is correct
Quality checks are an essential part of any project.
Penny thinks the project may fail.
The project team needs to fill their schedules.
Agree with the product owner and remove the checks.
Overall explanation
Quality checks should be continually conducted during a project. This helps ensure the final product meets specifications. Filling up someone's schedule is not a good reason to increase a team member's workload. Thinking the project may fail is not a good answer. Agreeing with the product owner stops the project team from catching poor-quality deliverables.

Allan is a project manager for the Delko Corporation. This project will create a model home inside of a large warehouse. The model home will be used to show prospective buyers the layout, finishes, and possibilities that can be done without having to get permits and utilize land at the construction site. This model home will save the organizations thousands of dollars because they will not have to follow local regulations for electrical, plumbing, and permitting. In this project, Allan coaches the team on building a complete WBS to ensure all requirements are captured before the work beings. Milo, another project manager in the organization, asks Allan the point of taking time to develop the work breakdown structure since the model home is built internally rather than for an actual customer. How should Allan respond?
A budget cannot be determined without it.
Your answer is correct
It shows relationships between tasks and makes planning easier.
It allows for iteration planning.
Stakeholders like to see it during meetings.
Overall explanation
Developing a work breakdown structure gives the project team a way to see relationships between tasks and makes planning easier. Iterations are used in agile projects, and work breakdown structures are not a commonly used tool in these types of projects. Stakeholders wanting a work breakdown structure is not the best answer because the project manager should select the project tools, not the stakeholders. A budget can be determined without a work breakdown structure.

Assume that this is an occasional variation attributed to a common cause.
Your answer is correct
Investigate this discrepancy, as it is a wide variation from normal.
Reduce the velocity expected for the next sprint.
Overall explanation
Kimberly should investigate, as this is a variation of 50 percent. This is a sizable variation of 50 percent, so it cannot immediately be attributed to a common cause. The other areas are not what Kimberly should focus on, and Kimberly should not just leave this to the team to investigate, as she plays a primary role in reporting information.

Peter has worked as a technology innovator for over twelve years, and he has consistently delivered high-quality products for his customers. Peter has recently been invited to speak at a national conference to promote the concept of minimum viable products (MVPs) and delivering early and consistent feedback to his customers. Which of the following is not a benefit of planning for an MVP?
Your answer is correct
Disbanding the project team early
Risk reduction
Early value from the service
Early feedback
Overall explanation
An MVP is the smallest collection of features included in a product for customers to consider its function. Lean methodologies can be referred to as "bare bones" or "no-frills" functionality. The MVP represents the least amount of work that can be performed to achieve the business value the stakeholders expect. Early value is a goal of agile, as the most important features are delivered as early as possible, but that is not the best definition of the MVP. Risk reduction is admirable but is not the definition of the minimum viable product. Early feedback is admirable but is not the definition of the minimum viable product.

Milly's supervisor believes the project has successfully achieved its objectives and is ready to be handed over to the next project team. Which of the following factors for eliminating the need for a project would not be considered external?
Change in laws or regulations.
Your answer is correct
Shifts in the organizational structure.
Mergers or acquisitions that affect the organization.
Global or national economic changes.
Overall explanation
A shift in the organizational structure would be considered an internal factor. The remaining options are external factors that the project team will likely have no control over. Changes in laws or regulations, mergers or acquisitions, or global or national economic changes are external factors that may trigger projects to be terminated early.

Overall explanation
Durand should use this as an opportunity to mentor the stakeholder and build a relationship with them. Sending the stakeholder links may give them information, but it is not ideal as Durand will miss the opportunity to build a relationship. Inviting the stakeholder to daily standups is not ideal as the stakeholder has no background knowledge of the process.

Refer them to project documentation.
Assign another team member to help them out.
Your answer is correct
Answer their questions and refer them to project documentation.
Defer their questions until the next daily standup.
Overall explanation
Bob should take time to answer the developer’s questions and ensure they can access the project’s documentation. This will help onboard the new developer and give them the information they need. Assigning another team member is not ideal as it will not build a relationship with Bob. Only sending them to project documentation is not ideal as Bob will lose some relationship-building time.

As the project manager for Oleson's Swim Supply, one of Isiah's tasks is to evaluate the risks in his projects. Some risk events have a high impact, and some have a low probability. In Isiah's current project, multiple risks have impact scores that are high-risk but overall score in the low-risk category. How can this be?
Correct answer
Each risk has a low probability.
Until a risk occurs, the risk impact is not accounted for in the project.
The risk scores are graded on a bell curve.
Your answer is incorrect
The risks are rated high, medium, or low.
Overall explanation
The correct response is each risk has a low probability. A risk can have a very high impact on the project but at the same time score very low in probability. For example, the possibility of a hurricane destroying the project's construction site would certainly have a high impact if it actually happened, but the likelihood that it would happen is low. This is not a true statement and is therefore incorrect. A model using high, medium, and low compared to a numbering system would not change a project's overall high or low-risk score; this response is incorrect. This response is not relevant to the scenario and is therefore incorrect.

Before taking any action, Rebecca should understand the analysis. Once she knows what is going on, she can submit change requests to close the gaps. Acting immediately is not ideal as Rebecca may not fully understand the scenario, plus any changes will have to go through change management. The steering committee or project team are not likely to be able to assist in this scenario.

Overall explanation
Before acting, Isobel should meet with the other scrum master to understand the task and negotiate a path forward. Rejecting or accepting the request without first understanding its risks negatively impacts Project H. Isobel should not immediately allow the team member to help the other team. She should first examine the scenario and meet with the other scrum master to understand what is needed.

Question 18
Incorrect
You are trying to determine whether you should make or buy a piece of software. If you create the software, it will cost your organization $45,000 to create it and $3,400 each month to support it. A vendor, however, can create the software for $12,000 and will charge you $0.17 per transaction per month. According to your calculations, you will have 31,400 transactions each month. What should you do?
Hire the vendor if the software will be kept longer than 17 months.
Hire the vendor if the transactions will be less than 30,000 per month.
Correct answer
Hire the vendor if the software will be replaced within 17 months.
Your answer is incorrect
Make the software and reduce your monthly expenses by paying the vendor for the transactions.
Overall explanation
If you buy the vendor's software, it will "pay for itself" if it is used within 17 months. Calculate this by finding the difference between the build and buy, which is $33,000. Then, you find the difference in the monthly fees, which is $1,938. Divide the $33,000 by $1,938, and this tells you how long the vendor's solution will be valid. If the software is to be kept longer than 17 months, it would be more cost-effective to build the software than to buy it. After 17 months, the build-it-yourself solution is a better choice. The question already explains that the per-month transaction will be more than 30,000. This is not a valid choice (especially for the vendor).

Overall explanation
These stakeholders should be encouraged to submit new stories that move the project forward to the backlog. The product owner will likely direct them to submit their ideas to the backlog. Information radiators provide historical information on how the project is doing.

When examining the proposed change, you need to examine cost, schedule, quality, resources, communications, risks, and procurement. Your manager wants to know why all of these areas must be examined. Regarding the proposed change, what are you doing by examining each project area?
Your answer is incorrect
Scope change control
Configuration management
Effective project management
Correct answer
Integrated change control
Overall explanation
This is part of integrated change control. Configuration management does not fully answer the question. Scope change control is part of integrated change control. In this question, you are examining the impact of a change on all knowledge areas. This may qualify as effective project management procedures, but integrated change control more fully answers the question.

Kenneth has completed a project to build a new art studio for university students. The professors are satisfied with the artistic decorations and resources available for their students. Kenneth has collected the feedback from the university staff and students and is preparing to archive them. The project sponsor has requested Kenneth to schedule a close-out meeting to review all relevant documentation before signing off on project completion. Which document would be most relevant to prepare for the meeting?
Change request
Your answer is correct
Lessons learned report
Project management plan
Project charter
Overall explanation
The lessons learned report consists of the data captured during the lessons learned session and any additional input from participants who could not attend. A change request would typically be submitted during the execution or monitoring and controlling of the project phase. The project management plan would be developed during the planning phase. The project charter would be prepared during the initiating phase.

Question 22
Incorrect
Congratulations! You have finished the project work and are performing quality control. You are about to validate the scope, and management would first like to examine all the changes that have been requested and their statuses. Management wants to see which changes have been approved and which have been declined. Where can you find all of this information?
Your answer is incorrect
The risk register.
You will have records only of the change requests that have been approved because declined change requests are discarded.
You will have records only of the change requests that have been declined because all approved changes are incorporated into the project scope, and the time and cost baselines are updated.
Correct answer
The change log.
Overall explanation
The change log includes the process for submitting, tracking, reviewing, and approving proposed changes. You will keep declined and approved change requests in the change log. You will keep declined and approved change requests in the change log. The risk register is not relevant to change request tracking.

Georgia is the scrum master for Project Olivecakes, which is about to finalize its last deliverable, a new employee social network. Georgia has confirmed all her stakeholders are happy and has worked with the human resources team to ensure the deliverables will be readily available to employees. What should Georgia do next?
Ensure all project documents are properly cataloged.
Correct answer
Work with the human resources team to determine what cultural changes are needed.
Do nothing. Her project is done.
Your answer is incorrect
Work with the project team to finalize the last deliverables.
Overall explanation
Georgia should confer with the human resources team to evaluate the impact this project has on their corporation. This will help ensure the successful integration of the project. Doing nothing risks the project not correctly integrating with the corporation's culture. Documenting the project is important but not the best next step. Finalizing tasks is important but not the best next step.

Question 24
Correct
Mary has recently joined a team that has been using scrum in the project. Being new, Mary consults Tom, the scrum master, who explains the benefits of iterative delivery of value and timeboxing each ceremony. Which of the following best describes timeboxing?
Flexibility to expand time to complete as many activities as possible
Your answer is correct
Working with a fixed time schedule for planned activities
Allowing flexibility of scope after an agreed sprint goal
Working with a team in a boxed-shaped cubicle
Overall explanation
Timeboxing is allotting a fixed, maximum unit of time for an activity or event. The goal of timeboxing is to define and limit the amount of time dedicated to an activity. Scrum uses timeboxing for all the scrum events and as a tool for concretely defining open-ended or ambiguous tasks. Rather than allowing work to continue until the goal is reached and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished. Timeboxing is the predetermined amount of time for the different portions of a sprint. Timeboxing is a predetermined and set amount of time, not a flexible amount of time. The scope, which is the product backlog, is flexible, but this is not the point of timeboxing.

Process
Question 25
Correct
A scrum team is wrapping up the current sprint when Patrick, part of the development team, asks the scrum master when the increment is considered done. What would be the best answer the scrum master can give?
Your answer is correct
When every sprint backlog item to be delivered meets its Definition of Done, and the product owner accepts it
When the team holds the sprint review and demonstrates the increment to the stakeholders
When the allotted timebox for the sprint expires
When the team holds the sprint retrospective, the last event for the sprint
Overall explanation
The increment is complete when every item to be delivered by the team meets its Definition of Done, and the product owner accepts it. Every item in the sprint backlog has a Definition of Done that the team uses to determine when it is ready. The product owner can accept an item on behalf of the company only if it meets its Definition of Done—any item that is not done when the timebox expires must be pushed to the subsequent sprint. Any item that is not done when the timebox expires must be pushed to the subsequent sprint. A sprint review meeting is designed to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders to seek feedback. It is held after the work on the increment is finished for the current sprint. A sprint retrospective is an opportune time for the scrum team to inspect the team internally, creating a plan for improvements that will be enacted during the next sprint, but it does not meet the Definition of Done.

Question 26
Incorrect
Joyce is using a model that will help her gauge the effectiveness of different methods of communication on her project at Sandor Software. She has learned that the most effective methods are
Low in time and high in inclusion
Correct answer
High in information density and interactivity
High in information density and illustration
Your answer is incorrect
Low in information density and interactivity
Overall explanation
Good communication is highest in information density and interactivity. Information density is how much useful information can be conveyed in the communication and interactivity is how much the communication allows for a back-and-forth between the parties. Good communication would not have a low level of useful information or a low level of back-and-forth between parties. The amount of time or inclusion is irrelevant.

Samantha’s agile development team has just moved to Test-Driven Development. They are focusing on two new areas in their development model. They are most likely
Writing of automated test scripts for the future release of code and paired programming.
Manual peer testing and writing of automated test scripts.
Correct answer
Creation of unit tests prior to code being written and refactoring code once it is written.
Your answer is incorrect
Development and production smoke tests.
Overall explanation
Test-Driven Development is focused on unit tests written before code and refactoring for maintainability. Paired programming is irrelevant to TDD. Manual peer testing is a fictional term. Production smoke tests are irrelevant to TDD.

Rob's project will begin very soon. He reviews some of the documents in preparation, including a first draft of the project charter assembled from several brainstorming sessions. As he reviews the documents, he takes notes and paraphrases key concepts to be able to answer any last-minute questions from the project sponsor or stakeholders. Rob also creates a draft schedule including touchpoints for future project phases and a proposed process for incorporating feedback received to date. More importantly, these touchpoints will give Rob and his team a chance to evaluate the project against the project charter and the original scope documents so that they can make any required changes. Which process group is being integrated into the adaptive planning environment?

Planning process group
Executing process group
Your answer is correct
Initiating process group
Monitoring and controlling process group
Overall explanation
Initiating processes are performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project, including obtaining authorization to start or phase. Planning processes are required to establish the project's scope, refine objectives, and define the course of action needed to accomplish the project's objectives. Executing processes are performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project requirements. Monitoring and controlling processes include tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project.

Correct
Jose wants to use the most effective way to communicate with his agile team. This is most likely to be
Use of a video conferencing tool for the folks sitting on the other side of their building.
Via a daily report read at the end of each daily standup.
Your answer is correct
Face-to-face communication.
By ensuring all information discussed is written up in good minutes and distributed to all stakeholders.
Overall explanation
Face-to-face communication is always most effective in agile projects. Daily reports are not read during standups. Meeting minutes are not required. Videoconferencing is not the preference for those that can sit with the others on the team.

Martina is the project manager of a large software deployment project for French Logistics, a project which will replace all employees' computer operating systems. The majority of employees are in favor of this change, but there are some who are not. Part of Martina's plan, which she accomplished, was to complete a stakeholder analysis. Through the analysis, Martina and her team learned that some of the stakeholders were not aware of the change in the company's approved computer operating system. How should these stakeholders be classified?
Lacking
Target for positive
Your answer is correct
Unaware
Uninformed
Overall explanation
Stakeholders who do not know about a project are considered unaware is the correct answer here. Unaware stakeholders may be upset because they have been overlooked in the project planning. They may have requirements that must be added to the project, or because they were not included in the project planning, they may become resistant to the project's existence. The other responses are incorrect because they are not classifications of stakeholder classifications.

Incorrect
When choosing to buy or make a product, which of the following choices can a project manager use?
An Ishikawa diagram
Your answer is incorrect
An ROI analysis

A decision tree analysis
A fishbone model
Overall explanation
A decision tree analysis is a correct response because it can separate the pros and cons of buying versus building a product. An ROI analysis is incorrect because it does not answer the question as well as a decision tree analysis does. An Ishikawa diagram shows cause and effect and is incorrect. A fishbone model is incorrect because it shows cause and effect.

Question 32
Incorrect
At Massive Dynamic, they use agile project accounting. What is the most likely benefit of this approach regarding procurement?
Contracts must be evaluated each day as part of scrum sessions.
Procurement is consistent regardless of the approach.
Your answer is incorrect
The legal review must be completed within the timebox related to each sprint.
Correct answer
The process is often much faster due to smaller statements of work and less legal wrangling.
Overall explanation
It is likely that the SOW’s are shorter due to planning occurring along the way. They would be issued for smaller amounts of work or would have less defined scope information. Procurement is not consistent across all projects. Contracts are not discussed daily. Contracts should not be evaluated daily or within a certain timebox.

The project manager reports that the project is progressing according to scope. Management asks to change a few requirements with the scope. Which plan details how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed in the project?
The communication management plan
The change control system
Correct answer
The requirements management plan
Your answer is incorrect
The scope management plan
Overall explanation
The requirements management plan defines everything when it comes to identifying, documenting, and controlling project requirements. The scope management plan defines just the details of the project scope and how it is defined and controlled. The change control system is the process for all of change management. The communication management plan does not detail how changes to the scope will be documented.

Correct
You are the project manager for Industrial Lights Project. Your project team can have access to the job site only between 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Which project document would document this information for your project?
Project schedule
Your answer is correct
Project calendar
Project charter
Resource management plan
Overall explanation
The project calendar defines when the project work can be done, so this is the best answer. The project charter will not typically define when the project team may access the job site. The project schedule may define this information, but not necessarily. The project schedule typically defines the actual start and finish dates for tasks, not access times to the job site. The resource management plan provides information on the identification of resources, how to acquire the resources and specific roles and responsibilities of the resources.

As the agile team leader, Rose has described the high-level iteration goals and is letting the team decide how to complete the iteration. With this action, what is Rose proving to the team?
Rose is too busy working on her regular job.
Your answer is correct
As a self-organizing unit, Rose trusts her team and their expertise to complete the goal.
Rose is not a micro-manager.
That she herself does not know how to complete the iteration.
Overall explanation
As an agile leader, Rose’s role is to assist the people doing the work by blocking interruptions, providing support, removing roadblocks, and communicating effectively. That said, an agile team leader knows that the team members themselves are in the best position to organize their work and complete the goal. The other responses are incorrect because it is the job of the team leader to encourage the team to be self-organized; it is speculation to attribute any other reason to this decision.

Question 36
Correct
You are the project manager of the generator upgrade and replacement project, which is expected to last 36 months. The project work is extremely dangerous, so the project team will undergo intense safety training to ensure the workers' safety and make certain the project is not delayed due to faulty work. The cost of the safety training is known as which one of the following?
The cost of nonconformance to quality
The cost of doing business
The cost of regulations
Your answer is correct
The cost of conformance to quality
Overall explanation
This is an example of the cost of conformance to quality. The cost of nonconformance is the cost of having to redo the project work, loss of sales, downtime, and other expenses caused by not doing the training. The cost of doing business is usually assigned to regular expenses such as salaries, rent for office space, lights, etc. Training, especially this type of training, is above and beyond the cost of doing business. The question does not suggest that regulations require this training.

Question 37
Incorrect
You have been hired as an agile project manager by an organization that is new to agile. They have been utilizing waterfall methodologies to execute their projects and counting on your agile experience to bring incremental value to the business. You have been assigned a project. Your colleague provides you with historical data from similar projects on your first assignment and suggests that you calculate your team’s velocity and calculate your agile project’s end date. What would be your approach?
Correct answer
Advise your colleague that agile projects rely on detailed short-term planning and are focused on bringing incremental value over a long-term plan with one final product.
Your answer is incorrect
Use the bottom-up technique to estimate the duration of your project using historical data.
Thank your colleague and use the provided information as input to your planning processes.
Share the information with your team and ask for their input.
Overall explanation
Agile relies on an empirical process used for the estimation of velocity. Historical information, although useful, is not practical or ideal when calculating velocity or developing a schedule. It is up to the team to determine the size and complexity of features in determining the sprint duration. In addition, as the project is just starting, there is no reliable velocity to calculate. The team likely will not know what you are asking them or how your question will help them as they are new to the agile approach. This is a polite answer, but as the project is just launching, there is no velocity to calculate in order to predict project completion. Agile projects do not use the bottom-up approach to calculate velocity or project completion.

Justin is the prime project manager for his organization and hired the Launch-a-Rocket Company under contract to support the delivery of his cutting-edge weather stations into the atmosphere. As with many projects, which are outsourced, the quality of work and scope may become contentious among internal and external team members. Of the following choices, what is the first preferred method to deal with team disputes over critical issues, such as quality of work?
Correct answer
Negotiation
Your answer is incorrect
Alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
Immediate termination of contracts 
Appeals court
Overall explanation
Negotiation is the first preferred method of resolution when a buyer and seller enter a dispute over the execution of work under the terms of a contract. Organizations can usually work out issues before the matter escalates to lawsuits by negotiating and working with a collaborative spirit. ADR, the immediate termination of contracts, and appeals court are valid options to resolve contract disputes; however, they are not the best first options. Collaboration and negotiation are the ideal first approaches to resolving issues among stakeholders.

Heath is the scrum master for Project O, which is nine iterations into deployment, is on budget, and has a velocity of 93 story points. Heath is preparing for a meeting with a stakeholder who prefers to speak a lot, frequently to the detriment of other discussions. What should Heath do to prepare?
Your answer is correct
Review the agenda and have a plan for keeping the stakeholder on task.
Change the meeting time.
Ask a team member to interrupt the stakeholder frequently.
Remove that stakeholder from the meeting.
Overall explanation
Heath should determine what topics are likely to pull in the stakeholder and plan how they can be refocused on the meeting agenda. Removing the stakeholder is not a good idea as this will negatively impact their relationship. Interrupting someone is rude and not a good choice. Moving the meeting will not stop the stakeholder from overriding the discussion.

Shawn is a project manager for an information technology project, which is nearing completion. This project has replaced all of the older networking cables with a modern cabling infrastructure. The project has also established several WiFi hotspots throughout the organization's campus. The project steering committee has asked Shawn to verify which project objectives have been completed and which are still outstanding to plan the follow-up projects. What should Shawn do next?
Tell the steering committee to wait until the next meeting for an update.
Your answer is correct
Review the project work information and compare progress to determine which objectives are completed.
Refer the steering committee to the project management information system.
Ask the project team to report back on which objectives are completed.
Overall explanation
Shawn will need to review the project work information to know if any given objective is complete. Doing so will allow him to determine how the project is progressing. The project team is not the best source of information as they may not have a complete picture of the project. The project management information system likely contains too much information for the steering committee to digest and will not answer their question. Telling the steering committee to wait is not a good idea as they need information now to continue planning.

Product scope description
Your answer is incorrect
Acceptance criteria

Your answer is correct
The financial return expected of the whole project
Full details of the user stories

How coaches and managers are the same.
The notion that coaches are separate from managers.
Correct answer
How a coach is supposed to complete the job.
Your answer is incorrect
The concept that the project team is supposed to work for the coach.
Overall explanation
How a coach is supposed to complete the job is the correct answer here. When project managers, or any managers, are referred to by varying terms, job descriptions are essential so the project manager can complete the required obligations successfully. The other responses are incorrect. The role of the project team should be evident because the project manager knows how to complete the job; the project manager does not need to know the differences and similarities between management and the current role but does need to know what the specific responsibilities are.

Wait until the next retrospective.
Do nothing. The team will figure it out on their own.
Your answer is correct

Overall explanation
Oscar should ensure the developers use the appropriate definition of done and task requirements, which will help them determine how the task should be accomplished. Doing nothing risks the developers improperly completing the task. If Oscar waits until the next retrospective, he risks the scenario escalating.

You are a project manager for your organization. Your project has a BAC of $400,000 and is expected to last one year. The project work is scheduled to be completed in equal amounts each month. Currently, the project is in month three but is only 20 percent complete. You have spent $35,000 to complete the work. What is the earned value for this project?
–$20,000.
Your answer is incorrect
$100,000.
Correct answer
$80,000.
Not enough information has been supplied to determine this.
Overall explanation
The earned value for this project is $80,000. The formula is EV = % complete × BAC, so 0.20 × $400,000 = $80,000. The EV is not a negative number since it is 20 percent complete. $100,000 is the planned value amount, the amount the project should have spent to reach this point in the schedule. There is enough information to calculate the formula.

All of these services were conducted using the company's resources. Devin is working through the administrative closure portion of a project and wants to document some lessons learned in case another disaster occurs in the future. Which of the following considerations would not be relevant in this scenario?
Your answer is incorrect
Relevant scheduling problems or issues.
Strategic lessons learned that impacted the organization's project management methodology.
Issues that arose within the team or between the team and customers.
Correct answer
Sellers lessons learned.
Overall explanation
As the company used internal resources to deliver its emergency medical services, there would be no need to document the seller's lessons learned. Usually, when an organization requires a third party's support, it would document the seller's experience and performance and submitted it to the procurement department. Relevant scheduling problems or issues, issues that arose within the team or the team and customers, and strategic lessons learned would be relevant in this scenario.

Overall explanation
Personality conflicts may be a concern for the customer, but they are not as important or as likely to be of concern as project priorities, schedules, and costs. The customer hired your company to solve the technical issues. Project priorities are likely a top concern for the customer, so this choice is not correct.

Since the project will be grandfathered in and therefore unaffected by the law change, proceed as planned.
Correct answer
Create a documented change request.
Until the issue is resolved, all work must stop
Your answer is incorrect
Meet with the project's sponsor and stakeholders.
Overall explanation
When a new law or regulation generates a change request, a formal, documented change request is the best thing to do. A new law or regulation will override any existing project implementation. Before doing anything else, the project man must first document the change through a change request. A change request is not a reason to stop all project work.

However, a key stakeholder approached Luis with a new feature they would like to add to the project. What should Luis do?
Direct the stakeholder to the change control board because of the timing of the project completion.
Submit the feature for the team to review since they are almost done with the work.
Your answer is correct
Add the feature to the backlog as change is welcome at any time.
Decline the request as the change is coming too late for the project.
Overall explanation
Adding features to an agile project is as simple as adding them to the backlog. It is then up to the product owner to prioritize those tasks. There is no change control board in an agile project, so this request is not valid. The team does not get to review new features because features are added to the product backlog for prioritization by the product owner. Declining the request is not the best choice as changes and additions may enter the project at any time, but it is up to the product owner to approve and prioritize the change request.

Should the temperature exceed 79 percent, Candace, the engineer, has recommended a series of steps to be implemented. What does the 79 percent mark represent?
A workaround
An upper control limit
Mitigation
Your answer is correct
The threshold
Overall explanation
The 79 percent mark represents a threshold. Mitigation is a planned response in case a risk event occurs and is therefore incorrect. A workaround is incorrect because it is defined as an action in which to bypass the risk event. An upper control limit is defined as a boundary for a control chart's quality and is therefore incorrect.

It builds morale for all the stakeholders.
Your answer is incorrect
It enables the project to begin.
It enables all the stakeholders to meet.
Correct answer
It ensures that all the participants understand the project’s purpose.
Overall explanation
The project kick-off meeting informs participants of the project’s purpose. Although the project’s kick-off meeting may enable stakeholders to meet, this is not the primary purpose of the meeting. The project charter is technically what launches the project, not the kick-off meeting. Building morale is not the primary purpose of the project’s kick-off meeting.

The project sponsor will guide change requests on behalf of the project manager. The project sponsor will have an active, not passive, role in the integration management process. As part of management, a project sponsor will do more than give status reports to other members of management.

Isaac is the scrum master for Project H, five iterations into deployment, and recently completed a spike. After a contentious meeting with stakeholders, everyone committed to a course of action that Isaac does not personally agree with for the project. What should he do next?
Your answer is incorrect
Plan for the course of action Isaac supports.
Correct answer
Voice his disagreement, but commit to the course of action.
Attempt to influence the stakeholders to take other action.
Complain to his project management office.
Overall explanation
After voicing his concerns, Isaac should commit to the course everyone has agreed to, allowing him to share his concerns while also moving the project forward. Once everyone has committed to a course of action, attempting to influence them is not ideal. Isaacs project management office is unlikely to be of assistance. Taking a different method of action will negatively impact Isaac’s relationship with his stakeholders.

Question 58
Correct
Ann's team is having a conflict regarding their agile project. The team is focused on winning the argument. A few resources have chosen one side, and a few others have chosen another. Everyone is blaming the opposite team. What level of conflict is this?
The Norming level of conflict, where the team is getting to know each other and could be expected
The Crusade level of conflict, where the team is focused on protecting their group
The Disagreement level of conflict, where resources are focused on self-protection
Your answer is correct
The Contest level of conflict, where the team is focused on being right over the others
Overall explanation
This is related to the Contest level of conflict, which is focused on winning. This scenario is beyond the level of simple disagreement and not quite as intense as a Crusade, in which each group is focused on self-protection. Norming is not a stage of conflict.

Neil recently reached a milestone with his production team so that the factory they oversee can reliably generate the number of cars demanded. Neil celebrates with his team on the day they reach the milestone, but he is already identifying issues with the production process by the next day. For instance, certain parts of the process cannot be undone without effectively restarting. Neil begins brainstorming ideas for modularizing the production process so that production runs can be tweaked if errors are discovered. Which quality management practice does this entail?
Mutually beneficial partnerships
Your answer is correct
Continual improvement
Customer satisfaction
Management responsibility
Overall explanation
Continual improvement emerges from a cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting (PDCA) as a way of iteratively improving quality. Customer satisfaction involves understanding, evaluating, defining, and managing requirements to meet customer needs. Management responsibility refers to management's responsibility for providing the necessary resources for their teams to provide quality. Mutually beneficial partnerships are relationships in which one party creates value for another, a pattern that is repeated iteratively to form a positive feedback loop.

A project manager is completing a project to build a new condo. He needs to confirm that any field drawings by the architect match the office drawings that will go into the project archives. Which project management plan ensures that changes to the project scope and the product scope are thoroughly considered and documented?
Your answer is incorrect
The change control system
The integrated change control plan
The communication management system

The configuration management plan
Overall explanation
The configuration management system ensures that requested changes to the project scope, the product features, and the product scope are thoroughly considered and documented. The change control system does not fully answer the question. Configuration management system processes happen before integrated change control. The communication management system is not applicable to this scenario.

Katherine is a scrum master for project UP. Project UP is almost complete, but several critical enhancements were discovered during the last sprint that must be addressed. The project team has convinced Katherine these updates are necessary. Given project UP's velocity, Katherine believes this additional work will require three additional iterations to resolve. This will put project UP behind schedule. What should Katherine do next?
Your answer is correct
Meet with relevant stakeholders, explain the situation, and reset expectations.
Add a spike to the next iteration.
Update relevant information radiators so stakeholders can view the updates.
Do nothing. It is up to the project team to inform stakeholders of delays.
Overall explanation
Given the project's impact, Katherine will need to adjust expectations on when project UP will be ready. Doing nothing is not a good strategy as this impact increases the duration of project UP. Spikes are used to investigate and manage new technologies. Updating information radiators will not help reset stakeholder expectations.

This is an example of which part of the project scope statement?
Project exclusions
Acceptance criteria
Deliverables
Your answer is correct
Product scope description
Overall explanation
The product scope description explains the characteristics of a given service or product in accordance with the project charter and any requirements documentation. Deliverables are products, results, or capabilities required to complete a process, phase, or project. Acceptance criteria are conditions that must be fulfilled for deliverables to be accepted.

Ike is a scrum master at Watchdog Corporation, which runs multiple successful agile projects. Recently Ike met with another scrum master, David, in the organization. David seemed overwhelmed with the project and he is struggling to make decisions. The development team needs to choose an architecture quickly – but they are fearful of making the wrong decision as it will have a long-term effect on the project. What should Ike advise David to do next?
Your answer is correct
Analyze the project information to make the best decision with the team.
Assign an agile champion.
Replace the product owner with the project sponsor.
Speak to their team's managers to get insight into the problem.
Overall explanation
Ike should suggest the scrum master first determine what information they need to make their decision. This will help them gather useful information for their next steps. David may need to coach the team on the best decision – or help guide them to a decision to get the project moving again. Speaking to their manager is not the best option as the team and David already know what the problem is. It is the team's responsibility to decide and to start making progress on the project work. Replacing the product owner is not a good option and not something a scrum master can unilaterally do. An agile champion sits on the business side and helps evangelize agile.

This project will utilize agile, and its goal is to develop an app for mobile devices to host multiple phone numbers. Chris and his agile team are excited about getting to work, but the product owner has not yet set project requirements. After the initial meeting, a senior stakeholder approached Chris and asked him to start project work immediately. How should Chris respond?
Your answer is correct
Confer with the product owner on the backlog.
Refer the stakeholder to the steering committee.
Ask them to speak with the product owner.
Agree and start work with the development team.
Overall explanation
Chris should first confer with the product owner to determine how many product requirements have been identified and prioritized. The development team could get to work if the most important items have been prioritized in the product backlog. The entire product backlog does not need to be built and completely prioritized to start development. Chris cannot simply agree and start work with the development team as the product backlog must be adequately groomed for the team to select user stories. Referring the stakeholder to the steering committee is not the best choice for this scenario. Chris should speak with the product owner first, not necessarily stakeholders, even senior stakeholders.

Jason is managing an eight-month project and has held biweekly meetings with the project stakeholders. The project is 90 percent complete, is on schedule and under budget so far. With just one month remaining before the project completion, Jason asks the team to add two additional features that one of the stakeholders requested. The additions will utilize the remaining project budget to further boost customer satisfaction without risking schedule delays. Unfortunately, Jason must take an extended leave of absence due to a health emergency. In Jason's absence, Jenna has been asked to work as the project manager for the project, which will likely be complete before Jason returns. After learning about the recent feature additions, what is the best thing for Jenna to do?
Your answer is incorrect
Since this reflects poor planning, add a note to the lessons-learned register.
Acknowledge it as a value-added change.
Correct answer
Consider it as gold plating.
Ask the team to add the changes to the change log afterward.
Overall explanation
The scenario described is an example of gold plating. Gold plating refers to adding extra features that were not part of the project scope. It aims to consume the project budget by adding features that were not in the project scope. Gold plating may appear to be a good choice. However, it is bad for the project. Gold plating could increase the cost and risk as well as delay the schedule. It also increases the client's expectations. The next time a similar situation arises, the client will likely expect higher deliverables than what you originally agreed in the scope statement. If you do not deliver based on the client's higher expectations, the client will be left dissatisfied. A value-add change is a legitimate change that follows the project's change control system, which is not what has occurred in the mentioned scenario. Adding additional scope to consume the budget is not a poor planning issue. Asking the team to add it to the changelog as an after-work does not make it a legitimate change.

Your answer is correct
The project spends 1 dollar for 89 cents of work.
The project will likely finish under budget.
The project will likely finish in alignment with the cost baseline.

Phylis is a project manager on project GVX. During a recent prioritization meeting, two of her stakeholders got into an argument over which tasks should be prioritized. By the end of the meeting, neither stakeholder was satisfied, and the task list is still not finalized. What should Phylis do next?
Correct answer
Review what she knows about each stakeholder and meet with them together to negotiate a list.
Your answer is incorrect
Ask the project management office to prioritize the tasks for the stakeholders.
Since the stakeholders could not agree, Phylis should determine the order herself.
Do nothing. The stakeholders will determine a list eventually.
Overall explanation
Before she meets with these stakeholders, Phylis should determine the best approach to negotiating a resolution. This would involve reviewing any notes she has about those stakeholders and understanding the source of their conflict. Phylis needs to see the conflict from each perspective to help negotiate a solution. Determining an order herself runs the risk of agitating her stakeholders and improperly prioritizing items. The project management office is intended to support and guide project managers, not perform project work. Doing nothing runs the risk of the stakeholders escalating their conflict and not coming to a resolution.

Correct answer
Vroom's Expectancy Theory
Ouchi's Theory Z

Vroom's Expectancy Theory describes how people will work based on what they expect in return. If people are rewarded because of the work they complete, and they like the reward (payment), they will continue to work. McGregor's Theory of X and Y posits that X workers do not want to work and need constant supervision, while Z workers will work if the work is challenging, satisfying, and rewarding.

Question 72
Incorrect
You are the project manager of a large project that spans the United States. Your project team is non-collocated, so your communication and travel demands are high. You have made it known that no changes can enter the project unless the stakeholder wanting the change completes a change request through your web-based change request form. It has come to your attention that Scotty, a developer in Phoenix, has been allowing stakeholders to request changes to his work. What must you do in this scenario?
Inspect the changes that have entered the project and then have Scotty reverse any changes you do not approve of.
Correct answer
Implement corrective action so Scotty will not allow any more changes to the project work without using the change control system.
Meet with Scotty and his supervisor to discuss what discipline is most appropriate.
Your answer is incorrect
Meet with your project team members and key stakeholders in Phoenix and discuss in detail the change management processes you have established.
Overall explanation
You want to implement corrective actions to prevent the problem from happening again. You are not following the change control system or preventing the problem from happening again. You are Scotty's supervisor when it comes to project discipline. This answer may seem appropriate. However, not all of the project team members or the stakeholders are circumventing the change control system—just Scotty in this instance. As the project manager, you need to address the problem directly. In addition, the question states that all of the project team members and stakeholders are located throughout the United States, not just in Phoenix.

You and the project sponsor are working together to create a project scope statement. The project sponsor has concerns about the demand for safety for the electrical requirements for the project work. The safety concerns should be documented as which one of the following choices?
Cost of quality
Product requirement
Correct answer
Pure risk
Your answer is incorrect
Assumption
Overall explanation
The concerns surrounding the electrical work describe a risk. This is an example of a pure risk because this dangerous activity can only have negative outcomes if someone is injured. An investment, such as purchasing faster computer equipment, is a business risk because it can have a positive or negative outcome. The cost of quality describes the expense to ascertain the expected quality. A product requirement describes the requirements the project must adhere to. An assumption is something that you cannot prove to be true, but you believe to be true. Assumptions can become risks, but this is not the best answer in this scenario.

Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project’s life cycle. Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time.

During the last retrospective, the team agreed on a new process for taking work items from the in-queue column of the Kanban board and moving them into production. Today, Benji overheard a developer arguing with the product manager about the sprint backlog and how to determine which work item should be picked up next. What should Benji do?
Do nothing. The team recently reviewed how to move items from the Kanban queue into production.
Interrupt the argument and decide which task should be next.
Your answer is correct
Intervene and speak with both sides to determine the source of the conflict.
Privately reprimand the developer for not following the process decided during the retrospective.
Overall explanation
Confusion is common after a new process is implemented. Benji should work to understand why the developer and product manager disagree and then help clarify any confusion. Doing nothing will not resolve this disagreement and may damage the relationship. The scrum master should not decide which ticket is selected next. Privately punishing the developer without understanding the issue will undermine the scrum master authority and team morale.

Ivory tower
Resource pool availability
Your answer is incorrect
Conflict management
Correct answer
Resource constraint
Overall explanation
If certain activities require a worker with a highly specialized skill, these activities are resource-constrained. Although the availability of the resources must be examined, this scenario is an example of resource-constrained activities. The question does not provide enough information to determine whether conflict management was involved or was successful.

Fabian is a well-respected, outspoken project team member. His team members respect his technological experience, but if things are not done Fabian's way, there are problems. In the middle of a problem-solving team discussion, Eva, a project team member, throws up her hands and says, "Okay, Fabian, we'll do it your way!" Which of the following solutions is this an example of?
Your answer is incorrect
A leave-lose solution
Correct answer
A yield-lose solution
A lose-lose solution
A win-win solution
Overall explanation
The correct answer is a yield-lose solution. When team members begin to give in to Fabian's demands and insistence on always winning an argument, rather than finding the best solution, it is considered a yield-lose solution. A lose-lose solution is defined as a compromise in which both parties give up something. This is not a leave-lose solution because Eva only ended the conversation; she did not leave it. Both parties do not win in this example, so it is not a win-win solution.

Ethel is the scrum master for Project W, which is 9 iterations into deployment and has a velocity of 102 story points. During a recent sprint review, Ethel noticed that several stakeholders did not understand recent project developments. What is the most likely cause for this?
Your answer is correct
Ethel has not adequately engaged those stakeholders.
The stakeholders were busy with other projects.
The project team does not give engaging presentations.
The stakeholders are not involved in Project W.
Overall explanation
Stakeholders not understanding recent project developments are a sign that Ethel does not understand how to best engage with them. It is unlikely that unrelated stakeholders would be in the sprint review for Project W. While it is possible the project team does not give engaging presentations, this is not the most likely cause for the stakeholder’s confusion. It is unlikely that the stakeholders were too busy with other projects to anticipate the changes of Project W.

Risk assessment
Overall explanation
The checklist is the correct option as it allows the project manager to quality check his health and safety document before releasing it to the team.

Charles is assigned as a full-time scrum master on an agile team. The team is at the end of the second week of a three-week sprint when a team member becomes ill and cannot continue on the project. The team is committed to delivering forty-five story points in this sprint. What is the most appropriate action for Charles to take in this situation?
Extend the sprint timebox so the committed stories can be completed.
Jump in to start development to assist the team.
Your answer is correct
Ask the team to deliver what they can in the sprint.
Ask the remaining team to work longer hours to finish the committed stories.
Overall explanation
The most appropriate action to take in the mentioned situation is for the team to deliver what they can within the sprint and explain the variance. All incomplete product backlog items should be re-estimated and put back on the product backlog. The unfinished features can be addressed in the subsequent sprint based on (re)prioritization. Asking the team to work longer hours will make them counterproductive in the long term, and this action will not align with the agile principle of maintaining a sustainable pace. The scrum master could assist the development team with outstanding work, leaving a gap with his role. Scrum's roles, events, artifacts, and rules are immutable and although implementing only parts of scrum is possible, the result is not scrum. Extending the sprint timebox would lead to a loss of accountability and opportunity for improvement. If the sprint length is consistently modified, the scrum team loses the ability to write stories effectively, manage the backlog, estimate effort, and lose personal accountability. The timebox exists for accountability and to help each role learn and develop.

Overall explanation
The project kick-off meeting happens after the initial project plan has been approved.

When would procurements be considered closed?
When the buyer no longer needs the seller's services
When the agreed-upon contract terms have been breached
Your answer is incorrect
When all payments have been issued to the seller
Correct answer
When the contract terms of procurement have been satisfied by both the buyer and seller
Overall explanation
The procurement process is considered closed when the contract terms of procurement are satisfied by both the buyer and seller. This process occurs throughout the life of the project, not during project closure. Contracts are not kept open any longer than necessary to avoid erroneous or unintentional charges against the contract. Although the other options would be included in the procurement process, they are a part of the overall project process. Procurements will remain open until both the buyer and the seller agree the terms of the contract have been fully satisfied.

Eva must ask permission from the project leader to lead the task.
She can explain to stakeholders that she has done this task before and therefore it would be a good idea for her to take the lead.
Take charge of the task by subtly overpowering the leader.
Your answer is correct
Eva must explain and show her team that she knows she can lead it to success because this task is within her expertise.
Overall explanation
Whether a small task or a total iteration, if the team understands Eva can deliver a successful project, the reaction will likely be, “Yes, go for it!” Members of a self-organizing team should not have to push someone out of the way or ask permission to take the lead. Eva would address the project team for permission, not the stakeholders. Leading a project task is an example of fresh leadership from the project team, not some sort of political game.

Enrique is concerned about the scope of his project. Although he tried to be mindful of his project's resources when defining the project's deliverables, Enrique worries that he will be unable to deliver unless he is explicit with the stakeholders about what his team can and cannot reasonably be expected to produce. For instance, one of the stakeholders is especially interested in cosmetic features that are subjective and outside of Enrique's expertise. Rather than letting the stakeholder argue for inclusions like these in the project scope statement, as the project proceeds, Enrique puts together a list of what his team will do in the allotted time and clarifies that any additional work will require contract modifications. This is an example of which part of the project scope statement?
Your answer is correct
Scope exclusions

Product scope description
Acceptance criteria
Deliverables
Overall explanation
In the project scope statement, scope exclusions define what is specifically not included in the project scope. This helps to manage expectations and clarify boundaries. By stating that any additional work beyond the defined scope will require contract modifications, Enrique is explicitly excluding such work from the current scope of the project.

The product scope description explains the characteristics of a given service or product in accordance with the project charter and any requirements documentation.

A generalizing specialist is a person who knows how to perform their job duties well.
A generalizing specialist is someone who knows just one skill.
A generalizing specialist is someone who knows the responsibilities of each role.
Your answer is correct
A generalizing specialist is a person who is skilled in more than one discipline.
Overall explanation
A generalizing specialist is someone who is skilled in more than one discipline. A team of generalizing specialists is able to share the workload and avoid issues that many projects encounter. A generalizing specialist knows many skills related to the project, not just one. A person who understands each role and is able to perform their job duties well may be beneficial to the team, but those characteristics don’t make them generalizing specialists.

Question 93
Correct
Management wants to know how long the project work will take. The project manager uses a similar project to predict the duration of the current project work. The project manager is using which form of estimating?
Bottom-up
Expert judgment
Parametric
Your answer is correct
Analogous
Overall explanation
Using the analogous method, the project manager can use information from another similar project to predict the duration of the current project. Parametric estimating is based on parameters, such as units, metric tons, and so on; it has nothing to do with past projects. Bottom-up estimates start at zero and take in all costs for each activity; this also has nothing to do with past projects. Although expert judgment may be involved, this is not the best answer for the question.

Vera is the project manager for the Sharpie Project. She had 19 stakeholders and has added 3 project team members. Compared to before, how many more communication channels does Vera now have?
Your answer is incorrect
231
1
Correct answer
60
171
Overall explanation
Typical of the PMP exam, this is a difficult question. It is asking how many more channels of communication exist. Vera must calculate the new value of 231 and then subtract the original value of 171 for a total of 60 new channels. The correct answer is 60. The other responses are incorrect. One is not valid; 231 is the value reflecting the new number of communication channels; 171 is the original number of communication channels.

Question 95
Correct
Your project is just beginning, and you have invited all the key stakeholders, the project team, and members of management to participate in an initial meeting. What is this type of meeting called?
Your answer is correct
A kick-off meeting
A team development meeting
A risk identification meeting
A requirements gathering meeting
Overall explanation
A project kick-off meeting gets the project moving and identifies the individuals involved in the project. This is not the requirements gathering meeting, although project requirements may be discussed. The initial stakeholders meeting does not discuss risk identification. A team development meeting is a meeting where the project manager attempts to facilitate team development through activities and exercises designed to bring the team closer together.

Skylark Inc. is transitioning to an agile development approach. They have selected project M to develop a breakthrough water purifying device and have tasked your team with the development. The development team consists of cross-functional skilled resources. The team approaches you and states that they are unaware of what the final product will look like and are unsure how to proceed with the undefined scope. What would you advise them to do in this situation?
Perform a research spike.
Ask the customer for more detailed information about the device.
Your answer is incorrect
Follow the project charter.
Correct answer
Start with short iterations following the most promising approach and learn as they go.
Overall explanation
The best way to proceed in cases where there are many unknowns is to identify and follow the most promising approach and work in short iterations to learn and adapt as more information is discovered, which is a key agile benefit. Agile project charters are usually not very detailed or contain technical guidance for the team. Asking the customer more about the device on a breakthrough project will not be fruitful, as the customer hopes to learn as the development unfolds. Research spikes and gathering more information might be good options, but not in this situation, as the team does not know the product. Research spikes are most valuable when we need to investigate the how, not the what.

Your organization has tasked you with business development. Specifically, they would like to bid on government-based contracts. Where will you likely find information on government contracts that your organization could bid on for projects?
Sales channels
City hall
Historical information
Your answer is correct
Newspapers
Overall explanation
You will often find advertisements in the newspaper for pending government contracts. Historical information encompasses activities that have already been completed. Sales channels are too vague of an answer in this scenario. Not all government contracts are available through city hall; consider federal, military, and other agency contracts.

Question 98
Incorrect
Stephanie is developing the project management plan. She has put together a detailed list of situations where the project could result in early project closure and listed some of the major ones under the risk register. She is also aware that her teammates have conflicting personalities and have backgrounds that starkly contrast one another. Which of the following events would not result in a project termination?
Your answer is incorrect
The requirements changed during execution to the point where the project is no longer feasible.
The organization no longer needs the project deliverables.
Correct answer
Team members cannot work together.
Adequate funding is no longer available to complete the requirements.
Overall explanation
Team members not working together are not grounds for the project to close. The project manager should reduce conflict among team members, and if necessary, should be escalated to a higher level. Failure to acquire project funding, the project no longer generating business value, and the requirements changing where the project is no longer feasible are valid reasons for early project termination.

Question 99
Correct
Benjamin’s team at Stark’s Swords completes projects in an agile way, following appropriate practices. They use exploratory testing
Your answer is correct
To verify functionality in addition to functionally focused testing.
To explore the functionality within a user story.
For nothing, as it is not appropriate in an agile project.
Instead of functionally focused testing.
Overall explanation
Exploratory testing should be used in addition to functional testing. Exploratory testing is not for testing within the story but for testing the functional aspect of the completed story. Exploratory testing is not used instead of functional testing. Exploratory testing is appropriate in an agile project. Exploratory testing is not focused on functional details in user stories.

Question 100
Incorrect
Stakeholder identification is a process that should start as early as possible in the project and should continue through the project closure. This activity ensures that stakeholders are engaged and managed throughout the entire project life cycle. When does a stakeholder exert the most influence over a project?
Your answer is incorrect
During the project’s execution
Correct answer
At the project’s start
During the project’s planning phase
During the project’s closing phase
Overall explanation
Stakeholders have the most influence on a project’s success at the start of the project, and stakeholder influence is most significant during the project’s start. Stakeholder influence on a project’s success is most prominent at the start of the project. While stakeholders influence the project during planning, the earliest parts of the project are where stakeholders will have the most influence. During closing, stakeholders have little influence as the project work is complete.

Sarah's team is working to arrange the user stories to fit the proper number of story points into the first iteration of their project. They guess that the team can accomplish 40 points in the first sprint. The product owner mentions that their last project started off with 50 points, which should be the basis for this project. The product owner
Correct answer
Should not try to influence the planning of how the team accomplishes the project
Is right; points are arbitrary, and it is fine to choose 50 instead of 40 points for the first sprint
Knows that he should not be speaking up, as the scrum master is responsible for managing capacity discussions
Your answer is incorrect
None of the above
Overall explanation
The product owner should not try to influence how the team plans to accomplish their work, as the delivery team is responsible for figuring out how to accomplish it. The delivery team is responsible for choosing points, and they are not arbitrary; they are based on what the team feels the value of a point is. A scrum master is not responsible for managing any discussions. This answer is not valid for the scenario.

Jeremy is the project manager for Project Alps, which is in its third week of implementation, is $5,000.00 over a $100,000.00 budget, and is on schedule. A stakeholder has asked Jeremy to move a significant project milestone two weeks back in the project. What should Jeremy do next?
Agree and move the milestone.
Hire a consultant to advise the stakeholder.
Your answer is correct
Gather data about the milestone and the impact of moving it.
Reject the request since it is not in the project plan.
Overall explanation
Before acting, Jeremy should review the milestone and determine what impact moving it would have on the project. There may be a valid reason the stakeholder wants the milestone moved, but Jeremy needs to review its effect on the project. Agreeing to the proposal is not ideal as Jeremy does not know how those options will impact the project. Bringing in a consultant before ordering the impact will only incur additional costs and does not address the problem, if there is one, of the moved milestone. Rejecting the request is not the best option. Jeremy should first review the change and then act accordingly.

Question 104
Incorrect
Sarah, the CIO, wants to know why you have requested so many meetings with the users of the software your project is creating. While she acknowledges that the users are stakeholders, she does not understand why you believe these stakeholders should be involved so much during the project's initiation phase. Why should the stakeholders be involved now?
Your answer is incorrect
Involving the customers and other stakeholders reduces project risk.
Correct answer
Involving the customers and other stakeholders is part of stakeholder engagement.
Involving the customers and other stakeholders is necessary to obtain project sponsorship.
Involving the customers and other stakeholders improves project performance.
Overall explanation
Involving the stakeholders and customers will increase the probability of shared ownership, deliverable acceptance, and satisfaction. This is an ongoing component of stakeholder engagement, and it aids in maintaining interest and support of the project. There is no guarantee that involving customers will improve project performance. Although stakeholder participation does lead to risk reduction, it is not the best option. Stakeholder participation during initiation is not necessary for project sponsorship.

He tells you that you can send him an instant message (IM) about project developments. What type of communication is this?
Your answer is incorrect
Formal written
Informal verbal
Formal verbal
Correct answer
Informal written
Overall explanation
Instant Messaging (IM) is an example of informal written communication. Formal writing requires an update to something traditional, like a project management plan, not an IM. The communication request is not formal verbal communication because it does not occur in a planned setting and is not verbally communicated. The communication request is not informal verbal communication because it does not occur over the phone or in-person by happenstance and is not verbally communicated.

Question 107
Correct
The COO of your software development company has asked you to develop a rough prototype of a piece of software to test a proof of concept for her team. Which development approach is best suited for this project?
Predictive development
Waterfall development
Hybrid development
Your answer is correct
Incremental development
Overall explanation
This project’s best development approach would be an incremental development approach because the COO asked for a prototype to test a proof of concept. An incremental approach is best to deliver a usable portion of a product after a small development period. Predictive development, also called waterfall development, is not suitable for this project because predictive/waterfall development requires a great deal of planning and scoping upfront. Waterfall is a predictive approach and is not the best choice for this question. Hybrid development refers to a mix of incremental and predictive development; this is not necessary for a project to test a proof of concept.

Kiara is the project manager of the Roselyn Hotel project, similar to the Beatrice Hotel project she completed last year. To expedite the organization planning process, which of the following methods can Kiara use?
Correct answer
She can use the same roles and responsibilities definitions on the Roselyn project as she did on the Beatrice project.
Your answer is incorrect
She can use the same project plan for the Roselyn project as was used on the Beatrice project.
Kiara can use the same project team she used on the Beatrice project for the Roselyn project.
She can use the same project team reward structure for the Roselyn project as she did on the Beatrice project.
Overall explanation
To guide a current project, the project manager can use the same roles and responsibilities of the historical project when projects are similar. Using the same project ream reward structure is not the best choice here. The entire Beatrice Hotel project's plan is not needed. Even the Beatrice plan's roles and responsibilities matrix may not be an exact match for the current project. Using the same project team for the Roselyn project as Kiara did for the Beatrice project may not be feasible.

Question 109
Correct
Damian is an effective team leader who has built a safe environment for disagreement. Therefore, the team feels empowered to move forward without obstacles. Why?
The team can create a list of reasons why tasks are incomplete and present it to management.
The team has chosen to avoid conflict of any kind.
As a team leader, Damian takes responsibility for every decision that is made.
Your answer is correct
In order to make better decisions, Damian encourages the team to engage in constructive conflict.
Overall explanation
Better decisions are made when constructive conflict is encouraged. This allows team members to stand by their agreement. Creating a list of reasons why the tasks are not being completed does not subscribe to the safe environment or the agile approach to getting things done. Avoiding conflict means that a single person, not the team, will make a decision or guarantees the wrong decision will be made. The agile team leader’s role is to communicate, remove interruptions and roadblocks, and provide the team with what it needs, not to take responsibility for a good or bad decision.

Question 111
Correct
Eric is the project manager for his organization, and he has been working on drafting the project charter. Beth Ann, a project team member, asks why Eric needs to create the charter if everyone already knows this project will happen. What is the purpose of the project charter?
It enables the project manager to assign the project team to work.
It identifies the constraints and autonomy of the project manager.
It assigns authority to the project manager.
Your answer is correct
It authorizes the project.
Overall explanation
The project charter authorizes the project. Even in scenarios where the project is definitely going to happen, a project charter is needed to name the project manager, authorize the project manager to use the project resources, and communicate the backing and support of the project sponsor. The work authorization system enables the project manager to assign the project team to work. Although the project manager does receive authority over some project resources, the best choice is that the project is authorized to exist in the organization. This is not a correct statement about the project charter.

Your answer is incorrect
He got a book and read about the solution.
Correct answer
In the agile team’s common area, he overheard a conversation in which the solution was discussed.
Overall explanation
Osmotic communication is when a person overhears useful information while in a common area. Reading about the solution may provide good information, but it is not osmotic communication. Google is a research tool, not osmotic communication. Dreaming of solutions is not a way of finding answers and is not osmotic communication.

You are working with a vendor that is completing some of the project activities. Some of the vendor’s activities are on the critical path. Which one of the following statements about the critical path is true?
Correct answer
The critical path is the path with zero float.
The critical path is the path with critical activities.
Your answer is incorrect
The critical path is the path with the least lag.
The critical path is the path with the most activities.
Overall explanation
The critical path is the path with zero float. Note that the critical path can also be the path in a network diagram with the least float, but this answer is the best choice of all the choices presented. A path can have many activities and not be the critical path. Although lag can increase a project’s duration, a path with the least lag does not make it the critical path. This is not a valid answer; there are no “critical activities” in a project.

Bare fist fighting
Overall explanation
Participatory decision models, such as fist-of-five voting, are helpful to implement when a team struggles to make collaborative decisions. Bare fist fighting, of course, goes against PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. If Hector’s team were only in disagreement on estimates, then planning poker would be the correct method.

Drew is a project manager on a tight timeline to deliver a software product. After reviewing emails and work logs from the past month, he realizes that his team has several key product features ready to go but that the main components still require development. Drew thinks that putting the completed components into production would not be disruptive. And he believes that the project will begin to lose stakeholder approval if the remaining development continues to lag. How can the project manager deliver business value in this scenario?
Backlog grooming
Your answer is correct
Incremental deliverables
Testing at all levels
Acceptance test-driven development
Overall explanation
Incremental deliverables allow the development team to create and deliver increments of a product to the stakeholder. This agile approach ensures that the business value is realized as soon as possible, and the lower valued items are delivered later in the project. Testing at all levels forces teams to consider how some parts of a project or product interact with others to decrease errors and issues. Acceptance test-driven development brings teams of developers, analysts, and stakeholders together to determine thresholds for successful products and projects. Backlog grooming makes teams review, revisit, and edit their outstanding work and adjust priorities as needed.

Nick is the scrum master for Project W. The project is in its fifth iteration, has a velocity of 85 story points, and is on budget. Recently a stakeholder approached Nick to ask when Project W’s lessons learned will be documented. How is Nick most likely to respond?
Correct answer
Lessons learned are constantly documented and reviewed in retrospectives.
Agile projects do not collect lessons learned.
Your answer is incorrect
Lessons learned are documented in the closing phase.
Lessons learned are documented at daily standups.
Overall explanation
Lessons learned should be continually documented. Retrospectives are used to solicit ideas on how to improve and record those as well. The closing phase of a predictive project is used to finalize all documentation. Agile (and all other types) projects should continually collect lessons learned. Daily standups are intended to focus on what team members are doing that day.

Complain to the developer’s manager.
Send the team member to training.
Do nothing. The project team will take care of itself.
Your answer is correct
Pair the team member up with a more senior developer.
Overall explanation
George should use this as an opportunity to find a mentor for the younger developer, which will help build their skills and their relationship with more senior members. Doing nothing risks the developer not improving their skills. Sending the team member to training is one option, but not ideal as it robs a senior developer of a mentoring opportunity.

Robert is a project manager for a medium-sized organization. He has limited project management experience, and the project assigned to him has a tight schedule. Since Robert does not have much time to plan before the project's mandatory start date arrives, he wishes to move through planning as effectively as possible. Robert approaches his colleague Jenny for advice. Of the following choices, which one would be the best advice Jenny could offer Robert in this situation?
Make sure to document all the known risks before documenting the high-level assumptions.
Your answer is correct
Create an activity list before creating a network diagram.
Ensure there is a signed project charter and then start the WBS.
Finalize the quality management plan before determining quality metrics.
Overall explanation
Understand that the question asks which choice is the most effective way to move through project planning. The best option is to create an activity list because an activity list is created ahead of the network diagram. After obtaining a project charter, starting the WBS skips the essential steps of defining the project scope. In project initiating, high-level assumptions are defined, and this becomes part of the quality management plan and is not created after the plan. In project initiating, determining quality metrics are completed as part of finalizing the quality management plan, not after it.

You have been tasked with managing a project that must deliver value as quickly as possible. Your manager wants to show the organization how choosing the right project in balance with a reasonable project schedule can bring business value quickly for the organization. Your budget and scope are relatively flexible in this project, but you must provide some tangible value by the end of the year. Which development methodology are you least likely to use for this project?
Incremental development
Your answer is incorrect
Iterative development
Hybrid development
Correct answer
Predictive development
Overall explanation
Because the emphasis is placed on delivering value early, the option that is least likely to be used is predictive development. Predictive development focuses on early, meticulous planning and delivering value much later than iterative, incremental, and hybrid development approaches. It also requires a fixed scope. This is a good example of a project management exam question – pay attention to the actual question and its meaning. If you read too quickly, you may have chosen incremental or iterative.

Have the developer speak with the stakeholder.
Your answer is incorrect
Escalate the issue to her steering committee.
Correct answer

Complain to the project management office.
Overall explanation
Kelsie should meet with the stakeholder and influence them to release resources so Project Q can continue.

Question 125
Correct
Gregory has joined a cross-functional scrum team using a four-week sprint cycle. During the sprint retrospective for the current sprint, the development team raises the need for broader testing and business stakeholders’ involvement. These needs are necessary to perform testing so that the increment acceptance is smooth during the review meeting. Gregory suggests including the product's end-users full-time to work with the development team for the upcoming sprint and test the increment as it is built to confirm its acceptability. As an experienced scrum master, what would you recommend to Gregory and the development team to improve the quality of the tests?
Your answer is correct
Inform the team that all the necessary testing and quality checks should be part of the Definition of Done.
Increase the sprint length whenever there is a need to perform additional testing.
Use a separate testing sprint to perform all the required tests for the completed increment before starting the next sprint.
Add a dedicated team of QA testers who can focus only on testing the developed increment.
Overall explanation
The Definition of Done for the scrum team assesses when work is complete on the product increment. This includes acceptance criteria and non-functional features. The team must work to refine the Definition of Done for the upcoming sprints. Including testing in the Definition of Done increases transparency for the development team, which will verify how close the work is to complete and potentially releasable. A product owner must be in a position to accept an increment and to determine whether it is releasable. The project owner should represent all stakeholders’ interests and ensure that these interests are reflected in the understanding of the Definition of Done. Having a separate dedicated QA team would make the team less cross-functional and create waste. Large development teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be advantageous. A sprint is over once the timebox expires. Extending it to perform user acceptance testing or additional testing deviates from the guidelines of the framework. There is no testing sprint in scrum.

Question 128
Incorrect
Megan is working hard to be a better listener on her agile team. She hears the words spoken by her team and is highly attentive to them, personalizing them as she hears them. What is the best next step for Megan to improve her listening?
Megan should start repeating back everything said to ensure she has heard it correctly.
Megan does not have any changes to make.
Your answer is incorrect
Megan should start to coach the rest of the team on what she is hearing.
Correct answer
Megan should focus less on herself and empathize with the speakers on her team.
Overall explanation
If Megan wants to improve her active listening, she should move from focusing on personalization of words and begin empathizing with the speaker as she is listening, putting herself in their place to understand better what they are saying. Repeating everything is not the strongest choice, nor is starting to coach the team or stopping progress when she has not mastered active listening herself.

Clark is preparing the agenda for his project's close-out meeting. Clark's project team has provided him a list of talking points, including their communication with the customers, their understanding of the organization's strategic objectives, and some more efficient project management software recommendations. Clark has also spoken to customers regarding their satisfaction with the product and will discuss this during the meeting. Which of the following topics would not be discussed during the close-out meeting?
Training staff on the internal project management processes and improving these processes.
Correct answer
How quality audits should be conducted.
Obtaining the customer's formal project acceptance.
Your answer is incorrect
Level of collaboration for the project team.
Overall explanation
The discussion of quality audits should be conducted during the project's planning phase, not the closing phase. The other options are topics that should be discussed during the project’s closing phase. Obtaining the customer's formal project acceptance, performing training and improvements, and discussing the level of collaboration of the project team will be discussed during close-out meetings.

You are the project manager of the GGJ Project, and you are working with your project team to create the project’s risk management plan. Which one of the following items is not part of the risk management plan?
Risk strategy
Your answer is incorrect
Methodology
Risk categories
Correct answer
The risk register
Overall explanation
The risk register is not part of the risk management plan but rather the output of the risk identification process. The risk strategy, which defines your project’s risk management approach, is defined in the risk management plan. Risk categories provide a structure that ensures a comprehensive process to identify risks to a consistent level of detail and is, therefore, part of the risk management plan. A methodology defines the approach, tools, and data sources used to perform risk management and is thus part of the risk management plan.

Question 131
Correct
Hank is the scrum master for Project E, which is 5 iterations into its deployment and has a velocity of 64 story points. During a recent sprint review, two stakeholder groups got into a heated argument over which team would get the first set of deliverables from Project E. What should Hank do in this scenario?
Your answer is correct
Meet with both teams and determine the order in which they receive deliverables.
Have the project team vote.
Give the deliverables to the stakeholder with more power.
Give the deliverables to the stakeholder with more influence.
Overall explanation
Hank should meet with the stakeholders and collaborate to determine which one receives the deliverables first. The decision from this meeting should be formalized and documented. Giving the deliverables to the most influential stakeholder is not the best solution. Releasing the deliverables to the most powerful stakeholder is not the best resolution. Having the project team vote will not build a good relationship with those stakeholders.

Question 132
Incorrect
Given various risks and impact probability, which of the following determines multiple scenarios?
Correct answer
Monte Carlo simulations
Decision trees
Pareto charts
Your answer is incorrect
Gantt charts
Overall explanation
The correct response is Monte Carlo simulations, which can reveal numerous scenarios and examine risk and impact probability. Gantt charts, which compare the length of activities to a calendar in the form of a bar chart, are the incorrect answer in this scenario. A Pareto chart is incorrect because it helps identify a situation's leading problems. A decision tree assists in the decision-making process and is therefore incorrect.

Question 133
Incorrect
You are the project manager of a large construction project you are completing for another organization. You and the project team have finished the requirements-gathering process and are creating the work breakdown structure for the project. However, the customer informs you that they need to increase the size of the building by 10,000 square feet, and they are willing to accept the fee and time schedule change. What must happen next?
Nothing. The project manager can add the additional 10,000 square feet to the WBS.
Correct answer
The project scope must be revised.
The project must be started over.
Your answer is incorrect
The change must be managed through the cost control system.
Overall explanation
Revisions are a special type of project schedule change and cause the project start date and, more likely, the project end date to be changed. Revisions typically stem from project scope changes. The project has just started because the WBS has not even been created yet. Thus, it is not necessary to scrap the project and start over at this point. The project manager cannot simply add the additional requests into the WBS, and they must be added to the project scope, documented, planned for, and then migrated into the WBS. A cost control system may not be created at this point. In addition, the project is being completed for another entity, and they demanded the change.

Stephen is a new team member for your software upgrade project, and he has much experience working in predictive environments but is not familiar with many agile project management concepts. You decide to pull him aside to discuss some options for Stephen to understand the agile mindset better. Which of the following methods would not be the most appropriate method for Stephen to learn agile methodologies?
Collaborate with other team members to fill in the knowledge gap.
Research the topic to learn what they do not know.
Examine the projects or organization’s knowledge repository.
Your answer is correct
Continue to use his predictive methods to support the project.
Overall explanation
Stephen continuing to use his predictive methods will not help the team, especially for a software upgrade project primarily conducted with agile project management. Researching the topic to learn more is a good solution. However, this question is asking what would not be a viable solution. Collaboration is a good approach to ramp up on the project work and learn from others. While not always the easiest to do, learning from a knowledge repository can give insight into the processes and approaches the organization utilizes.

Gil is a new project manager at Vegas Trucking. Because the project team members do not know Gil and have not worked with him previously, they are not interested in working on the project goal. However, some issues have come up with the project. And, for the project to be successful, these issues need to be dealt with immediately. For most project management situations, which of the following choices would be the most effective problem-solving technique?
Your answer is incorrect
Forcing
Correct answer
Confronting
Compromising
Avoidance
Overall explanation
Directly meeting the problem, known as confronting, is the most effective problem-solving technique. Both sides have to give up something in a compromise. Forcing involves the project manager forcing decisions based on external inputs, such as seniority and experience. Avoidance does not solve the problem; it ignores the problem.

Question 136
Correct
Charles is part of the delivery team working together to figure out how to plan for the next iteration. The product owner is at the meeting and mutters to the scrum master that the team is not focused on what they should be. What is the most likely cause?
The delivery team is too focused on discussion of testing
Your answer is correct
The product owner may not have recently prioritized the backlog or has not provided the goal for the iteration
The scrum master is likely talking too much during the session
The delivery team did not calculate the value for each item in their estimation
Overall explanation
The lack of prioritization or the goal for the iteration is most likely the cause for the delivery team not being aligned with the product owner. The delivery team does not calculate the value. A discussion of testing has no relevance on its own. The scrum master has nothing to do with this situation which is focused on the delivery team.

Question 137
Correct
You and the project team are creating the change control approach for your project. Marcy, a project team member, wants to know why there is so much emphasis on creating and documenting the change control processes for the project. Which one of the following is the best answer to Marcy’s query?
A documented change control approach is required by the project customer.
Your answer is correct
A documented change control approach allows the project to improve because the impact of each change must be considered before it is approved.
A documented change control approach allows the project’s profitability to improve because each change may affect the profit and loss of the project.
A documented change control approach is required by management.
Overall explanation
A change control approach requires that each change request be evaluated and its impact on the project considered before approving the change request. Change control is required in many organizations; however, it is not the best answer for this question. The project customer may not know or realize that a change control system exists. In addition, this is not the best answer to Marcy’s question. This is not a valid answer for this question; not every project has a profit and loss statement (consider micro-projects and not-for-profit endeavors).

Francie is the project manager for a water sanitation project, the Trickling Project. She has concluded that there is too much risk in handling certain chemicals, so she is allowing someone else to complete this portion of the project. Francie will outsource the handling of chemicals and installation of filter equipment to a contractor with experience. This is an example of which of the following choices?
Avoidance
Your answer is correct
Transference
Acceptance
Mitigation
Overall explanation
This risk is considered transference because it has not been eliminated but given to another person or entity. The project manager has decided to allow another entity to deal with the risk; she did not accept it. Mitigation is incorrect because project risk has not been mitigated. Avoidance is incorrect because the risk is still in existence; a different entity is just handling it.

Hector is explaining to his project team the purpose of the stakeholder management plan. What does he tell his team?
The purpose of the stakeholder management plan is to identify all the opposed project stakeholders.
Correct answer
The purpose of the stakeholder management plan is to manage stakeholders' attitudes toward the project.
Your answer is incorrect
The purpose of the stakeholder management plan is to convert all stakeholders to positive, supportive stakeholders.
The purpose of the stakeholder management plan is to inform the stakeholders of the project's status.
Overall explanation
The purpose of the stakeholder management plan is to create a strategy to manage the stakeholders' attitudes toward the project. The other responses are incorrect because they do not define the stakeholder management plan's purpose. The process of stakeholder identification reveals positive and negative stakeholders by records kept in the stakeholder register. Although it may be nice, the stakeholder management plan's intent is not to convert all stakeholders to positive stakeholders. How the project manager and project team communicate with stakeholders is the definition of a communications management plan.

Sharon is working on Project Blueharmony that aims for software migration at a bank. The team takes the initiative and is focused on their work. In most cases, they do not need a manager, and they decide for themselves, performing task allocation, task estimation, story development, testing, and delivery in a sprint. Also, they estimate the time they need to do their work and define targets for the sprint or iteration. Sharon has taken up a user story that requires some additional features to be added to it. While coding the solution, she discovers that the original code is not up to the coding standards used in the organization. What is the best thing for her to do?
Update the sprint goal.
Update the sprint backlog.
Your answer is correct
Discuss the issue in the daily scrum.
Cancel the sprint.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to discuss the issue in the daily scrum. It may be a serious issue or not an issue at all, and until she can communicate with all the developers and the scrum master, there is no certain answer. Updating the sprint goals is not something Sharon can do on her own. Updating the sprint backlog is not the best choice presented. The sprint backlog shows the work that is reflective of the selected user stories from the product backlog. Sharon cannot cancel the increment; she does not have that authority. Only the product owner can cancel a sprint.

You and your project team have just created the proposed project plan, but your functional manager disagrees with you on many areas. Because you are operating in a functional environment, you would like the functional manager to compromise. Which of these individuals has the power in a functional organization?
Your answer is correct
The functional manager
The project manager
The program manager
The customer
Overall explanation
The functional manager has the power in a functional organization. The project manager has limited power in a functional organization and may even be known as a project coordinator or team leader. Although the customer sets the project requirements, they have little project management authority. A program manager is not likely to exist in a functional organization.

Incorrect
What term is assigned to projects that may cost $1 billion or more, may affect 1 million or more people, and may run for years?
Portfolio
Your answer is incorrect
Program

Megaproject
Macro project
Overall explanation
Megaprojects can cost $1 billion or more, can affect 1 million or more people, and can run for years. A program is incorrect. A program is not a large project but the management of projects in tandem to realize benefits that would not be realized if the projects were managed independently. A portfolio is incorrect. A portfolio describes the investment of projects within an organization. A macro project is not the best answer for this question.

Your project is running late, and you need to decide whether you should purchase a piece of software or have your project team build the software. Thus, you need to complete a make-or-buy analysis for a procurement decision. In which process is the make-or-buy analysis used?
Initiating
Correct answer
Procurement planning
Your answer is incorrect
Source selection
Contract closeout
Overall explanation
You are creating a make-or-buy analysis to determine the need to complete the work in-house or send the work to a vendor. You are completing procurement planning at this point in the project, which specifies how the remaining procurement activities will be managed. Procurement decisions are not made at contract closeout. Source selection will happen if the decision is made to buy the product or service. Solicitation, not initiating, will happen if the result of the analysis is to buy the project or service from a vendor.

You are the project manager of a large project to install 10,000 fixtures across a college campus. Your project team has been late on their assigned work, and you fear the project will be late. Which one of the following provides forecasting for the project?
Correct answer
The estimate at completion
The program evaluation and review technique
The graphical evaluation and review technique
Your answer is incorrect
Risk analysis
Overall explanation
The earned value management formula—estimate at completion (EAC)—provides forecasting for the project's success. The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) provides time estimates, not forecasting. The graphical evaluation and review technique (GERT) provides branching and loopbacks in network diagramming, not forecasting. Risk analysis does not provide forecasting at the level that EAC does.

Question 145
Correct
You are the project manager of the Home Automation Project. You are uncertain what the fee will be for wiring the home with bundled cable, so you hire a vendor to examine the home and create an estimate for the SOW you have prepared. You will use this estimate from the vendor to measure all other estimates from vendors that want to bid on the installation of the bundled cable. What is this estimate called?
Good faith estimate
Your answer is correct
Independent estimate
Budget estimate
Definitive estimate
Overall explanation
An independent estimate, sometimes called a should-cost estimate, is prepared in-house or by a third party. This estimate then measures all other estimates against it. A budget estimate defines the midstage estimate for the entire project. A definitive is the most detailed estimate based on the WBS for the entire project. A good faith estimate is not a valid term.

Peter is starting a large and long-term technology project that will last seven years. The project includes an operating system that is near the end of its life cycle. It also includes a requirement to process cards. The debit and credit card system includes cards with only a magnetic stripe, while some have a security chip. Eventually, the magnetic stripe-only cards will be phased out, but both must be supported for the time being. The operating system in question will be supported for another two to three years, with an unknown new operating system arriving next year. Those are the challenges that Peter is aware of, but there will be other technological changes, updates, and challenges during the next seven years. What mindset should Peter have in managing this project?
Your answer is incorrect
A waterfall mindset. One thing after another, in its order. He should plan for the next seven years.
An eye on the future because he knows change is coming.
A fixed mindset because Peter can only work with the technology he has.
Correct answer
An agile mindset because he should focus on the present with an eye to change.
Overall explanation
Peter should employ an agile mindset with an eye on current challenges and a willingness to adapt to the coming changes. Peter should not ignore the current technology with which he has to work and focus only on the future. A fixed mindset is unlikely to help Peter. Not only are there known technological changes, but there are also probably unknown ones as well. While elements of the waterfall are likely to help Peter organize the project, it would be unwise to create fixed plans years ahead.

Betsy is the project manager of the JGB Project for her organization. She would like to solicit seven vendors for a price to supply 1,000 fixtures for her project. What type of document would Betsy issue to the vendors in this scenario?
A request for information
A request for proposal
Your answer is incorrect
An invitation for a bidders' conference
Correct answer
A request for a quote
Overall explanation
A request for a quote seeks a price estimate for the procured goods or services. The question focuses on the price for the fixtures, so a quote is needed from the vendors. A request for proposal seeks ideas and suggestions on how to complete the work. A request for information is asking the vendor to provide information on their goods or services. A bidder's conference enables the bidders to meet to ask for clarification on the provided work statement.

Question 148

Paul is an agile practitioner on a newly created scrum team. During the backlog refinement meeting, a few of the team members said that one of the features in the backlog could have multiple technical approaches. When some team members believe doing it one way would be better, others lean toward the alternative. Although the feature is of high value, the team is concerned that if they do not take the correct approach, it will add risk to the project and result in serious performance problems downstream. What is the best thing for the team to do next?
Your answer is incorrect
Update the risk register with the anticipated risk information and inform the stakeholders.
Move the feature to the end of the backlog.
Correct answer
Move the feature to the start of the backlog.
Research and document the right approach first and then start work on the feature.
Overall explanation
It is recommended that high business value, high-risk features/items are worked on first. While that may seem counterintuitive, the sooner this work is done, the sooner the team will mitigate the issues and unknowns, leading to a higher quality product. That way, if there is a failure, it will occur early and relatively inexpensively. Risk management is the discipline of identifying, monitoring, and limiting risks. Several approaches to risk planning and management can be taken in an agile software development project. However, a prioritization process is often followed where the risks with the greatest loss and probability of occurring are handled first, and risks with lower loss and probability of occurrence are handled in descending order.

Josh is the junior developer for a project three iterations into its deployment and has a velocity of 94 story points. Halfway through the last sprint, the team completed all its tasks, so the senior developer, Shelley, told Josh to take an item from the top of the backlog. This confused Josh as this task was not assigned to this sprint. Why did Shelley ask Josh to take the next task from the backlog?
Your answer is incorrect
The team needs to look busy.
Correct answer
The stakeholder prioritized it.
Shelley asked the scrum master to authorize it.
The team forgot to assign it to that sprint.
Overall explanation
The sprint backlog is constantly organized by priority, so as bandwidth allows, the project team should grab the next item off the top and complete it. Needing to look busy is not a good reason to take on additional work. Even if the team forgot to add it to the sprint, it was still prioritized and can be added if bandwidth allows. The scrum master does not need to authorize pulling in a prioritized item.

You are a project manager for your organization and are working on assigning project team members to activities. You must complete an activity by a predetermined date. Currently, with four project team members assigned to the activity, the work will take 40 hours. You know that by adding eight project team members to the activity, the task will not necessarily be reduced to 20 hours. This is because of which one of the following?
Correct answer
The Law of diminishing returns
Parkinson’s Law
Your answer is incorrect
Theory Z
Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation
Overall explanation
The Law of diminishing returns affects the yield of work in relation to work duration. Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation deals with hygiene agents and motivating agents. Parkinson’s Law states that work will expand to fulfill the time allotted to it. Ouchi’s Theory Z deals with cooperative management.

Question 151
Incorrect
Your team is in the design phase of a new door lock prototype controlled by a mobile app. Stakeholders want the lock to be secure and reliable and want to balance the cost of the materials for the best profit margin for the product. The team engineers identify which type of material will provide the most significant security strength at the lowest cost through a series of tests. From the options below, which is the most likely technique used to determine these variables?
Correct answer
Design of experiments
Histogram
System flowchart
Your answer is incorrect
Design for X
Overall explanation
A design of experiments is useful for identifying significant factors that influence processes or the product during the prototype development phase. This approach allows the team to experiment with different combinations of materials in a ratio to costs and profitability for the organization. A system flowchart shows the flow of data through a system and is not the best choice for this scenario. Design for X optimizes a specific characteristic of a product rather than finding a solution through a series of testing and trials. A histogram is a bar chart that shows a graphical representation of data.

You are the project manager of a construction project for a new client. The client has asked that you include an outdoor deck as part of the project—something your company does not normally do, but you agree to take on this project component using a contractor to build the seating deck. For this portion of the project, you would like to use a time and materials contract. What must this contract type have?
The signature of the purchasing agent
Your answer is correct
A not-to-exceed clause
Addendums for each change in the project work
An end date for the procured work
Overall explanation
A time and materials (T&M) contract must have a not-to-exceed (NTE) clause; otherwise, the costs can spin out of control. Although a signature is needed on most contracts, a T&M demands an NTE clause—or else. Not all T&M contracts require an end date. Changes can spur new contracts, be covered by the existing T&M contract, or have addendums.

Zane is a project manager at Camera Corporation and is planning a new project. During a recent stakeholder meeting, the stakeholders told Zane that every task was of the highest priority. What should Zane do in this situation?
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Your answer is incorrect
Prioritize every task as high.
Agree, but assign different priorities on his own.
Correct answer
Work with the stakeholders to stack rank the tasks.
Overall explanation
While every task may be important, having all tasks ranked as the highest priority will result in the ranking losing its meaning. Zane should work with stakeholders to stack rank their objectives. Prioritizing every task as high is not the best answer because having all tasks ranked as the highest priority will result in the ranking losing all meaning. Agreeing, then changing the priorities, later risks negatively impacting his relationship with the stakeholders. The steering committee is not the best option as they are not responsible for ranking tasks.

Ray is planning for a major annual sporting event in the country. Although Ray has worked on similar events in the past, they have all been relatively minor in comparison. Ray has decided to reach out to other managers to learn about what worked for their events and what they could have done better. The managers provide Ray with a list of contacts and resources for this event and a general sequence of events, including an expected duration and cost estimation. What level of knowledge management best describes the scenario above?
Individual
Tacit
Project
Your answer is correct
Organization
Overall explanation
The sporting event likely consists of many dependent programs and projects and would likely be classified as a portfolio. The organizational level of knowledge is about managing programs or portfolios. The program manager or portfolio manager can seek information from peers who manage other programs or portfolios to adapt this knowledge to their specific needs. Individual knowledge is not a valid knowledge management level. Project knowledge is knowledge about implementing the tools and techniques to achieve the goals of the project. Tacit knowledge is knowledge with context that is difficult to codify as it resides in the minds of people.

In her review, she is confused regarding some of the ordering of the project work. Especially, she asks why there is a gap between the installation of the play structures foundations and building the structure. She thinks this must be a mistake or that you must be accounting for some risk in the schedule. If a task requires waiting until its predecessor is complete before it can be started, it is said that the task has
Free float
Your answer is correct
Lag
Lead
Project float
Overall explanation
A task that must wait for its predecessor to complete before it can be started has lag time. Lag time is waiting time, such as waiting for the concrete foundation to cure before your team can build the structure. You may experience lag when the material, such as concrete, paint, or even network redundancy, completes. No added labor can make the lag time be reduced. There is no lead here because lead implies that a task can begin without its predecessor completing it. We cannot say if there is evidence of float here without knowing the network diagram tasks' specific duration and understanding how they relate to one another.

You are part of the development team on a project in the second week of a three-week Sprint. The VP of the organization stops by and asks you to include an important, valuable feature he would like to see delivered in the current iteration. What is the best action to take?
Inform the scrum master, drop a feature of equal size from the sprint backlog, and add the new feature.
Your answer is correct
Inform the product owner to work with the VP to discuss the new feature’s value and priorities.
Reject the request. The sprint backlog must remain unchanged during the sprint.
Since it is coming from senior management, accept the request and add it to the sprint backlog.
Overall explanation
A product owner is a person primarily responsible for managing the product backlog and maximizing its value resulting from the development team’s work. The product owner must ensure that any new item adds value and can work with proper stakeholders and then add it to the product backlog for the upcoming sprints. The development team or the scrum master cannot accept or reject a feature directly without the product owner’s consent. Though the development team owns the sprint backlog, the members do not add or remove items arbitrarily. All related requests must be addressed to the product owner. The request can be added to the product backlog with the product owner. The sprint backlog need not be changed, though the product backlog can be. The product owner is responsible for the prioritization of the backlog.

Overall explanation
Constructing key performance indicators, or KPIs, allows stakeholders to measure the value provided by their project. Identifying needs is the process of helping stakeholders recognize the factors which are critical for their program's success. Formalizing objectives is the process of articulating the collective goals of a project's stakeholders. Mapping stakeholders helps to prioritize project inputs and clarify project goals.

Correct answer
Add a lessons-learned agenda item.
Your answer is incorrect
Avoid issues during meetings as they will go away with time.
Record the minutes of the meeting.
Discontinue updating meetings but schedule meetings with individual team members.
Overall explanation
A sure approach is to add a lessons-learned agenda item to the meeting and engage the team for feedback while welcoming positive and negative factors that impacted the team. Discontinuing updating meetings will prevent efficient sharing of information. Recording the minutes of the meeting may not capture any lessons learned. Issues and problems should never be ignored.

Performance reporting
Your answer is incorrect
Creation of lessons learned.
Correct answer
Performing cost-benefit analysis.
Formal acceptance
Overall explanation
The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a simple technique that is used to create non-critical financial decisions. It involves adding the benefits of a particular action (select a project) then comparing the associated costs. Cost-benefit analysis is done earlier in the project to help select between future alternative opportunities. All the other mentioned activities are done during project or phase closure. Therefore, performing a cost-benefit analysis is the correct answer. The creation of lessons learned is done during project or phase closure. Formal acceptance is done during project or phase closure. Performance reporting is done during project or phase closure.

What should Brooke do next?
Nothing; The stakeholder does not need to receive the monthly progress report because he is receiving the weekly status report.
Your answer is incorrect
Brooke should send the monthly progress report to all stakeholders and team members.
Correct answer
Brooke should update the communications management plan to include sending the monthly progress report.
Brooke should note this in the issue log and send the monthly progress report to this stakeholder.
Overall explanation
Brooke should update the communications plan. The communications plan must be updated anytime a change to a communication method or stakeholder is needed. Sending the monthly progress report to all stakeholders and team members may not be necessary; therefore, this is not the best option. Brooke ignoring the problem is never appropriate, and not providing the manager with this information may be detrimental to the project; therefore, doing nothing is inappropriate. Noting this in the issue log and then sending the monthly progress report to the manager is not the best option because this change must be reflected in the communications management plan.

Correct
Nicholas uses the multi-voting method on his team at Soap Street to have stakeholders prioritize the backlog. He has noticed that there have been several disagreements in the last few sessions. What is the best way for him to reduce disagreements in the next session?
Tell the stakeholders that no negative discussions can occur in the session.
Allow each stakeholder no more than a one-minute comment period per item.
Your answer is correct
Have stakeholders vote silently on their top priorities.
Ask selected stakeholders not to attend the next session.
Overall explanation
Silent voting is a feature that can be utilized in the multi-voting method to prevent public disagreements and power struggles. The remaining options are either inappropriate, like excluding stakeholders, or ineffective, like limiting the discussion to one minute or telling stakeholders not to discuss negatives.

Tracey is working on a project that has run into several major issues. The team is not communicating with each other, the monthly reports have been very general, and the team's overall morale is generally low. Tracey's supervisor has noted the team's inadequate progress and is scheduling a meeting to determine the root cause of the problem. This meeting is meant to review the project team's goals and achievements and its compliance with applicable methodologies and regulations. What term best describes the situation above?
Your answer is incorrect
Reviewing
Quality assurance
Debriefing
Correct answer
Auditing
Overall explanation
Tracey's supervisor is requesting an audit of the team's performance. Auditing examines a project's goals and achievements, including adequacy, accuracy, efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance with applicable methodologies and regulations. It tends to be a formal, one-sided process that can be highly demoralizing to team members. Reviewing is performed after an activity is complete without attempting to discover the root cause of a problem. Debriefing is performed after an activity is complete without attempting to discover the root cause of a problem. Quality assurance is using the project management processes efficiently and using metrics to identify flaws in the process.

Question 165
Correct
Joachim and Kelly work on a project together where Joachim is assigned as the project manager, and Kelly is assigned as a project coordinator to help support his efforts. The project is running well when suddenly an unanticipated risk surfaces, creating an issue estimated to cost $32,000. The analysis also shows schedule impact. Therefore, to bring the project back on track, Joachim immediately submits a change request to adjust the schedule baseline and uses the already approved contingency reserves to address the cost. The key stakeholders are informed. Kelly, however, is concerned that the scenario was not handled correctly by Joachim. What did Joachim do wrong?
He should not have submitted the change request since the risk was unknown.
Your answer is correct
He used contingency reserves instead of management reserves.
He did not account for all possible risks during project planning.
He should not have included the schedule baseline in the change request.
Overall explanation
In the mentioned scenario, the risk is unknown, and the project manager should have used management reserves instead of contingency reserves to address the risk. Contingency reserves are included in the cost baseline to address specific identified risks (known risks) whereas, management reserves are included in the project budget to address unknown risks. Using contingency reserves for unknown risks adversely affects the project's cost baseline. Therefore, of the choices provided, using contingency reserves instead of management reserves is what the project manager did wrong. The primary problem is where the funds originated from to address the unknown risk. Not all risks can be identified in project planning which is why there are unknown risk events in projects, so this choice is incorrect. The change request and baseline adjustment are not the best answer; the problem is the funding source for the risk response.

Amy has eight stakeholders on her project team and is using the 100-point method for backlog prioritization. There are 50 items in the backlog. What is the maximum number of points that any single item can receive?
5,000
100
Your answer is incorrect
16
Correct answer
800
Overall explanation
If all stakeholders agreed on one item as the one and only priority, the most points would be 800, which is 100 points per stakeholder x 8 stakeholders. The number of items in the backlog is irrelevant. The calculation of the maximum points is 100 points per stakeholder x 8 stakeholders = 800 points. The other answers are incorrect calculations for the maximum amount of points an item may receive.

Carolyn's agile mentor describes the team's current experience as an example of the gulf of evaluation. The team is three months along in their efforts. What has most likely happened within the team?
The product owner did not attend all daily standup meetings.
The stakeholders did not sign off on the project charter.
Your answer is incorrect
The development team did not work using paired programming.
Correct answer
The stakeholders were not as engaged as they should have been.
Overall explanation
The stakeholders were not as engaged as they should have been because a lack of stakeholder engagement often causes the gulf of evaluation. The product owner's attendance at how the software is delivered would not cause the wrong thing to be delivered. Paired programming should not affect the team delivery of what the customer (product owner) desires. A sign-off on a charter is irrelevant to this issue.

Christopher is a part of the delivery team that is working on the first iteration of their project. One of his assigned user stories is missing acceptance criteria. Christopher should most likely
Ask the scrum master to add the acceptance criteria so he can continue work.
Your answer is incorrect
Reestimate the item before he continues his work.
Correct answer
Stop work on the item, as the team made a mistake in estimating a user story with no defined acceptance criteria.
Ask the product owner to add the acceptance criteria so he can continue work.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to stop working on the item, as it should not have been estimated without clear criteria. A scrum master is not responsible for acceptance criteria. The product owner could add acceptance criteria, but the item should not have been estimated without it. The item should be reestimated, but work should not necessarily continue, especially if the estimate is different.

The project team
The human resources department
The project sponsor
Overall explanation
All project team members share the responsibility to enforce the rules. This does not answer the question fully. The project manager may lead the enforcement, but the question asks who has the responsibility—and the correct answer is the entire project team. It may, in some instances, be up to the project manager to escalate the issue through the project sponsor to human resources.

Phil is a scrum master at Project Corporation. After a recent planning session, Phil overheard two stakeholders complaining that they do not understand what a story point is. What should Phil do?
Do nothing. Stakeholders do not need to worry about story points.
Your answer is incorrect
Assign a team member to train the stakeholders.
Do nothing. The product owner will fill them in.
Correct answer
Briefly remind them and then follow up with additional material.
Overall explanation
Phil should give them a brief overview and then send over several examples. This will help the stakeholders understand how story points are used. Doing nothing risks alienating the stakeholders and causing more confusion on the project. It is always best to communicate to clarify confusion or misunderstandings. Assigning a team member will reduce the team’s capacity and may not fully address the stakeholder’s questions.

After a recent retrospective, a developer approached Quincy with several insightful ideas on the project. The developer also let Quincy know they are too shy to share these in the retrospective. What should Quincy do next?
Record those ideas in the project documentation.
Your answer is correct
Encourage the developer to share those ideas during the retrospective, but offer to share the updates on their behalf if they prefer.
Reject those ideas since they were shared after the retrospective.
Refer the developer to the product owner.
Overall explanation
Quincy should encourage this developer to speak up during the retrospective and share their ideas and be sensitive to their discomfort in doing so themselves. Recording the ideas is a good next step, but not the best one in this scenario. Rejecting those ideas is not a good idea as they are valuable to Project D. The product owner is not likely able to assist in this scenario.

Dinah is the project manager for a project that has been in motion for a few months and is ready to move into the first phase of project execution. During the project's planning phase, Dinah is alerted by her sponsor that she has apparently overlooked some stakeholders. What should Dinah do next?
Start execution of the project but schedule a meeting with stakeholders
Your answer is incorrect
Meet with the stakeholders to give a project update
Figure out if the oversight has damaged the project's objectives
Correct answer
Immediately contact, apologize to, and analyze the stakeholders
Overall explanation
Although it is of the utmost importance to identify all project stakeholders as early in the project's life as possible, it is not unheard of for stakeholders to be overlooked by the project manager. When stakeholders are overlooked, the project manager should immediately deal with the problem, and a search for a solution begins. In the above example, Dinah must immediately contact the stakeholders and apologize for the oversight. It would be most helpful for her then to analyze the stakeholders' attitudes toward the project. Scheduling a meeting to update stakeholders does not apologize or show remorse for the project managers' mistake. Figuring out whether the oversight has damaged the project's objectives does not include stakeholder analysis. Stakeholders must be informed and communicated with regarding the project and how it may affect them. Without stakeholder input, executing project work may not be useful.

Terry's team is disagreeing about an issue. They want to feel safe and protected, with some team members engaging and some distancing themselves from the debate. A few discussions are happening online. How should Terry facilitate this issue?
Your answer is incorrect
Terry should immediately step in and schedule a group meeting so that the entire team can hear the opposing sides.
Terry should mediate by going back and forth between the two sides and negotiating an agreement
Terry should do nothing.
Correct answer
At this early stage of the conflict, Terry should empower the team members to solve this themselves.
Overall explanation
At this disagreement level of conflict, the best choice is for Terry to empower the team to resolve this. In an agile team, conflict should be addressed and resolved collaboratively. A meeting would not be scheduled only to hear another side but to be focused on a resolution. There should be going back and forth without the team getting together. This situation should not be ignored.

Question 176
Incorrect
A project manager has a project team member whose work is consistently not in alignment with the quality metrics as required by the customer. This discrepancy results in rework and wasted time. What should the project manager do? (Choose the best answer.)
Correct answer
Implement corrective actions.
Your answer is incorrect
Adjust the quality baseline.
Update the quality management plan.
Discipline the project team member.
Overall explanation
Corrective actions should be taken to bring future performance into alignment with the project plan. Adjusting the quality baseline will not change what is expected from the customer and will not correct the problem. Although corrective actions may include disciplining the project team member and using other mechanisms to prevent the problem from recurring, this is not the best answer. Updating quality management plans will not solve the problem of unacceptable work.

Question 178

The way that Christine’s team completes frequent releases of their product without introducing many new bugs is most likely
Using a few manual testers focused on just core functionality for each release.
Your answer is incorrect
Due to paired programming
With a full regression test done by the delivery team
Correct answer
Using continuous integration, which includes automated testing as part of the software building process, to ensure basic functionality still works properly.
Overall explanation
Continuous integration is embedded into releases to ensure that bugs are not being introduced. Regression testing can take a long time and is not a good option for frequent releases. Paired programming is not focused on bugs as much as continuous integration. Manual testers do not need to be involved, as it would be a burden on testing resources if releases are frequently happening, which could be multiple times per day.

Overall explanation
For negotiations to be fair and balanced, an environment of mutual respect and cooperation is best. Mutual respect and admiration are not a necessity for the people involved in negotiations.

Of the following, which represents the vast majority of a projects' budget?
Cost of goods and services
Your answer is incorrect
Project planning
Correct answer
Project plan execution
Labor
Overall explanation
Project plan execution, which represents the vast majority of the project budget, is the correct response. The cost of goods and services is incorrect because the procurement of such falls within the project plan execution. Further, not every project needs to procure goods and services. Labor is incorrect because it does not reflect the biggest expense in a project. Although it may contain the most processes, project planning is incorrect because it does not reflect the majority of the project budget.

At your local PMI chapter meeting, a speaker suggests that scrum teams create an impediment backlog. Which statement would not be included in an impediment backlog?
The project's customer-submitted feedback requiring a small code change.
There is a technical dependency that has been discovered between two codebases.
Correct answer
The project budget needs to be increased.
A new developer's keyboard is broken, and they require a new one.
Overall explanation
The project's budget would not come up in an impediment backlog. If the budget needs to increase, this could be a blocker rather than an impediment if the project at large is on the line. The impediment backlog would contain impediments that are holding up activities or tasks, not the entire project. A small code change is an example of an impediment. A technical dependency is an example of an impediment. A new keyboard is an example of an impediment.

Upon digging deeper, you notice that a few team members are unsure what work they need to accomplish on the project. Which of the following documents would you ask the team members to refer to in this situation?
Project scope statement
Correct answer
WBS dictionary
Activity list
Scope management plan
Overall explanation
The WBS dictionary defines each element in the WBS and contains detailed descriptions of the work packages. Therefore, the team members should refer to it to understand what work they need to accomplish. While activity lists may identify the work package they relate to, they will not encompass detailed descriptions of the work packages. The scope management plan describes how the scope will be planned, managed, and controlled. However, it will not include an explanation of each work package.

The risk-reward ratio
Risk acceptance
Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
Correct answer
The utility function
Overall explanation
The correct answer is the utility function, which describes a person's willingness to tolerate risk. The risk-reward ratio is incorrect because it describes the potential reward for taking a risk in the project. Risk acceptance is defined as allowancing risks to exist because the risks have been determined as low in impact, low in probability, or both.

Arthur is a detailed project manager who favors a waterfall approach to his projects. He is detailed in terms of tasks, resources, budget, and the like. Like most project managers, Arthur does not employ every single tool or resource at a project manager's disposal. For example, he uses a work breakdown structure but tends to skip certain documents that other project managers include in their project process. Despite Arthur's sense of detail, he has trouble with multiple team members taking ownership of the same tasks, while some tasks are falling through the cracks without an owner. What kind of tool can Arthur employ to improve on this?
Lessons learned register
Correct answer
RACI matrix
Project communication plan

Overall explanation
A RACI matrix will help Arthur because this tool shows who is responsible, accountable, consulted, or informed on each task and will help remove confusion and duplication of efforts. Scrum is an agile discipline, and Arthur is not seeking to change to an agile way of doing things. A project communication plan is a good thing but will not solve the mix-ups in assignments.

Because Tim is a highly skilled team member, when errors come up on the project, he tends to blame everyone but himself. How can you show Tim that the project's errors are not just because of others' mistakes but also because of a lack of communication on his part?
Call a team meeting with the entire team and discuss the importance of team accountability to ensure project success.
Discuss with other team members how they feel about the team and how Tim does not take accountability for the project's errors.
Correct answer
Discuss with Tim that he is a valuable asset to the team; however, he also needs to take accountability for mistakes that happen on the project.
Provide rewards to Tim to let him know how much he is appreciated and how he has helped the team - but also communicate to him to help him see that he could do better.
Overall explanation
It would be best if you discussed with Tim that he is an asset to the team, but he also needs to take accountability for mistakes that happen on the team. Rewarding Tim is not the best approach to resolve the problem. This situation and Tim's work should not be discussed with the other team members without Tim present. This is not transparent and can build distrust in the project. Bringing the team together to discuss team accountability is a good plan, but it does not address the issue directly.

Reinforcing positive behavior will encourage other members of the team to perform positively as well. In this case, Cassie shared one of her strengths, resulting in the project hitting its targets. Doing nothing will not reinforce this behavior with the team. Although privately speaking with Cassie is a kind gesture, it will not reinforce the behavior with the team.

Paul knows that another project could use these hours in their project and take advantage of the contractor rate the company has secured. What kind of risk response should Paul apply?
Accept
Mitigate
Correct answer
Share
Avoid
Overall explanation
Paul should share this positive risk with the partner project, allowing them to benefit from this unexpected event. The positive risk is the cost of the hours and Paul not wasting the hours with the vendor doing little work in the project but still billing for the waiting time. Mitigation attempts to minimize risk or the chance of a risk happening. Because this risk is a benefit, it should not be avoided. Accepting would only result in Paul not sharing these extra hours with the vendor. Avoidance is a risk response for negative risks to prevent a risk from impacting the project.

The correct answer is to conduct a fishbone analysis. A fishbone analysis is used to categorize the potential problems in a project. A fishbone diagram is typically used for root cause analysis, combining brainstorming and a sort of mind map template. A check-in analysis is not a valid project management term, so this choice is incorrect.

Penalty, cost, and risk
Correct answer
Benefit, penalty, cost, and risk
Benefit, scope, time, and quality
Scope, time, and quality
Overall explanation
The benefit, penalty, cost, and risk are evaluated with the Requirements Prioritization Model. The other choices are not the valid areas rated for the Requirements Prioritization Model, which includes benefit, penalty, cost, and risk. Scope, time, and quality are terms that typically apply more often to projects, not requirements.

Bernie’s agile team has a decision to make. It is decided that they will use the thumbs up/down/sideways decision model. It’s understandable what the thumbs up and down mean but what does the thumb sideways mean?
A thumb sideways means a team member does not care either way.
A thumb sideways means a team member does not have enough information to vote.
A thumb sideways means a team member is unable to make a decision.
Correct answer
A thumb sideways means a team member has a question that needs to be further discussed.
Overall explanation
Team members who vote thumb sideways have a concern or issue with the decision that needs to be discussed further. The other responses are incorrect because a person voting sideways does not mean they do not care, are unable to decide, or do not have enough information.

Roger is the project manager for a business that specializes in gas engineering. Recent legislation was passed by the federal government that restricts the use of lead in the gas's chemical composition, which is the primary component used in gases at Roger's company. Which of the following choices is not a project management knowledge area that Roger should assess through integrated change control for projects currently underway?
Correct answer
Technological
Procurement
Schedule
Cost
Overall explanation
Although technological requirements will need to be reevaluated to design a new type of compliant gas, these requirements are not classified as a project management body of knowledge. Technological changes likely affect project scope, which is a project management knowledge area reviewed during integrated change control. When there is a change in a project, the change is evaluated for its effect on all the project management knowledge areas: scope, schedule, cost, quality, human resources, communication, risk, procurement, and stakeholders.

Bevan is a project manager tasked to install a new elevator system into a building. The project will temporarily relocate staff into another building while work is in progress. The project encompasses installing new double-sided windowpanes for the offices, refurbishing the offices, installing and testing the elevator, and returning the employees to their new offices. Bevan is working on a project management plan that will allow each milestone to be accomplished within two months of each other. Which term best describes this section of work involved in the overall project?
Correct answer
Project phase
Project life cycle
Project governance
Phase gate
Overall explanation
A project phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in completing one or more deliverables. The activities shown above suggest that they must be completed in a sequential order to produce each deliverable. Project governance is the framework, functions, and processes that guide project activities to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organization, strategic, and operational goals. The project life cycle is the series of phases a project passes through to completion. A phase gate is a review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue, modify, or end the project or program and confirms if the phase has fulfilled the exit criteria and is eligible to move to the next phase. This is also known as a phase review, stage gate, kill point, phase entrance, or phase exit.

You need a vendor to ship a piece of software for your project immediately so your project team can install the software over the holiday weekend. However, because of the holiday weekend, no one will be able to accept the package at the office when the delivery company attempts to deliver the package. Which one of the following is an example of an appropriate workaround?
Correct answer
Have the vendor deliver the software to one of the team member's homes, so they have the software delivered directly to them.
Demand a discount from the vendor because of the shipping error.
Fly to the vendor's location to pick up the package in person.
Do not start the project work activities until after the holiday when the mailroom can accept the package.
Overall explanation
This workaround enables the project team member to receive the software before the project is scheduled to start. Although this solution may create additional risks, the project manager and the project team member must be in agreement to accept these risks. Larger organizations may never allow such a solution, while smaller organizations would have no problem with the risk response. Remember: always to select the best answer for your PMP exam, even if none of the answers seems appealing. This will delay the project. This workaround will increase costs and would be a waste of time. There is no error with the shipping. A discount would not get the software to the project team member's home as needed.

Shana is a project manager for an electrical organization seeking to switch to a cleaner energy source. While conducting a periodic audit of the recently installed solar panel field, Shana discovers that none of the panels are storing energy. After an extensive evaluation, Shana determined that the solar panels were not correctly installed. Which of the associated terms best describes the scenario above?
Prevention costs
Correct answer
Internal failure costs
External failure costs
Appraisal costs
Overall explanation
Internal failure costs are related to the nonconformance of the solar panels to receiving the required amount of energy. Shana found this problem from a periodic evaluation, and it is considered a failure found by the project. Appraisal costs are costs that measure the quality of the product being developed and include testing and inspections. Prevention costs are the cost to build a quality product and include training. External failure costs are found by the customer and include warranty work and lost business.

Fred is managing a construction project in the Southwest United States. Fred is pleased because the project is 70% complete. He is ahead of schedule, under budget, and his primary stakeholders are satisfied as well. Before construction began, Fred worked with his company’s legal team to ensure that his project was zoned correctly and had all applicable permits to begin construction. Fred accompanied his legal team to all meetings with local municipalities to look for any red flags or potential hang-ups to the process. There were none, and his legal team gave him the green light to build. However, at this late stage in the process, a group of indigenous people filed a lawsuit challenging the project, citing religious and environmental issues. They have also stated that the land belongs to them based on a treaty from the 1800s. What should Fred do?
Keep building because he has the permits.
Correct answer
Stop construction temporarily and consult with his legal team on the next steps.
Deed the property over to the group of indigenous people
Ignore the lawsuit because the concerns and treaty are out of date.
Overall explanation
Since Fred is ahead of schedule and budget, he should momentarily stop construction and consult with his legal counsel immediately. The legal team can help him assess the merits of the lawsuit and claims. This also allows Fred to work with his sponsor and key stakeholders to develop a peaceful strategy to deal with the indigenous people's concerns. While Fred and his legal counsel may have cleared all the legal red tape, they failed to understand the people's concerns in the community, and now they have to work with stakeholders who do not feel acknowledged. Just because he has the permits does not mean it is best for the project to move forward. Fred and his organization cannot ignore the lawsuit, so this choice is not the best option. Deeding the property would stop the project, and it is unlikely that Fred’s organization would want to stop the project at this juncture.

Question 26
Skipped
What would you recommend to a colleague who asks you how to ensure that impediments are addressed?
Ask what the status of the impediment is at every daily standup meeting.
Correct answer
Ensure that each impediment is assigned an impediment owner who is responsible for addressing it.
The product owner is responsible for addressing each impediment.
As long as every impediment is recorded in the impediment backlog, they will all get addressed.
Overall explanation
Each impediment needs an owner who is responsible for addressing it and understanding the status. Without an impediment owner, impediments are unlikely to be addressed promptly. Asking about the status in a daily standup meeting is not sufficient. It is not the product owner's responsibility to address each impediment; it is the responsibility of the scrum team and scrum master. Without an impediment owner, impediments are unlikely to be addressed promptly, making noting the impediment in the impediment backlog insufficient.

In a status meeting, Ron, a team member, reports that several deliverables released to the project customer are being returned after failing the customers' quality checks. What should Nancy do next?
Implement more quality inspections.
Do nothing. Some amount of poor quality is expected.
Onboard a new quality analyst.
Correct answer
Investigate the root cause of the poor quality.
Overall explanation
Nancy should determine the root cause of the poor quality and adjust accordingly. Understanding the root cause of why the internal quality control activities are failing is the first step. Before adding more quality inspections, Nancy should understand the root cause of the problem. There may be adequate internal quality inspections, but the team may not be doing them properly or inspecting the wrong components. Adding a quality analyst is not the best choice as Nancy's next action. It would be best to find the root cause, then respond accordingly. Doing nothing is not going to solve the returned work and poor performance. Nancy needs to understand what is happening with the quality and the root cause of the returned deliverables.

Gabe is a project manager for an electrical organization seeking to switch to a cleaner energy source. The project is currently in its completion phase, and the organization is preparing to halt its use of fossil fuels. However, a wildfire runs rampant throughout the nearby field and causes over $1,000,000 of solar panel damage. Many customers report a power outage in their homes and submit these reports to the organization. Which of the associated terms best describes the scenario above?
Internal failure costs
Prevention costs
Correct answer
External failure costs
Appraisal costs
Overall explanation
External failure costs are related to the nonconformance of the solar panels producing energy because of the wildfire. Due to the customer discovering this problem, which will likely result in lost business, it is considered an external failure cost. Appraisal costs are costs that measure the quality of the product being developed and include testing and inspections. Internal failure costs are failures found by the project and include scrap or the cost to repair the product. Prevention costs are the cost to build a quality product and include training.

Do nothing. The other stakeholders will catch the new ones up.
Tell the team about the new stakeholders.
Correct answer
Update the stakeholder register.
Invite the new stakeholders to a kickoff meeting.
Overall explanation
Changes to Project Windmill's stakeholders should be a signal for Ursula to update her stakeholder register. Updating the stakeholder register ensures the project manager considers the stakeholder's needs, concerns, communication requirements, and engagement in the project. For your exam, note that as a general rule, when new stakeholders are introduced to a project, choose answers that indicate updating the stakeholder register first. Kickoff meetings are only at the start of projects. Telling the team about the new stakeholders is not ideal as Ursula has not yet had a chance to analyze the stakeholders. Doing nothing risks alienating the new stakeholders.

Patricia feels that her company, Acme Corporation, has reached the most effective operational level possible within her team, the DevOps Destroyers. However, she does not believe that other departments have understood their team well over the past few months, and the company's overall effectiveness has suffered. How are they most likely to have implemented the agile mindset at Acme?
Correct answer
They have most likely to have implemented an agile mindset in the DevOps Destroyers, but not across the entire organization
You cannot tell what Acme is likely to have implemented, given the limited information.
They have implemented agile across the enterprise, but the other teams are just slower to catch on than the DevOps Destroyers
Acme has implemented only a waterfall mindset across the entire organization.
Overall explanation
When agile is implemented in one team only, the team will likely experience effectiveness but feel that they are not in sync with other teams to produce the highest level of effectiveness across the organization. If only one project team is effective, but there are concerns about the rest, likely, an agile mindset has only been implemented in that one team. There is enough information in the question to make an educated guess that one team is operating efficiently with an agile mindset. A waterfall mindset is not the most likely choice when one team is operating at peak effectiveness.

Top-down budgeting
Correct answer
Bottom-up estimating
Overall explanation
Because it provides the most accurate estimates, bottom-up estimating is the correct response. The project manager starts at the bottom, or zero, and then accounts for each project cost. Top-down budgeting is incorrect because it does not reflect the most accurate method of estimate creation. Parametric estimating is incorrect because it does not reflect the most accurate method of creating an estimate.

Incremental
Kanban
Agile
Predictive/plan-driven
Overall explanation
The incremental methodology is best suited for projects with dynamic requirements, as well as frequent small deliveries. Additionally, it should be used for projects where speed to deliver small increments is an important goal. A predictive methodology, also known as plan-driven or waterfall, is used when the scope is known before project work begins. Kanban utilizes a signboard that pulls tasks from the queue into execution to completion of the task. Agile is both an iterative and incremental approach that delivers value frequently.

Reduce estimates and add the additional budget to the management reserve.
Accept the estimate because you trust all your project team's resources, and project teams are responsible for estimates.
Correct answer
Ask the resource responsible for the estimate to explain the difference and bring supporting information to you.
Overall explanation
The project manager needs justification for the difference in the cost estimates between this and past projects. The PM should ask the resource responsible for the estimate to provide the supporting information to explain this difference. In the case that there is a valid reason, the estimate may be accepted. You can trust all your project team members, but this does not mean you do not seek to clarify estimates that appear to be flawed or unusual.

Ignore the stakeholder. They do not have much influence, so they are not a problem.
Ask a junior team member to provide daily updates to the stakeholder.
Ask another stakeholder to speak with the upset stakeholder to appease them.
Correct answer

Overall explanation
Despite this stakeholder's low influence on the project, Isobel should ensure they receive their updates. This will reduce the risk of this stakeholder becoming a liability. Ignoring a stakeholder is never a good idea. Despite their lower influence, this stakeholder could still become problematic for Isobel's project. Asking another stakeholder to speak with the challenging stakeholder will not resolve the existing challenge.

You also develop a spreadsheet to figure out how long it takes guests to RSVP. In the spreadsheet, you enter the number of guests and their zip codes to provide you with the duration. What are the two estimating tools you have used to plan resources for the wedding?
Expert judgment and alternative analysis.
Bottom-up estimating and analogous estimating.
Correct answer
Bottom-up estimating and parametric estimating.
Alternative analysis and published estimating data.
Overall explanation
Breaking the activities down to their lowest level to estimate duration is a bottom-up estimating technique. Utilizing statistics to calculate the duration of tasks is an example of a parametric estimating method. Alternative analysis means you examine different solutions, such as different venues to host the wedding reception. Published estimating data is usually software-based to predict how long activities may take depending on the equipment, material, and resources. Expert judgment means you utilize an expert for decisions, such as a wedding planner. Analogous estimating means you create an analogy to a past project, such as how long it took the bride's cousin Maria to set up her third wedding reception.

This is referent power because the project team knows the project manager personally. Formal power happens when the project manager is assigned to the role of the project manager, but there is no real authority behind the project manager. This is sometimes called positional power. Coercive power means the team fears what the project manager can do, such as a bad review.

Day-to-day communication is vital to the success of a project. Not all communication can be done through emails or text. There is a need for daily face-to-face discussion within a set time frame so that everyone can manage time wisely. As the lead project manager, you have decided to incorporate a daily meeting to include vital stakeholders and team members. What is this daily meeting called?
Planning and collaboration
Correct answer
Daily standups
Daily review
Steering group
Overall explanation
Daily standups align with agile methodology. Everyone who attends these meetings has a defined role within the project that ensures participation. This meeting's timebox is usually no longer than 15 minutes, and a Kanban or task board is often used. This allows stakeholders and team members to discuss and address important topics of the project. Planning and collaboration are good concepts, but the daily standup is more specific to the scenario, so it is the better choice for the question. Steering groups are not quick and do not provide daily insight into the project work.

Anyone who is not staying engaged will be reported to their manager.
To set precedence, the first person who is not staying engaged will be replaced.
Anyone who is not staying engaged will not be invited to future meetings.
Overall explanation
Give credit where credit is due by reporting on stakeholders' contributions. This can be done in a status report or steering committee report and will help maintain their interest in the project, encourage continuous involvement, and keep their involvement public. The other responses are incorrect. To "tattle" on a person or eliminate a team member or stakeholder is not the correct approach to take in this situation.

Julie's team wants to use personas on their project to resolve some recent project issues. It is most likely that her team experienced
Too much focus on a given scenario
Correct answer
Issues with a focus on the features that users will find valuable
The inappropriate intrusion of the product owner
A lack of communication in their daily standup meetings
Overall explanation
Personas are used to focus on the features that users will find valuable, as they describe the user in more detail. Personas have nothing to do with the intrusion of the product owner. Personas have nothing to do with too much focus on a given scenario. Standups are meant for figuring out how to deliver, not what to deliver.

Edward is working on the construction of a ship for a major cruise company. The ship's overall frame has been constructed, and Edward has been authorized to have the ventilation, electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic systems installed at the same time. Although some system components are dependent on other systems to be placed into commission, Edward is confident that he can have each contractor install their respective hardware components simultaneously. What kind of relationship describes the scenario above?
Correct answer
Overlapping relationship
Sequential relationship
Phase gate relationship
Project dependency relationship
Overall explanation
Overlapping relationships contain phases that start before the previous phase ends and increase rework risk if something from the previous phase directly affects the next phase. Project dependency relationship is not a valid term for the PMP exam. Sequential relationships contain consecutive phases that start only when the previous phase is complete, eliminating uncertainty but may also eliminate the option for shortening a project's schedule. Phase gate relationship is not a valid term for the PMP exam.

Xavier is the project manager for a new vehicle model. He is currently monitoring crash tests of the car and is gathering data to determine the acceptance criteria for the vehicle to be mass-produced. Which of the following methodologies would best be used in this scenario?
Correct answer
Iterative
Predictive/plan-driven
Agile
Cinnamon roll
Overall explanation
The iterative methodology is best suited for projects with dynamic requirements and repeated activities until they are deemed correct. In this scenario, crash test models will allow Xavier to determine what features need to improve the vehicle's safety acceptance criteria. A predictive methodology, also known as plan-driven or waterfall, is used when the scope is known before project work begins. The cinnamon roll is a predictive project type similar to the waterfall approach to project management. Agile methodology has both an iterative and incremental approach that delivers value frequently.

As a scrum master, you facilitate a product backlog grooming workshop with the product owner. You have many stakeholders and the entire team to break down the epics and user stories by complexity and effort. Doing so is a crucial process for the sprint planning session. Accuracy and team buy-in are critical, and the workshop is time-boxed to maintain a sharp focus. Which agile estimation method would you recommend to a large team dealing with a complex product?
Dot voting
Planning poker
Correct answer
The bucket system
Affinity estimating
Overall explanation
The bucket system is the most time-efficient option in this scenario. It is an excellent agile estimation technique to use if you have many items and a big team. The bucket system creates "buckets" of different-sized stories. The team would first identify small stories and put them in a bucket with a low point, for example, three. Now all other stories are put in buckets according to size measured against the smaller story items. Dot voting lets the stakeholders and team vote on requirements using dot stickers and is not a good approach for many requirements and sizing. Planning poker is an agile estimating technique using poker cards to vote on the size of user stories. It is a good approach for smaller teams but is not very fast. Affinity estimating is a good technique use when the team, stakeholders, and the number of user stories is relatively small. It is similar to the bucket system but not as speedy.

Jared’s project sponsor has asked him to locate a software package that can serve as a central repository for all project information. For key performance metrics, the sponsors would like for this software to capture, store, and analyze data. In addition, this software should help with report completion, data analysis, and track the project’s overall performance. What kind of system is Jared’s project sponsor requesting?
Earned value management system
Correct answer
Reporting system
Project management information system
Integrated change control system
Overall explanation
Jared’s project sponsor is requesting a reporting system, a system that helps the project manager in the creation of reports. A reporting system also allows stakeholders to use pull communications to monitor the project’s progress. Earned value management helps predict and measure the performance of a project. While it is a nice addition to reporting, it is not required for a reporting system. A project management system is a project management software tool that creates reports and assists the project manager in managing the reports. The integrated change control system examines how a change may affect an entire project as part of change control.

Raj will work with Noratech employees and developers who are contract-based, with information from the National State Park Service, local communities, and hikers from across America. To ensure that Raj has captured all the project stakeholders, he and his team will first complete a stakeholder analysis. For this project, what are the three logical steps to stakeholder analysis?
Identify stakeholders, confirm the project scope, communicate the project plan
Identify the stakeholders, meet with stakeholders to address concerns, create a stakeholder response plan
Identify stakeholders, anticipate stakeholder responses, create a response strategy
Correct answer
Identify stakeholders, prioritize stakeholders, anticipate stakeholder responses
Overall explanation
The three logical steps to stakeholder analysis are first to identify the project stakeholders; prioritize the stakeholders by their influence and role in the project; predict stakeholder responses to project issues, concerns, and requirements. The other responses are incorrect because they do not show the process of stakeholder analysis in the proper order. Even though all responses begin with the correct step of stakeholder identification, they do not proceed in the proper order with stakeholder prioritization and, finally, anticipating stakeholder responses.

In comparison, her company tends to place orders two days before they need to be delivered. How is the project manager delivering project value?
Constructing key performance indicators
Correct answer
Identifying needs
Mapping stakeholders
Formalizing objectives
Overall explanation
Identifying needs is the process of helping stakeholders recognize the critical factors for their program's success. Formalizing objectives is the articulation of the collective goals of a project's stakeholders. Mapping stakeholders helps to prioritize project inputs and clarify project goals. Constructing key performance indicators, or KPIs, allows stakeholders to measure the value provided by their project.

What is the most likely response Robert will have for Suzanne if she asks why he is doing this?
Robert's boss is nervous the project is not going well.
Robert does not trust the project team to do good work.
Correct answer
Robert is performing a quality inspection to help assure quality.
Surprise inspections keep the team on their toes.
Overall explanation
Quality assurance is an inspection-driven event that should be performed multiple times throughout the project. By inspecting items before they are delivered, Robert gives the team a chance to catch any errors. It is unlikely Robert does not trust the team. Surprise inspections can keep the team on their toes, but they can also erode trust. It is unlikely Robert's boss is nervous about the project.

Project gate
Overall explanation
A phase gate is a review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue, modify, or end the project or program and confirms if the phase has fulfilled the exit criteria and is eligible to move to the next phase. This is also known as a phase review, stage gate, kill point, phase entrance, or phase exit. The project life cycle is the series of phases a project passes through to completion.

As a certified scrum master (CSM) for your project team, what type of leadership qualities should you exemplify for your team?
A scrum master should set an example for the project team displaying how tasks and assignments should be completed.
The role of the scrum master is to lead the project team by removing roadblocks and barriers.
A scrum master is not a leader on the project. Instead, the scrum master's role is to manage the projects and ensure timely task completion and customer satisfaction.
Correct answer
A scrum master should have a servant leader mindset. Their role is to ensure the project team has everything they need to be successful, and they ensure that there are no roadblocks preventing project work from being completed.
Overall explanation
A scrum master should have servant leadership qualities, which support and assist the team in carrying out the tasks needed to complete the project. This answer is technically correct, but you should always choose the answer that best answers the question. The scrum master does not show the team how to complete the tasks but allows the team to be self-led and determine who will do what tasks and the best way to complete the work.

He is most worried about learning the language and finding food to his liking. Soon after starting the project, a subset of American politicians took China to task for trade practices and alleged human rights abuses. Direct war is unlikely, but a colder relationship between the two nations is apparent. How should Tommy proceed for the duration of the project?
Join local protests about the issues at hand.
Correct answer

He should work with his company to navigate the geopolitical landscape to find out the current relations between the two nations and what changes may be ahead. Tommy cannot ignore the issue and hope it will go away. While the United States has long-standing relationships with various countries, these relationships can change quickly, and often, things are beyond the control of one project manager or one company.

However, a stakeholder has requested through senior management that the project manager complete the project two weeks earlier than planned. Which of the following is the best course of action for the project manager to take next?
Crash the project.
Correct answer
Document the change request.
Consult the project sponsor.
Fast track the project.
Overall explanation
The best choice is first to document the change request. This is a significant change, and the project manager should first document the request and enter it into integrated change control. Always document change requests to capture all the information before taking other actions. Consulting with the project sponsor will need to happen, but this is not the best answer for the project manager to do first. Crashing the project means adding more labor to complete the project finish faster – and this may be a valid response after documenting the change request and performing integrated change control. Fast-tracking the project allows activities and phases to happen in tandem. This may be a valid response after documenting the change request and performing integrated change control.

So far, Queta has developed project charters, work breakdown structures, deliverables and task lists, project schedules, and risk registers for each project to make the consolidation process easier. Which step should Queta take next to manage these projects?
Execute and control the multiple-project plan.
Develop a single project plan for each project.
Consolidate the project schedule.
Correct answer
Incorporate individual project plans into a multiple-project plan.
Overall explanation
Queta should consolidate the individual plans for project monitoring and controlling. This process will allow her to see the results in a single document and see impacts across projects. Queta's considerations include a multiple-project high-level summary, a consolidated risk register, and a compressed project schedule. The project charters, work breakdown structures, deliverables and task lists, project schedules, and risk registers for each project are the project plans, which have been created. Making individual project plans would be tedious and not an effective use of time, especially since these projects are interrelated.

Which of the following benefits best describes the scenario above?
Creating dependencies across multiple projects.
Correct answer
Identify the critical path for all consolidated projects.
Resource sharing
Project consolidation
Overall explanation
One of the main advantages of consolidating separate projects into one master plan is viewing a single critical path across all consolidated projects, accounting for any task dependency between two or more independent projects. Resource sharing, while important, is not being described in the scenario. Project consolidation is combining multiple small projects to share resources efficiently; however, it does not best describe the scenario. Creating dependencies across multiple projects is important; however, it will not generate a high-level schedule for upper management and should be performed after the critical path for all consolidated projects is identified.

Give Jessica so much to do that she cannot work on her daily tasks until the weekend.
Explain to Jessica's boss how this is becoming problematic for the team.
The team can pitch in with Jessica's daily work.
Overall explanation
Because of their knowledge, people selected to be on an agile project are often the busiest people in an organization. To free up time to devote to the project, it is sometimes helpful for the project to hire someone to take over the stakeholder's daily responsibilities. The team needs members who can best assist the team with making critical decisions and understanding requirements. By pitching in to help the stakeholder, the team would then slip behind schedule because they would be compounding the problem. Overloading stakeholders is not an agile principle – it forces them to make a decision where their time is spent. The boss is already aware of the stakeholder's issues.

Overall explanation
The choices present many things the project manager could do in the current scenario. Consequently, performing integrated change control is the best choice. The question asks what the project manager should do next. For proper and complete management of the change, it is essential to look at its impact on other parts of the project, such as schedule and budget. This would likely be followed by ensuring the stakeholder understands the impact of the change, then determining why this scope was not identified in planning and asking the stakeholder if more changes are expected. Although Ron should inquire about additional changes expected, this is not the best choice.

You have just completed the first phase of a cross-departmental project. During your project closing meeting, several project managers highlighted what went well for them and what could be improved in subsequent project phases. Many of these points have recurring themes. Which step can you take to ensure the second phase runs smoother than the first one?
Correct answer
Document lessons learned.
Implement approved changes.
Hold a change control meeting.
Update the risk plan and risk response plan.
Overall explanation
Documenting lessons learned is a process that aims to consolidate the lessons learned from the first phase of the project. These lessons contain a record of positive experiences, such as improvements in processes and sound management decisions, the negative experiences that have occurred, and the points that should be improved identified during the project. The other options are not the best. Updating the risk plans will first require capturing lessons learned. A change control meeting will not provide value because no changes can be suggested for the project without first completing the lessons learned. Implementing approved changes only happens after a change control meeting.

Brenda is the project manager of a software development project, the Pier Project. Having completed a phase, she and her project team must complete the lessons learned register before moving to the next phase in the project. For any project, who creates the lessons learned document?
Project sponsor
Correct answer
Project team
Stakeholders
Customers
Overall explanation
The correct response is that the project team contributes to the creation of the lessons learned document. The project manager contributes to creating and leading the lessons learned document, but that is not an available choice here. Other than the project manager and project team, stakeholders do not always contribute to the lessons learned document. Customers do not always help in the creation of the lessons learned document. A project sponsor does not always assist in the creation of the lessons learned document.

You are the project manager for your organization, and you are working with management to determine the best project for your company. Beth, a manager, has suggested using linear programming to help determine the best project. Linear programming is an example of which project selection method?
Prioritization
The comparative approach model
Benefit/cost ratio
Correct answer
Constrained optimization
Overall explanation
Constrained optimization methods are complex mathematical formulas and algorithms used to predict projects' success, the variables within projects, and tendencies to move forward with selected project investments. Benefit/cost ratios examine the cost to benefits of multiple projects. The comparative approach model compares the current project to others to determine the best choice of action. Prioritization involves assigning priorities to multiple existing projects within an organization.

Ben is the scrum master for a project which just had its kickoff. During a recent team meeting, Ben and his team discussed how the team would know when any given piece of work is completed. What is the best term to describe this?
Correct answer
Definition of done
Retrospective
Definition of ready
Acceptance criteria
Overall explanation
The definition of done is an agreed-upon definition of when something is completed. This may include having gone through various checks, user acceptance, or other criteria. It is beneficial for quality as it ensures buy-in once something is marked as done. The definition of ready is an agreed-upon way to tell when a task is ready to begin work. This may include having the business sign off on requirements or other criteria. The customer uses acceptance criteria to define when something is formally accepted. A retrospective is conducted at the end of a sprint to review lessons learned.

Mateo is a senior project manager at Hook's Drugs who just took over a project from Jada, a project manager who left the company. The project's purpose is to produce a safe and effective cold medicine. Mateo surprisingly learns that Jada did not establish a change control board or change control process for the project. For a project to be successful, why is it essential to have a strong change control process in place?
For the purpose of budget tracking, change control processes will maintain records of all project changes.
To keep the number of changes in the project to a minimum.
Correct answer
So that only essential changes are considered and put into place.
To guarantee that only high-authority stakeholders can submit change requests.
Overall explanation
Only essential changes are considered and used in a change control process. Regardless of status, all stakeholders may submit change requests. The number of project changes depends on how well-defined the project's scope is. Therefore, a change control process will typically not help with the number of changes. It is true that integrated change control examines all aspects of the change on the project, including the costs affected by the change, but in this question, the best answer is to begin with the validity of the requested change first.

Benefits realization management is marked by a process where benefits are identified, defined, linked to company strategy, delivered, and wholly realized. Benefits Realization Management is not a specific process with steps, and the roles and responsibilities can change from organization to organization. In other words, there is no one right way to do it. When a company implements a process of Benefits Realization Management, what are two hallmarks of this?
Support by project sponsor and responsibility
Correct answer
Value-driven culture and clear accountability
Cost-benefit analysis and Value-driven culture
Clear accountability and responsibility
Overall explanation
The thing that these organizations have in common is a value-driven culture and clear accountability and responsibility. Without the commitment to value and accountability, the organization will struggle to recognize, realize, and measure benefits. Organizations that implement benefits realization management have many variables; some may utilize a tool like cost-benefit analysis; some may have strong project sponsors. Since they are driven by value and have clear accountability (defined roles), the culture is primed to institute BRM.

Mitigation
A contingency plan
A transference
Correct answer
A workaround
Overall explanation
This is an example of a workaround. A contingency plan is preplanned, whereas a workaround is a response to an immediate risk. Transference transfers the risks to another party. Mitigation is a planned attempt to reduce or eliminate the impact of a known risk. In this instance, the risk was not known.

Recently, several team members complained to Larry that several tasks were too complex to complete in a timely fashion, resulting in several tasks missing their deadlines. What should Larry do?
Assign more resources to those tasks.
Correct answer
Break those tasks into smaller pieces.
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Have the project teamwork more hours.
Overall explanation
Larry should see how he can break up the tasks into smaller pieces. This will allow the team to continue progress while delivering value. Assigning more resources is not the best answer because the project manager can break the tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks. Adding more hours is not the best answer because the tasks can be broken up into smaller, more manageable tasks. The steering committee is unlikely able to help in this situation.

One of the stakeholders, Nancy, is demanding a different grade of tile for the floors, while the opposing stakeholder, Mike, insists the new tile will cost too much for the project, and he does not really like the tile anyway. You get the two stakeholders to agree that if Nancy pays for the difference in tile costs from her budget, Mike will agree to the change in tile. What type of conflict resolution is this?
Withdrawal
Problem-solving
Correct answer
Compromising
Smoothing
Overall explanation
This is an example of compromising, in which both parties lose something in the decision: Mike agrees to the new tile that he does not like, but he will not be paying for it. Nancy gets the tile, but she will have to pay for the solution. Withdrawal means that one party withdraws from the disagreement, often as an angry or dissatisfied stakeholder. Smoothing is a yield-lose resolution because it yields to emotions rather than what may be best for the project. Problem-solving, also known as the confrontational approach, finds a solution without emotional involvement.

Related risk
Aftershock risk
Residual risk
Correct answer
Secondary risk
Overall explanation
A risk that occurs as the result of responding to another risk is called a secondary risk. Residual risk is risk leftover after a primary risk is responded to and proper precautions have been taken.

Senior management is reviewing the budget for the year 2021 and is evaluating a project's return on investment. Several projects have started in the past four years but were placed on hold. During the review, it is expected that the executive committee will look at those projects and consider whether to renew or cancel them. Which of the following should not be considered when determining if a project should continue?
Correct answer
Sunk cost
Earned value management
Opportunity cost
Benefit-cost ratio
Overall explanation
In economics and business decision-making, sunk costs are retrospective (past) costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. In other words, you do not say that a project should continue simply because you have already spent "X" amount of money on the project. A project that will not recoup its investment or no longer has value should not continue. Earned value management can be a determining factor to continue or cancel a project. Benefit-cost ratios show the number of benefits to the number of costs and can be helpful to renew or cancel a project. Opportunity cost can be evaluated to see the cost of foregoing the value of one project for the value of another.

You are working with your project in quantitative analysis to create a contingency reserve. One project has a fifty percent probability of happening and will cost the project $1,220,000 if it occurs. The risk event is early in the project timeline. If the risk event does not occur, when should the funds for the contingency reserve be released?
The funds are kept for other project issues.
Correct answer
The funds are released after passing the risk event.
The funds are released at the end of the project.
The funds are not released but are kept for other risk events in the organization.
Overall explanation
Contingency funds are set aside for risk events. If the event does not occur, they are released from the contingency reserve for other risk events in the organization. Funds are not kept in the contingency reserve for other risks in the organization. Some project management approaches keep the funds in the contingency reserve for other risk events in the project but not for the entire organization. Funds might be released at the end of the project, but the best choice is that the funds are released after passing the risk event. Funds are not kept for issues, which are risk events that have occurred.

Taylor is assigned to manage a medium-sized project. Although the team consists of experienced, skilled members, the team needs to estimate many activities that have not been done previously by the organization. This is known as the first-time, first-use penalty for estimating duration. What would a project manager advise the team to use as the best method to estimate the activities?
Monte Carlo simulations
Parametric estimating
Analogous estimating
Correct answer
Three-Point estimating
Overall explanation
Three-point estimating would be the best method to use in this scenario because it will allow the team to factor the unknowns and estimate in a range of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. A three-point estimate is an average of the three factors but does require three estimates for each activity to be estimated. Parametric estimating includes the use of history and productivity rates for the work, which would not be available if the team had not done the work before. Monte Carlo simulations are a software tool used to show the combination of factors to predict the likely outcome, such as project duration. It is not a typical tool used for estimating a new type of work but can be used with schedule simulations and risk analysis. Analogous estimating can be used for work that is similar to something that has been done previously, something that is not applicable in this scenario.

Today, your team reports completing a major milestone in the project marking it 55 percent complete. While this is good news, the project was supposed to be 60 percent complete by this date. However, the stakeholders are still pleased with the progress. Based on this information, what is the planned value for the project work as of today?
$900,200
$1,250,000
Correct answer
$750,000
$702,000
Overall explanation
The planned value is what the project should be worth as of right now; you will find this by using the formula of Planned Percent Complete x Budget at Completion. In this scenario, it is 60 percent of $1,250,000, which is $750,000. $1,250,000 is the budget for the entire project, not the planned value of the work. $900,000 is not a valid calculation for the scenario. $702,000 is the actual cost for the completed work in the project as of today.

You have a project that must be finished by July 30, or your organization will have to pay fines and penalties. Management is adamant that you do not exceed $125,000 for the project budget. The project is nearing completion, but you will likely miss the target end date. What can you do to meet the project end date without spending more dollars on the project?
Correct answer
Trim the project scope of everything that is not affected by the fines and penalties.
Add lag to the project.
Nothing. You will have to spend more money to complete it on time because you will need to hire more resources.
Crash the project.
Overall explanation
Although this answer assumes there are things to trim in the project scope, it is the only option that will not increase costs and will complete the project by the scheduled end date. Doing nothing will not solve the problem. Crashing the project means you will be adding resources, which will drive costs. Lag is positive time (or waiting time), so this will actually cause the project to be late.

Overall explanation
A good team leader recognizes the individual, personal goals of the team members and shows the link between them and the project goals. While offering raises or bonuses may motivate team members for a short period of time, it can be ineffective for the long term. During a project, many team members ask, “What’s in it for me?” Aligning the project and corporate goals does not answer this question.

Because this level was met, the project was considered a success. Dee-dee notes as much in her final report for stakeholders. Which information is being used to manage the project closure?
Cost objectives
Correct answer
Completion criteria
Quality objectives
Summary description
Overall explanation
Completion criteria are the specific outcomes that the project was supposed to achieve to be determined successful. Dee-dee's project was considered a success as it met the project's key performance indicator or goal. A summary description is an overview of the project or phase presented when the project or phase is closed; a final project report could be a summary description. Quality objectives are the level of quality in the products or services delivered. Cost objectives are the budget goals for a project.

Abby is the project manager for a project which has just entered its closing phase. Abby has put aside time to review all relevant project documents and artifacts created during the project. How should Abby determine which documents are artifacts that should be archived and which documents should be discarded?
All documents and artifacts should be discarded.
The project team should vote.
All documents and artifacts should be archived.
Correct answer
She should consult her project management office for best practices.
Overall explanation
Abby should consult her project management office to determine how her firm prefers to preserve project documents and artifacts. Archiving everything presents the risk of including unnecessary information. Discarding everything presents the risk of losing important information.

You are the project manager of an agile project to create a banking application for mobile users. Your development team is looking for information on their performance to see if their efficiency is on the right track after their third sprint release. Which statement is true about a team's velocity in an agile environment?
Features are loosely estimated to make planning simpler, thus increasing velocity.
Correct answer
Velocity is an empirical measure of a team's progress, used for estimation, not a goal or metric that measures team performance.
Teams with no slack time focus on individual objectives, increasing their velocity in the long term.
Scrum teams perform at full potential early on and reduce velocity as complexity decreases.
Overall explanation
As an agile manager, you aim to improve velocity by improving processes and removing obstacles by setting a quantitative velocity goal. By removing obstacles, the team is more focused on the project work and can achieve more success in each project iteration. Slack is not a concept used in agile projects, so this choice is incorrect. Slack is a software solution used by agile project teams. In predictive projects, slack is called float and shows an opportunity to delay activities without affecting future start dates of other scheduled activities. Velocity is the number of user stories completed per iteration, so this choice is incorrect. Scrum teams usually perform at limited potential early on and increase their velocity as the project progresses.

You are the project manager of the Bern Update project for your organization. You are currently working with your project in quantitative analysis to create a contingency reserve. One project risk has a thirty percent probability of happening and will cost the project $45,000 if it occurs. For this one risk, what is the amount of funds that should go into the contingency reserve?
Correct answer
$13,500
$15,000
$45,000
No funds are allotted until the risk occurs.
Overall explanation
In quantitative analysis, you take the probability of thirty percent times the impact of $45,000, which is $13,500 added to the contingency reserve. $45,000 is the total effect the risk will have on the project, so this choice is incorrect. $15,000 is one-third of the risk exposure, not thirty percent of the risk exposure, so this choice is incorrect. Funds are added to the contingency reserve before the risk event occurs, so this choice is incorrect.

Gerald is the project manager for the Portland Projects, which is in its planning stages. Recently, a new stakeholder eager to see results in the project approached Gerald and asked why it is important to define everything in the project scope during planning rather than getting to work. How is Gerald likely to respond?
Invite the stakeholder to the next team meeting.
The scope must be locked in during the planning stage.
Refer the stakeholder to organizational process assets.
Correct answer
Defining scope affects all aspects of the project work.
Overall explanation
Ensuring the scope is solidly understood and adhered to will allow the project to focus just on what is important. The scope is needed to be defined so the team can do the work and properly plan all aspects of the project to the appropriate depth. The project scope can change in a predictive project, so this choice is incorrect. Referring the stakeholder to organizational process assets is not going to address the stakeholders' concerns and questions. Inviting the stakeholder to the next team meeting is not the best choice presented. This does not explain to the stakeholder the need for a fully defined project scope statement.

Speak with each developer separately.
Speak to the developer who started the argument.
Correct answer
Do nothing.
Immediately de-escalate the situation.
Overall explanation
Discussions among the team are common, and some conflict is useful in building a solid solution. As long as everyone is respectful and keeps the discussion focused on the best path, Sally does not need to take any action. De-escalation is needed when one or more parties begin attacking, blaming, or calling out one specific individual or group, which did not happen in this scenario.

Jerry wants to ensure that the level of stakeholder involvement in his project is solid at Tarth's Tarps. An excellent way to do this within an agile project is to
Escalate to the stakeholder's supervisor whenever their participation is less than expected.
Correct answer
Include information about any benefits or issues relating to stakeholder involvement in the project and executive reports.
Make a graph on the wall including the number of hours of stakeholder time committed per sprint.
Report it daily in standup meetings.
Overall explanation
The best approach is to include information about stakeholder engagement within reports on the project, including to any steering committees. This method is not the most successful way to increase the likelihood of good stakeholder involvement. Stakeholder time is not tracked for an agile project. Escalation as the primary method of engagement is not a good idea, as it would likely make stakeholders not want to be engaged at all.

As the amount of work in progress grows, you can also expect growth in:
The amount of value provided
Correct answer
The risk related to potential rework
The amount of project efficiency
The percentage of project completion
Overall explanation
The risk related to rework is expected as the WIP grows because more items in progress increase the likelihood of rework. The value increases with completed work, not WIP. An increase in WIP cannot determine efficiency. Project completion, which grows with work completed, cannot be determined by an increase in WIP.

You have been assigned to lead a team that will create a virtual game using agile project methodologies. Your team had been using a web application to assign tasks, but many of those assignments would get lost in the application as more tasks were added. For this reason, your team decides to use a task tracker tool website that uses a Kanban-style methodology. Which of the following options are not a benefit of using tools that create and track tasks?
Team leaders can achieve better coordination using task trackers in virtual teams.
Task trackers are an effective way for team members to view their assignments clearly.
Correct answer
Team leaders can more easily micromanage their teams using these task tracker tools.
Team leaders can follow and monitor their team member's workload and provide an up-to-date list of tasks.
Overall explanation
Virtual teams that use online task tracker tools are typically working in agile teams as well. These tools include Trello, Jira, Asana, Wrike, and Basecamp. One of the principles of agile project management involves self-directed teams. While team leaders can more easily track what other team members are doing, they should select tasks independently rather than the team leader assigning them those tasks.

Rob should confer with his steering committee.
Rob should call a meeting with all his stakeholders to discuss the project.

Rob should take time to analyze his stakeholders to determine the influence and power levels of each. Understanding this will allow Rob to best engage with his stakeholders. Speaking with his stakeholders as a group will not help Rob determine how to manage them best individually.

Over lunch with your colleague, Bruce, the topic of iterative development arises. Bruce says iterative development is better than incremental development when a useable delivery is needed early on for a project. Which of the following is true?
Iterative delivery yields a useable piece of the project in each iteration.
Iterative development is planned in complete detail in the planning stage, while incremental development plans at a high level and develops the scope more and more over time.
Correct answer
Incremental delivery yields a useable piece of the project in each iteration.
Incremental development and iterative development mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably.
Overall explanation
Incremental delivery yields a useable piece of the project in each iteration. Incremental and iterative development have similar but not identical definitions and cannot be used interchangeably. Neither iterative nor incremental development involves detailed planning in the initial stages. Detailed planning is typical of waterfall development. Iterative development means that the project is built in successive levels, but it is not always useable in the first few iterations.

Jeremy has recently received a promotion at a company into a project manager role. For his new role, he is tasked with managing several low-cost projects. Jeremy is struggling to balance incorporating the features of each project into one single document. Which step should Jeremy take first to manage these projects?
Execute and control the multiple-project plan.
Correct answer
Develop a single project plan for each project.
Incorporate individual project plans into a multiple-project plan.
Consolidate the project schedule.
Overall explanation
Jeremy should first develop a project plan for each project. It might be difficult for Jeremy to incorporate all the project elements into a single plan as each project will likely have different project constraints such as budget and time. In this case, it might be easier for Jeremy to focus on the highest priority project and start on it right away. Jeremy should also use any templates the organization will have for small projects and include key project management documents such as the project charter, work breakdown structure, deliverables, task lists, project schedule, and the risk register. Consolidating the project schedules, incorporating the individual project plans into a multiple-project plan, and executing and controlling the multiple-project plan are all performed after developing a single project plan for each project.

Wayne's company has asked him about the resources for his upcoming agile project. They suggest that he use several team members, including some members in his building, others in another building in a nearby state, and a team that includes offshore team members and locals. What is Wayne's ideal resource team if the skills are roughly equivalent in all locations?
Wayne would choose a team in his building and do daily standups together in the same room.
Wayne would choose the offshore team members because they would have more flexibility in their schedule to work virtually.
Wayne would choose the team in his building and those located nearby since they have the same schedule but would be required to set up video conferencing.
Correct answer
Wayne would choose a team in his building and move them to the same space.
Overall explanation
All these scenarios are ideal means of doing agile projects if they can collaborate physically or virtually; however, it is best always to have a physical team in the same space, although we do not always get that option. It is better to have teams in the same room than in the same building. Ideally, you would not want to have team members located nearby. It is best to have team members as close as possible in agile projects if it is possible. In agile, when given the choice of a physical team vs. a virtual team, it would be best to choose the physical team located in the same space as an ideal means of doing agile projects. In addition, there is no guarantee an external team would have more flexibility.

Several other members of the team immediately dismiss the idea and redirect the discussion to the previous topic. What should Pam do in this instance?
Approach the developer after the meeting to see what they had to say.
Correct answer
Wait for an appropriate time during the discussion to ask the developer their thoughts.
Immediately interrupt the discussion and ask the developer their thoughts.
Development teams run retrospectives; allow them to continue.
Overall explanation
During meetings, each individual should be encouraged to voice their opinion and ideas. As a scrum master, Pam is responsible for ensuring each individual has a fair opportunity to speak up. Development teams do not run retrospectives. Waiting until after the meeting is over risks both losing the developer's train of thought and reinforcing the group's decision to override them.

One stakeholder was incredibly worried about Risk Three in the register (pictured below). What should Catherine do about this risk?




Exploit it
Transfer it
Correct answer
Accept it
Mitigate it
Overall explanation
Given the low impact, Catherine may recommend acknowledging this risk, but for a low risk, accepting the risk response can be justified. Exploiting is a positive risk response; we do not know if the risk is positive or negative, but it has a low impact on the project; even if positive, it is not much to worry about in the project. Mitigation attempts to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. Transferring a risk involves a third party accepting the risk (e.g., insurance). Given the impact of the risk on the project, transferring the risk is not the best option.

However, Anthony has had issues scheduling times to create models based on the 3D printer's resource overallocation for other projects. The other projects require the printers to be used to create visual landscapes for those same buildings. Which of the following actions can Anthony take to utilize the 3D printers better?
Correct answer
Work with other project managers to manage the 3D printers for the visual landscape jobs.
Develop a business proposal to show upper-level management why Anthony's project is more valuable for the company.
Identify the critical path for all consolidated projects.
Request the purchase of another 3D printer.
Overall explanation
In this scenario, it is suggested that the 3D printers are being used for different projects with similar goals in mind. Anthony may want to consider working with other project managers to print both the buildings and surrounding landscapes. Setting up a resource pool for similar projects can facilitate resource management, especially if they share the same resources. Identifying the critical path for all consolidated projects will not allow the 3D printers to be utilized better. Developing a business proposal to show upper-level management why Anthony's project is more important will negatively impact the other projects. Requesting another 3D printer is not optimal because Anthony should first try to work with the other project managers to acquire time to use the 3D printers.

Frank is working on a project that is running over budget. His project sponsor has asked Frank to look for opportunities to save costs on the project as the organization has no additional funds to put into the project. Of the following choices, which one would be best for Frank to look at for cutting costs first in the project?
Correct answer
Variable costs
Direct costs
Indirect costs
Market costs
Overall explanation
Variable costs are costs that fluctuate throughout the project, such as the cost of airfare. Examining the project for any variable costs and working to secure a fixed fee for these costs can help reduce overall costs or risks of exceeding expected costs in the project. Indirect costs are costs that are attributed to expenses outside of the project, such as the office lease, payroll, or the cost of doing business. Market costs are not a valid cost type of project management, so this choice is incorrect. Direct costs describe all of the monies the project spends. It is any expense attributed directly to the project budget.

This repair cost encompasses the restoration of a section of the pipeline damaged during a natural disaster. What steps would you take to act on the repair costs?
Correct answer
Assess and analyze the impact, then review contingency and management reserves.
Get a hold of the previous project manager to discuss a risk contingency plan.
Approve costs and start repair immediately.
Perform integrated a change control process and update risk response.
Overall explanation
The first step in addressing a change request is assessing and analyzing the situation and impact. As a new project manager of this project, you need to get a good grasp on the issue. You will need to determine what it will take to repair the problem and the likely cost of the repair. Contacting the previous project manager is not the best choice presented. The last project manager may, or may not, be of much help. It would not be the best choice to approve additional costs immediately without assessing and analyzing the situation and impact.

The best answer is that Thelma should prompt the team for a solution. Agile projects are self-led and self-organizing. While it is good that the team has acknowledged the quality problems, they should also formulate a plan to tackle these issues. Returning those tasks to the backlog is not a good answer as they have already been delivered. Reprimanding the team is not the best option as it will not help mitigate future defects.

The customer must approve any changes to the project deliverable, and the product owner represents the customers' best interests. The product owner will add and prioritize the requirements if they are needed. The product owner must first add and prioritize the requested changes. The project manager and the product owner can collaborate on the requested changes as the product owner represents the customer. This answer is not the correct approach in an agile project.

You are the project manager of a significant technical project that will replace equipment for your organization throughout the world. The budget for this project is $4,000,000. You have currently spent $4,250,000 of the project budget. Due to rework, the project is over budget and late on its delivery date; in fact, the project is only 80 percent complete as of today. Based on this information, what is the planned value for the project?
Zero
Correct answer
$4,000,000
$800,000
$3,200,000
Overall explanation
The planned value for the project, as of today, is its complete budget of $4,000,000. This is because the project was planned to be 100 percent complete by now. We know this as the project has missed its target completion date and is now late on its delivery to the client. $3,200,000 is the earned value for the project work, so this choice is incorrect. $800,000 is the schedule variance, not the planned value, so this choice is incorrect. Zero is not a valid answer for the planned value amount, so this choice is incorrect.

Being a project manager, Alexandra has a good understanding of an identified risk, a risk response, a risk trigger, and issues. A risk trigger is also known as which of the following?
A delay
A cost increase
Incremental advancement of risk
Correct answer
A warning sign
Overall explanation
The correct response is a warning sign, and a trigger is an alert that a risk is about to occur or has already occurred. Incremental advancement of risk is incorrect because it does not accurately describe a risk trigger. A cost increase does not properly describe a risk trigger and is therefore incorrect. A delay is an incorrect response because it does not accurately describe a risk trigger.

Schedule network analysis
What-if scenario analysis
Correct answer
Crashing and fast-tracking
Fast-tracking and what-if scenario analysis
Overall explanation
Alice needs to accelerate the schedule without changing the scope to deliver the product, accomplished by crashing or fast-tracking techniques. Crashing adds labor but increases cost. Fast-tracking allows activities and phases to overlap but increases risk. Fast-tracking allows activities and phases to overlap but increases risk. What-If scenarios are used to predict the duration of activities and the project. Schedule network analysis examines the project schedule for float, critical path, and opportunities to delay some activities.

Kelly is assigned as a project manager for a large technical project her company is running. The deadline for the project is aggressive as several other projects in the portfolio will succeed her current project. During the project planning, Kelly works with her team to determine the schedule baseline and draft a network diagram. Based on the type of project work, the predecessors, and successors, it is revealed that this project, affected by the deadline, now has three critical paths. Which of the following best describes how this discovery will affect the project?
It makes the project more expensive.
It requires more people to deliver the project.
Correct answer
It increases the project risk.
It makes the project easier to manage.
Overall explanation
The critical paths in a project reveal the activities that can have no delay or the project work will be late. While it is unusual to have multiple critical paths, the aggressive deadline can be the culprit. The overall project risk increases with multiple critical paths as there are more concerns should there be any delay on any of the critical path activities. More people are not necessarily required to complete all of the project activities. Multiple critical paths do not increase the overall project costs. Multiple critical paths can make the project more difficult, not easier, to manage, so this choice is incorrect.

John is the project manager for his organization and is managing Project QWERTY, a technical project for the manufacturing equipment his organization uses. His project will update the equipment's firmware and make some adjustments to the metrics the equipment uses in production. While reviewing the resource schedule, John notices that several pieces of equipment will be down for maintenance in a few weeks. The equipment scheduled to be down is the same equipment his project is working on, which will disrupt his project schedule. What is John's best response to this situation?
Use his management reserve to buy additional equipment.
Accept the lost time and inform his stakeholders the project will be late.
Mitigate the risk by borrowing equipment from another team.
Correct answer
Determine if there is other project work that can be done in the downtime.
Overall explanation
There is an issue accessing the facilities and resources the project focuses on, making this a tricky question. The scheduled downtime for the equipment is a disruption in the project schedule, and John will need to determine the significance of the delay and see what the team can do during the downtime. John could also speak with the key stakeholder about the equipment downtime and its effect on the project. Accepting the lost time is not the best first choice presented. Buying additional equipment is not practical as the equipment is what the project focuses on – not replacing the current equipment. Borrowing equipment is not a practical solution because the project focuses on updating the firmware of the existing equipment.

Correct answer
Transfer
Sharing
Escalating
Accepting
Overall explanation
This response moves the responsibility of responding to the risk to the cloud company. Risk transfer strategy means assigning the responsibility for dealing with a risk event and its impact to a third party. Risk transfer strategy is applicable only to threats. Risk-sharing involves cooperating with another party to increase the probability of risk event occurrence. Project M cannot accept this risk as the servers are critical to their success.

During a recent stakeholder meeting, one stakeholder complained to Ben about the time spent analyzing project risk. If the team had not spent so much time worried about risk, the stakeholder says, the project could be on schedule. What is Ben's most likely response?
The project management office has instructed Ben to do this.
Agree and spend less time planning for risk.
Predictive projects are inherently risky, so they need more risk planning.
Correct answer
Risk planning should be continually performed to minimize risk.
Overall explanation
Risk planning should occur during the duration of a project to best minimize the chance and impact of a risk event. The stakeholder is worried about the project being behind schedule and only sees the time invested in risk management. Predictive projects are not necessarily risky endeavors. The project management office is unlikely to have instructed Ben to do this. Spending less time on risk planning exposes the project to additional risk.

Correct answer
Sequential relationship
Project dependency relationship
Overlapping relationship
Overall explanation
Sequential relationships contain consecutive phases that start only when the previous phase is complete.

You are the project manager of a large technical project that will replace equipment for your organization throughout the world. The budget for this project is $1,250,000, and to date, you have spent $702,000 of the project budget. Today, your team reports completing a major milestone in the project marking it 55 percent complete. While this is good news, the project was supposed to be 60 percent complete by this date. However, the stakeholders are still pleased with the progress. Based on this information, what is the schedule variance for the project work as of today?
-92,000
Correct answer
-62,500

.92
Overall explanation
The schedule variance is found using the formula of earned value minus planned value. For this scenario, it is $687,500-750,000 for a result of -$62,500. .92 is the schedule performance index value, not the schedule variance for this project. -92,000 isn't a valid calculation, so this choice is incorrect. 45 percent is the percent of project work remaining to complete, so this choice is incorrect.

It has come to your attention that a vital stakeholder is an introvert and a disabled veteran that does not feel comfortable attending the larger meetings. This stakeholder must participate in the decisions and be informed of the project's varying stages. What can you do to include them without singling them out?
Have management speak to them about finding someone else to take their place.
Demand that they attend, or they will not be kept in the project loop.
Send out a notification to all stakeholders that it is rude not to attend meetings they are vested in.
Correct answer
Engage them in a one-on-one meeting, outlining ways that you can effectively keep them informed.
Overall explanation
Stakeholders that might have a history of trauma are not purposefully avoiding meetings to be noticed or antagonistic. They are doing so to protect themselves and to keep calm. They may have a wealth of knowledge that can contribute to the project, but their past trauma may warrant concessions to be made. Communication can be more effective by taking the time to engage them in a safe setting and where they do not feel overwhelmed. It allows a more controlled environment for them, and you can work with them and your team to meet their requirements. Demanding that they attend the meeting is not respectful or emotionally intelligent in this scenario. Asking management to have someone else take their place is a good option, but this does not address the issue entirely and is not the best choice in this scenario. Sending out a notification to all stakeholders that it is rude not to attend meetings can make the person feel obligated to go and cause additional stress.

Question 2

A new project manager is not sure that they fully understand the stakeholders' engagement and influence on their project. So far, the project manager has relied on word-of-mouth assessments of the stakeholders' respective temperaments, abilities, and interests within the company. Unfortunately, this data is too broad to be useful on a case-by-case basis and too verbose to be easily communicated to new team members during onboarding. It also misses concrete but critical details about the stakeholders, such as their email addresses and tenure with the company. The data is also inherently subjective. As a result, the project manager amends the ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. The newest rule is that the project team must create and maintain a stakeholder engagement matrix detailing each stakeholder's influence and interest in different aspects of the project. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Characteristics of stakeholders
Politics and power structures
Requirements management
Correct answer
Analytical and assessment techniques
Overall explanation
Since the project manager wanted a tool to identify potential problems with stakeholders, they used their expert judgment to build a ground-rule requiring an analytical assessment of stakeholders. This will allow the project manager or a member of their team to quickly assess where a stakeholder stands on an issue before making any decisions to engage the stakeholders. Politics and power structures can inform ground rules but are inherently social rather than formal. Requirements management should be included in ground rules, but ideally, this will comprise a process rather than an ad hoc solution. Requirements management is part of the project scope management activities. Stakeholder characteristics may need to be reflected in the project charter when describing stakeholder engagement. However, they are by and large responses to the needs of specific stakeholders or groups of stakeholders.

Without a tiebreaker, it is difficult to determine the outcome of contentious decisions, and something new always comes up for discussion before a final decision can be reached. The project suffers as a result. Shane decides to create a ground rule for group decision-making. He implements a two-week decision timeline for critical project decisions. Under Shane's system, if there is no consensus on a path forward in two weeks, either a default option or the suggestion with the most popular votes will be considered approved. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Requirements management
Correct answer
Environment and culture of the organization
Communication methods and strategies
Analytical and assessment techniques
Overall explanation
Project managers who make ground rules based on an organization's environment and culture set themselves up for success within that organization.

The team has been using email to send in-process drafts of documents to each other, but this sometimes results in team members editing or stakeholders approving the wrong version of a document. Which alternative should the project manager explore for virtual team member engagement?
Video conferencing
Correct answer
A shared portal
Audio conferencing
Email/chat
Overall explanation
A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. Such repositories are also useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Video conferencing is a critical technique for virtual teams. However, it is more helpful to demonstrate visual components or make contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication. But it is more appropriate for sharing nuances that are not necessarily included in written communication. Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update a large number of people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members. But they are not always appropriate for long-form communications.

Nikhil is the project manager for a natural hair dye that maintains its color longer than its competitors and does not damage hair. Initial focus groups suggest that it would be popular in certain regions of India, so Nikhil begins planning marketing campaigns for those regions. Unexpectedly, India's prime minister mentions the possibility of a 25 percent tariff for all imports while giving a press briefing. This is an example of which of the following choices?
An issue
A change
Correct answer
A risk
A deliverable
Overall explanation
A risk is an uncertain event or condition that might happen to affect the project's outcome. Risks have a probability and an impact and can be internal, or as in this scenario, external. An issue is something that has happened and will impact the project. A change is a deviation from an original agreement recorded in the project documents or unofficially understood. A deliverable is a good or service created or refined as part of a project.

Tate has been assigned as a cost engineer to build a parking garage near a mall. His supervisor has tasked Tate with producing the most accurate estimate for the parking garage and has provided him a two-month deadline to do so. What estimation technique would be best applied in this scenario?
Three-point estimating
Correct answer
Bottom-up estimating
Analogous estimating
Parametric estimating
Overall explanation
Tate should use bottom-up estimating in this case. Bottom-up estimating involves estimating the costs of individual work packages or activities to the most significant level of specified detail. The detailed cost is then summarized or "rolled up" to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual activity or work package. Analogous estimating involves using values, or attributes, of a previous project similar to the current project. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical knowledge and another variable. Three-point estimating takes the average of the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic costs.

Stark Solutions Pvt., Ltd is working to build a learning management software. The software is not currently available to the public while the project team works with a focus group to further develop the product. Before the final version of the software launches, the organization decides to have four beta releases to gain more insight into how the product should operate for customers. Additionally, they want to gain insight into the benefit of the minimally viable product version before the final launch. As the business representative, which of the following would not be an appropriate feature to include in the first beta release?
Learner ID and password authentication.
Learner sign-up and login interface.
Correct answer
Refer-a-friend functionality.
Options to submit a ticket to report issues to developers.
Overall explanation
The ability to refer-a-friend is not a feature that would be a value-add in the first release since the software is still under development and would likely undergo significant changes before the final version is ready for marketing and broader use. The software is also being tested through a focus group and is not publicly available yet. Providing the learners an interface to sign-up to the system would be something that would be desirable in the first release. Providing the learners the ability to use their credentials to log in would be something that would be desirable in the first release. The team would also want to get informed about any bugs or usability issues experienced by the learners to rectify them in the upcoming releases.

They tell the performing organization why the bid is being created.
The project manager creates and chooses the bid.
They allow no room for bidders to make change suggestions.
Correct answer
They ensure complete proposals have been received.
Overall explanation
Procurement document packages list the work requirements to help ensure that sellers are submitting complete proposals. The purpose of the procurement documents is not to inform the performing organization why the bid is being created; this response is incorrect. This is not a realistic response and is therefore incorrect. Procurement documents allow sellers to suggest alternative ways to complete the project work; therefore, this response is incorrect.

The correct answer is an Ishikawa diagram. "Cause and effect" are the keywords relating to the Ishikawa diagram. While a control chart plots the sampling results, it does not show the cause and effect of problems and is therefore incorrect.

Maria has been with her project team for a couple of years, and things are going well. She and the team feel like they perform well, but they do not have any framework to measure their progress. Maria wants to start setting more goals and expectations for team members but wants this to be a methodology that fosters development rather than creates burdens. Maria starts making goals for the team and individuals but needs a philosophy to keep these goals within the right zone. What can she utilize?
Numerical goals
Easy goals
Lofty goals
Correct answer
SMART goals
Overall explanation
Maria should use SMART goals to establish specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound goals. Lofty goals might be appropriate for a high achiever who desires such a challenge, but most people want attainable goals that they can build on. Goals need to be measurable and quantifiable. Maria can use numbers when setting goals, but this should not be the only thing she is looking at for team member performance. Goals that are too easy do not keep someone motivated long-term. Goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound cover so much ground and keep the goals grounded.

Unfortunately, Freddy and Dong Jing have not spoken much since Dong Jing started parking in Freddy's unofficial parking spot about a year ago. Which error should Freddy try to avoid?
Correct answer
Personal bias
Strictness or leniency error
Recency error
Central tendency error
Overall explanation
Personal bias is a non-objective perspective based on an appraiser's experiences and preferences rather than objective measures. Appraisers should be cautious and skeptical about their ability to gauge a person's abilities with whom they have a conflict. The recency error occurs when an appraiser over-exaggerates a good or bad event simply because it occurred recently. Although this is like a personal bias, in this case, the length of time between the incident and the appraisal is likely to mitigate the recency effect. Central tendency error is the habit of assigning a middling rating to all employees for all skills, which is unlikely and unhelpful. The strictness or leniency error is the tendency for an appraiser to grade in an excessively strict or lenient manner.

Constraint
Overall explanation
When workstations must meet hardware requirements, this is considered an assumption, the correct response. A constraint is incorrect because this scenario did not describe a constraint. Risk is incorrect because this scenario is not an example of risk. The order of magnitude is the confidence level in an estimate and is an incorrect response.

Overall explanation
The correct response is a seller rating system, which can help project managers in the future choose the best vendor based on past performance.

Natasha has been tasked with creating a project management office and she will need to build a team from internal employees and external hires. The team members that are mostly internal hires have no formalized project management experience. Thankfully, Natasha has the support of senior management. Based on these circumstances, what aspect should she emphasize in her project plan and budget?
RACI matrix
Key performance indicators
Bonuses
Correct answer
Training
Overall explanation
Natasha needs to emphasize training. Building a project management office is much work and the team needs to speak the same terminology and have a common understanding of project management. Bonuses should not be the focus at this stage; though rewards and recognition are nice, the key item needed is a common project management foundation through training. Key performance indicators show how well the project is performing. KPIs are not going to help the team in this new environment. RACI means Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

Throughout the entire project
Once at the project's beginning
Overall explanation
The correct response is that risk identification occurs throughout the entire project. Planning is iterative; as the project gets closer to completion, new risks may emerge that need identification and planned responses. This response is incorrect because risk identification is part of planning, not execution. Once per project phase is incorrect because a project phase's nature may reveal and require more than one chance for risk identification.

Before Christian's contract ends, his stakeholders reach out to him and ask if he can do another three buildings in another month if they extend the contract. Which project artifact is being managed?
Correct answer
Requirements
Project charter
Customer/stakeholder analysis
Business case
Overall explanation
Managing requirements is a continuous process starting with the initial requirement-gathering session and continuing until the project's close. The project charter establishes the relationship between the project team and the organization, and includes the project purpose, stakeholders, and project team members, and authorizes organizational resources to be used for the project. If the project environment changes, the project manager should review the project charter for further information. The business case is the compelling reason for the project's existence, and closely managing it is critical since any changes are likely to affect all aspects of the project. However, it does not provide information to the project manager on project-related activities.

To help Julia keep track of each requirement's characteristics, what sort of document does she need?
Project communications management plan
Configuration management plan
Correct answer
Requirements traceability matrix
Project management plan
Overall explanation
The correct choice is the requirements traceability matrix which is a document that helps the project manager track and monitors each project requirement characteristic. It also records notes or comments about each requirement, as well as communicates requirement status and completion. The communications management plan is incorrect because it defines who needs what information, when it is needed, and the expected modality. The configuration management plan defines how product scope changes are allowed, controlled, and recorded; it is an incorrect response. Although the project management plan does indeed define the planning, monitoring, and execution of the project components, it is not as good of an answer as a requirements traceability matrix.

After your team's first meeting, the group comes to a consensus on creating a centralized web service that the team will use to develop documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.  What technology solution does this scenario best represent?
The choice of tools to communicate asynchronously
Correct answer
The creation of one space to share and save all types of content
The selection of tools that allow you to create and track tasks
The choice of tools to communicate synchronously
Overall explanation
This scenario describes a place where the team can share and save all types of content. Having one source of information for all team members can build trust and provide equal access to all uploaded documents and files. Additionally, multiple types of files can be stored on the drive, which allows all team members to access them in real-time. Synchronous communication happens when messages can only be exchanged in real-time. It requires that the transmitter and receiver are present at the same time and/or space. Asynchronous communication happens when information can be exchanged independent of time. It does not require the recipient's immediate attention, allowing them to respond to the message at their convenience.

She purges out project info after five years. Bridget is successful but busy. The company is now hiring a second project manager to take on the many projects Bridget cannot complete due to time constraints. What obstacles will the new project manager face in terms of information transfer?
The new project manager will learn from experience.
None, Bridget is there to mentor the new project manager.
Correct answer
Lessons learned and other plan documents.
None, the new project manager has five years of charters to look at.
Overall explanation
Bridget has done herself, her company, and the new project manager a great disservice in how she has kept records.  By skipping over plan documents and purging data, Bridget is forced to rely on memory for things like lessons learned. Recollections of past projects are not as reliable as written documentation. Bridget may not have the time to mentor the new project manager. In addition, lessons learned from past projects would better guide the work the new project manager will be taking on.

Tell management that he needs to hire a whole new team that understands his methodologies.
Have his team members attend training to help them understand how to pay better attention to details.
Correct answer
Find a way to improve his emotional intelligence and ascertain ways to be a more effective leader.
Resign since he cannot lead his team; being a better leader is not something he can do.
Overall explanation
The first thing a project manager should do is understand their own emotional intelligence. By understanding and managing their emotions, a project manager is better suited to lead a team where he can understand and assess their emotions. This will help reduce tension and foster cohesion among team members while encouraging them to acknowledge their concerns. This will also help understand stakeholders and the interaction the project manager and his team will have. Resigning is not the best choice. Thomas can become a better leader.

Penalties are unlikely to be well-received when employees have outside options and are already highly compensated.

You are certified in agile and prefer the scrum approach to project management. You are coaching your new project team and stakeholders on the approach, and they are excited. You stress the need for osmotic communication in agile environments, but the team is unfamiliar with this. Which of the following practices would be most effective for osmotic communication to work in an agile working environment?
Team members who are understanding of each other's culture.
Distributed teams
Correct answer
Collocated teams
Teams working remotely, but with interactive web conferencing
Overall explanation
Osmotic communication is the useful sharing of information that flows between team members working in close proximity to each other as they can overhear each other's conversations. Close proximity near each other and in the same physical environment, such as collocated teams, enables knowledge to be shared and absorbed more conveniently. It is impossible for distributed teams to experience osmotic communication because not all team members are located in the same physical environment. Team members who understand one another's cultural differences are an essential part of communication in a team environment; however, it is not an example of osmotic communication and not the correct answer in this scenario.

Whenever Cale assigns Grant to a project, Grant's work is exemplary, demonstrating an in-depth knowledge of the client's needs and an overarching dedication to quality in his work. However, Grant will only work on projects that Cale explicitly assigns to him, meaning that he is only working on problems and tasks that Cale knows about. With his perception and dedication, Cale suspects that Grant is almost certainly aware of many issues on the project but will not act on them without Cale's explicit permission. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by
Using open and effective communication
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Correct answer
Developing trust among team members
Creating team-building opportunities
Overall explanation
If possible, a mentor in a supervisory role can and should develop trust by giving their mentees a degree of autonomy in the work they complete. This provides the mentee with the confidence to work independently, which allows them to bring up issues that supervisors might otherwise overlook. Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance, but this is more crucial at the early stages of team development. Team-building is not the best choice as the question centers on Grant not looking for opportunities to work on what needs to be completed, rather than only working on direct assignments. There is not a conflict in this scenario to be resolved. Open and effective communication is happening on the assigned work to Grant, but Grant needs autonomy and trust the project manager to do more than direct assignments.

There will be several contractors working on the project along with the internal project team members. During a project meeting, Britney learns that, Mark, a stakeholder, has scheduled a call with a vendor to line up resources for the project but did not invite Britney. What should Britney do next?
Show up to the meeting unannounced.
Complain about the stakeholder to the project management office.
Correct answer
Speak with the stakeholder and ask to be included in the meeting.
Do nothing. The stakeholder can handle this agreement themselves.
Overall explanation
As the project manager, Britney should at least be aware of any contractual agreements and resources that are being hired for the project. The question does not give us enough insight to know if the stakeholder represents purchasing for the company, but it is unusual for a stakeholder to hire resources for a project without including the project manager. Speaking with the stakeholder and asking to be invited will help build a solid relationship and include Britney in the call. Showing up unannounced is not a good idea and can strain relationships. Doing nothing will result in the stakeholder making unilateral decisions that may negatively impact the project.

Tracie wants to get more insight into her team and what makes them tick without prying into every detail of their personal lives. How can she start to do this?
Get the team together for drinks after work.
Correct answer
Ask the team to take a Myers-Briggs personality test.
Give the team an intelligence quotient test.
Learn more stories about the team members through conversations.
Overall explanation
While not definitive, a Myers-Briggs test will give Tracie an idea of each individual and their makeup. Choosing to utilize this resource will help her manage the team as a group and on a one-on-one basis. Tracie might do some team-building with an after-work fun meeting or through conversations, but those things are unlikely to reveal what makes a person tick. An IQ test only tests certain aspects of a person's mind and does not account for personality or emotional intelligence. A good second choice is to learn more stories about the team members through conversations. This takes time and trust from the team, however. After two years, you would think the team would open to Tracie, but there may be more dynamics here than we know. This is a typical exam question, where none of the answers are great choices, so choose the answer that has the most definitive results.

How can Sean validate improvement among the development team as the project continues?
Ask the team at the next retrospective how they are feeling.
Correct answer
Ask the team in the daily scrum if there are issues.
Ask stakeholders if they have noticed any changes.
Trust the team to do what they say.
Overall explanation
The daily scrum is a great opportunity to check in with the team and ask for updates on any issues. This gives the team a daily reminder of the promises made in the retrospective and gently keeps the team on task. Waiting until the next retrospective to ask the team how they feel not only waits for an entire sprint without mentioning the issues it also addresses feelings and not the team's work quality. Asking stakeholders if they have noticed any changes is not the best choice as stakeholders may not see the results of the work until the sprint review or if there is a product release.

In regard to project scope, quality is about finishing the work as promised and is defined in the project scope. Part of what the customer expects is part of the project deliverables. Although the project scope has acceptance requirements, it might not define metrics for quality; this answer is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it defines quality control. Rosa and her project team will inspect the work results to create the project scope to ensure quality exists within the project. This answer is incorrect because although the project scope has acceptance requirements, metrics for quality may not be defined.

Samah will do whatever it takes to ensure that her team is successful. In this way, she is an apt project manager. Lately, she has been an advocate for hiring contractors to help her team. While this increases the team's size, it does not always result in the success of the team's mission since the contractors often have to be trained on specific tasks. One of the stakeholders Samah reports to notices this and suggests that she go on an executive training. On which competency should the team training focus?
Managing quality
Managing risk
Managing stakeholders
Correct answer
Managing cost
Overall explanation
While some projects can be completed by increasing resources and, in turn, increasing costs, some cannot. Recognizing the difference is one of the benefits of learning to manage costs. Samah is aware of the possible risks, so she does not need assistance identifying them. Additional risk management training would not be as effective as managing costs in this scenario. Stakeholders are taking a healthy interest in Samah's work, so they probably do not need more management. She is enthusiastic about and embedded in the work, so the quality is already likely high.

Henry is a project manager for his organization and he is leading a project using a predictive approach. Due to some quality errors in the project work, the project is likely to miss the next milestone, which involves multiple concurrent tasks and decision points. Henry is working with the project team to see how best to schedule the concurrent tasks and other factors that may be affected by the rework and the milestone. Which tool can Henry use to consider each task's pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic outcome in this scenario?
Root cause analysis
Correct answer
PERT
Monte Carlo analysis
Project network diagram analysis
Overall explanation
PERT means Program Evaluation and Review Technique and is a network diagramming approach used in schedule management. Root cause analysis examines the problem for causal factors for the issue. The Monte Carlo analysis, named after the gambling in Monte Carlo, examines the possible combinations of pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic and plays what-if games to predict the likelihood of reaching a target date or goal. Project network diagram analysis examines the start and finish dates for activities to find float in the project network diagram.

You are part of the development team on a project that has just concluded the current sprint. All committed items in the sprint backlog are complete but one. The item that was not completed was almost done. What should happen with the incomplete item?
Correct answer
Do not include the item in the increment and work with the product owner to re-prioritize the remaining work.
Since the item is almost done, consider the completed part of the item in the velocity calculation and then create a new item in the product backlog for the remaining work for the next sprint.
It can be added to the increment if the customer accepts it.
Demonstrate the item to the stakeholders in the sprint review meeting if it is presentable in its current state.
Overall explanation
Any item that does not meet the definition of "done" is not considered complete and should not be included in the increment or velocity calculation. The product owner, the business representative, should be consulted to re-prioritize the remaining work for the next or subsequent sprints. The scrum guide states that all incomplete product backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the product backlog. In the sprint review meeting, the development team demonstrates only the work that has the status "done" and answers questions about the increment. Incomplete items are returned to the product owner for prioritization. The iteration is next extended and partial work items are not delivered or demonstrated to the customer.

Jeremy is the project manager of the Patriot Project, which requires a quality that adheres to federal guidelines. Jeremy has decided to put the project team through training specific to the federal guidelines the project must abide by to meet the federal standards. Of the following, which response represents the costs of these classes?
Cost of doing business
Correct answer
Quality cost
Nonconformance cost
Adherence cost
Overall explanation
Training that meets quality expectations is attributed to the cost of quality, making this the correct response. The cost of adherence is incorrect because it does not describe training as a cost of quality. Nonconformance cost does not describe training as a cost of quality and is therefore incorrect. The cost of doing business is incorrect because it does not describe training as an attribute of quality cost.

Which of the following components, dependencies, or logical relationships best describes the scenario above?
Start-to-start (SS)
Finish-to-start (FS)
Start-to-finish (SF)

Question 50

Using expert judgment, a project manager concludes that some stakeholders are overly concerned about his project's financials. Casual conversations with one of the stakeholders will often lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary delays. The only way to alleviate the stakeholder's concerns is to provide a financial report. Although these reports require a lot of work from the project manager's team, the time it takes to complete them is less than the time it takes to get the project back on track following a delay. As a result, the project manager amends the ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. One of these ground rules is that a financial report must accompany any conversations with stakeholders regarding finances. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Correct answer
Characteristics of stakeholders
Analytical and assessment techniques
Politics and power structures
Requirements management
Overall explanation
The project manager used expert judgment to determine that stakeholder characteristics need to be reflected in the project charter when describing stakeholder engagement. Politics and power structures can inform ground rules but are inherently social rather than personal. Analytical and assessment techniques can be used to create ground rules but are most often used to identify problems rather than solve them. Requirements management should be included in ground rules, but ideally, this will comprise a process rather than an ad hoc solution.

Donna requests a meeting to discuss Sebastian's latest deliverable when a stakeholder contacts her to say that they have not received it. Sebastian was supposed to document the latest software release features in a template provided by the project management office and email it to several stakeholders. Instead, he created a rough document that he saved to his personal computer. During their meeting, Donna asks Sebastian to correct his mistake and not let this happen again. Sebastian tells Donna that he will try to do better, but he is unsure what he did wrong. Donna is unfamiliar with the template and the stakeholders, so she only says that Sebastian should do his job correctly. What mistake did the project manager make?
Not giving feedback
Not practicing delivery
Correct answer
Not agreeing on an outcome
Delaying feedback
Overall explanation
Neither party agreed on an outcome, so it is unlikely that they both have the same next steps in mind. The opportunity to align is one of the main reasons for providing feedback. You may also see this concept as the "DoD" – the definition of done. Without knowing the desired outcome, the project manager cannot practice their delivery. The project manager followed up quickly, so this is not an appropriate answer. The project manager did give feedback, so this is also not the correct response.

Scope management plans
Overall explanation
The correct answer is scope management plans can be template-based. For the record, WBS and project scope change control forms can also be based on templates.

As a veteran project manager, you have a team that has been with you for a while, and you also have some latitude to pick and choose projects when the situation arises. Your PMO has offered you two projects. You prefer waterfall projects and are eager for an easy project after a series of challenging ones. Your team loves challenges, new approaches, and dynamic projects. You are offered a simple and straightforward IT project involving a rolling software update or a more creative project with many question marks. Which project should you embrace?
Schedule some vacation time and wait for another project

Simple waterfall project
Correct answer
Complex project
Overall explanation
As a project manager, your job is getting things done. Part of your job is also to lead and inspire your project team. This is an aspect of servant leadership. While a simple waterfall project might give you a mental break, what about your team? Will they be bored by it? What will challenge your team? While you could let the team decide, it is your job to lead and direct. In choosing the more complex project, you will challenge the team and yourself while most likely providing more value to the company.

A project manager who excels at reading and capitalizing on body language is used to working with stakeholders in person. When their project becomes entirely virtual, they find themselves at a disadvantage. Almost all communication takes place via phone or email, and the project manager has been reprimanded several times for taking what the stakeholder writes too literally. In addition to misunderstanding their stakeholder, the project manager feels that their presence on the project is not as strong without in-person interactions. Which alternative should the project manager explore for virtual team member engagement?
A shared portal
Audio conferencing
Correct answer
Video conferencing
Email/chat
Overall explanation
Video conferencing is a critical technique for virtual teams. It is especially helpful for demonstrating visual components or making contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. However, such repositories are mainly useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication. It is, however, more appropriate for sharing nuances that are not necessarily included in written communication. Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update many people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members. Still, they are not always appropriate for long-form communications.

Bruce knows that the project is slipping behind schedule, and he is getting reports of constant mistakes and frustration about and the project team from key stakeholders. Bruce is at a loss and does not want to lose precious time on the project. The organization hires you to consult Bruce in this scenario. What would you immediately recommend to Bruce?
Correct answer
Training for the team
Increase the budget
Extend the project timeline
Add labor
Overall explanation
Training is always key when a new technology or resource is introduced. When the project team is learning as they complete the work, the chances for errors and defects increase – as will frustration in the project team and stakeholders. Bruce needs the team trained in the technology to do their jobs better and complete the assignments. Adding labor may be a viable option if resources are available that know how to do the work and if funds are available to pay for the added labor. Increasing the budget is not going to help the team be able to complete their assignments. Training the team is the best solution. Extending the timeline may give the team more time to complete their tasks, but errors and frustration will continue in the project.

Refer the team to the project management office for best practices on estimating story points.
Plan a spike to investigate different ways to estimate story points.
Tell the team that they cannot change how they estimate story points since the project has already started.
Correct answer
Solicit ideas from the team and have them engage in active discussion over changes.
Overall explanation
The project team has identified a possible way to improve performance, which should be investigated. Soliciting ideas from the team will help improve buy-in, and active discussion will help the team reach a consensus on moving forward. If the baseline value of points remains similar, the team is free to assign points however they want. A spike is used to investigate new technologies or training for the team.

The project team thinks otherwise as they see opportunities to improve the product, complete tasks with newer technologies, and they like to communicate quickly and face-to-face without documentation. The team is vocal about their opinions on the project work, and Stevie's reply is that "opinions are for the stakeholders we serve." If you were consulting Stevie, what would you say?
Stevie is right; project team members are not stakeholders.
Correct answer
The project team is an internal stakeholder, and their opinions should be considered.
The project team is a stakeholder, but their role is to follow orders.
The project manager is an internal stakeholder, but the opinion of the customer is most important.
Overall explanation
The project team is an internal stakeholder, and the project manager should listen and consider their opinions. Team members have the greatest effect on project quality and overall project success, so it is important to listen and consider their opinions. The project team members are stakeholders, and their opinions should be considered. The role of the project team members is to complete the project work and offer input on their experience. Everyone on the project should work together for the success of the project. The customer's opinion is important when it comes to the project scope, but it is not always the most important opinion about everything.

Appraisal cost
Prevention cost

When project work must be redone because the results are faulty, it is attributed to the cost of nonconformance to quality, which is considered a failure cost. Appraisal cost is incorrect because it does not describe faulty work or the cost of nonconformance.

Correct answer
Stage-gate or phase reviews
Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks
Capturing lessons learned
Defining roles and responsibilities
Overall explanation
Stage-gate or phase reviews are a series of reviews by progressively higher authorities intended to approve a process or product. Stage-gates or phase reviews call for a project review to this point in time, such as reaching a milestone, and if the project metrics are good, then the project may move forward as planned. Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks involves creating and applying a standardized process for communicating and addressing risks or uncertain events that may occur in the project. Defining roles and responsibilities allows team members to act autonomously and efficiently by communicating each team member's project role and expectations. Capturing lessons learned allows teams to learn from and possibly prevent future mistakes while maintaining best practices.

Jake is a project manager with an unusually close bond with his employees. He tends to intuit when they feel concerned about their careers, the state of a project, or the company at large. When employees have difficulty articulating something, he listens and reflects to help them put their needs into words. He tries to do right by his employees whenever he can, and he prefers in-person communication in safe settings where employees can feel comfortable expressing their true feelings. Additionally, when people are upset, Jake can usually calm them down. Jake can do all of this while remaining professional. Which personality indicator is the project manager displaying?
Correct answer
Emotional
Creative
Managerial
Systemic
Overall explanation
The emotional personality indicator suggests the ability to perceive, process, and help manage people's emotions. Project managers that display an emotional personality may anticipate employee issues without consciously knowing why. Creative behavior is marked by the ability to think abstractly or see things differently. Systemic behavior is holistic behavior and is described as working together and for the common good. You might see systemic behavior as the golden rule – treating others as you want to be treated. Managerial behavior constitutes the ability to organize and lead groups of people effectively.

Interactive communication
Pull communication
Correct answer
Push communication
Interpersonal communication

This scenario is an example of push communication: information distributed to specific recipients who need to receive the information. This process ensures that the data is distributed but does not ensure that it reached or was understood by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, blogs, and press releases.

You are committed to keeping this group satisfied and up to date on what is taking place. What is the ideal method to make this information available to this group?
Using push communication
Interactive method
Encoding
Correct answer
Using pull communication
Overall explanation
The pull communication method is ideal for user groups looking for information as the information is posted in a centralized location. A blog or centralized knowledge management system that the stakeholders can access is ideal for this scenario. The push method means the project manager pushed the information to the stakeholders. This approach can mean the stakeholders wait for the project manager to send them information rather than retrieving the information as they would like. The interactive method is when communication happens interactively, such as in meetings or chats. This method waits for both parties to be available to communicate.

Project team members can only use approved mobile devices to open files sent amongst themselves. What technology solution does this scenario best represent?
The selection of tools that allow you to create and track tasks
The choice of tools to communicate synchronously
Correct answer
The choice of tools to communicate asynchronously
The creation of one space to share and save all types of content
Overall explanation
The scenario describes creating tools that allow your organization to communicate asynchronously. These tools enable sharing information between team members even if they are far from their typical workstation. They can be used as a formal or informal type of communication. Asynchronous communication happens when information can be exchanged independent of time. It does not require the recipient's immediate attention, allowing them to respond to the message at their convenience. Tools to communicate synchronously ensure an efficient flow of information between team members in real-time. Tools to communicate synchronously means the communication happens immediately, such as chat. The creation of one space to share and save all types of content describes a centralized file server and access point. Tools that allow you to create and track tasks describe a project management information system.

Overall explanation
An impediment slows but does not stop a process or action. Since the entire team will need to attend four hours' worth of meetings weekly without increasing their working hours, they will need to work slower.

Correct answer
Iron purchased for manufacturing.
The cost of the permit fee for a permit required to start construction.
A $300 incentive fee that a vendor requires at the completion of the project.
Rent for a warehouse that is required for storing backfill.
Overall explanation
The iron required for manufacturing is an example of a variable cost. A variable cost refers to a cost that fluctuates with the amount of work being done. The money spent on the iron will vary depending on how much iron is necessary for the project. All the other examples are fixed costs. These fixed costs do not change in the project.

You are the project manager of the PenH Project for your organization. You are working with your project team to perform risk analysis on several imminent threats in the project. One risk, customer dissatisfaction, could be high if there is an interruption of technical services. In an effort to alleviate this risk, service interruptions are scheduled for Sunday at 2:00 a.m. EST. Which of the following risk responses has been implemented in this scenario?
Contingency
Escalation
Avoidance
Correct answer
Mitigation
Overall explanation
Mitigation are actions taken to lower the probability and/or impact. By doing the technical work and interruption of services for an off-hour, such as 2:00 a.m. EST, the odds of the risk of customer dissatisfaction are greatly lowered but not avoided. Customers could still be affected if they were trying to use the service at 2:00 a.m. Contingency is a fallback or rollback plan and is not a risk response. Escalation is when the risk is escalated up the organizational chart to the project sponsor, the project management office, or other management entity. Avoidance is avoiding the risk entirely – such as having dual services to provide access for the customer regardless of the service interruption.

Natasha oversees logistics for a company that ships coffee from one continent to another. A new client results in the company shipping more coffee than ever. Natasha has one stakeholder that connected the client to the company, but this stakeholder has very little to do with the projects that Natasha directly oversees. When Natasha asks about them, she finds out that the stakeholder only has a token interest in logistics and that their primary interest is acquiring new business. Where is the stakeholder in the power/interest grid?
Low power, high interest 
Correct answer
High power, low interest
High power, high interest
Low power, low interest
Overall explanation
Stakeholders with high power and low interest should be kept satisfied to avoid high-impact miscommunications. Stakeholders with high power and interest should be managed closely due to their singular ability to promote or terminate a project. Stakeholders with low power and low interest should be monitored to ensure that their contributions or concerns can be assessed and prioritized as needed. Stakeholders with low power but high interest should be kept informed of the project's progress to encourage participation and sponsorship.

Karl has taken a role as a project manager for a new brand of soy sauce. He is working with several financial analysts and chemists to develop the project's budget. Since the main ingredient is soybeans, Karl contracts with a soybean expert to understand the likely market conditions when soy sauce production begins at scale. The expert concludes that soybeans were overproduced this year and expects that the excess supply will drive down prices, pending a normal harvest. Which aspect of expert judgment is being used to determine the budget?
Previous, similar projects
Financial principles
Correct answer
Industry information
Funding requirements and sources
Overall explanation
Industry information, especially pricing and supply trends, can help teams anticipate a given project's budget needs. Knowledge of previous, similar project budgets is an excellent basis for estimating a project's budget however is not what is described in this question. Financial principles should always guide the budgeting process but are especially important when determining which budgeting decisions are optimal or prudent; however, that is not what is described in this question. Funding requirements and sources are the foundation of a feasible budget since there can be no budget without them; however, this is not the best choice for this question.

When implemented, Valentina's latest project will have 39 stakeholders and span the globe. According to management, the project's completion should not cost more than $26 million. Which of the following is this an example of?
Correct answer
Budget constraint
Internationalization
Management constraint
Hard logic
Overall explanation
The above scenario is an example of a budget constraint. Management says the budget must not exceed $26 million. Additionally, if most of the product is not purchased in America, the metric for values to be in U.S. dollars may be affected. The method deemed most logical or required for events to occur is hard logic, an incorrect response. Internationalization is not a constraint; it focuses on time zones, languages, cultural differences, etc. Management constraint is a decision made by management that deals with resources, risk policies, or budget control and is an incorrect choice.

Mia is the product owner of a new remote-controlled drone. The drone has been trialed in inclement weather and is being assessed for its viability to provide live video footage for weather teams. Mia has requested five weather teams to attend their next demonstration and gather feedback for subsequent sprints. Which one of the following characteristics does not describe the purpose of a sprint review?
It consists of the product owner and other customer stakeholders
Correct answer
It closes the project
It gathers early feedback from end-users
A review at the end of each iteration
Overall explanation
The sprint review does not close the project but signals an end to the sprint's work before the team moves to a retrospective and then starts a new sprint. A sprint review is a review at the end of each iteration. A sprint review consists of the product owner and other customer stakeholders. A sprint review is used to review the product's progress, get early feedback, and review an acceptance from the product owner of the iteration's stories. A sprint review can also be a demonstration of what the project team has created.

You are the project manager of a large, complex project for your organization. Management has expressed that this project has a strict budget, and they have asked you to do everything you can to ensure the project comes in on or under budget. In monitoring your project, you are reviewing your project's budget report. The report informs you that your project has a CPI of 1.2. What does this mean?
Correct answer
Your project is under budget.
Your project is over budget.
Your project is ahead of schedule.
Your project is behind schedule.
Overall explanation
The CPI of 1.2 tells you that your project is under budget. A CPI over 1 means that the project is under budget. This is not SPI, so any choices relating to the schedule are incorrect. This is not SPI, so any choices relating to the schedule are incorrect. A CPI under 1 means that the project is running over budget.

Sally is a project manager at Cobalt Bearing Corporation, and she has served in this role for the past six years. The current project is to implement new software for the entire organization and will require some travel by the project team members to different parts of the country. During a team meeting, several team members mention that the work schedule Sally has set up for them is unfair. The team believes the travel and deadline requirements are too aggressive for them to complete. What should Sally do?
Correct answer
Ask the team to clarify what is unfair and address those issues.
Remind that team that she is the project manager, so they should do what she says.
Immediately begin devising a new schedule.
Talk to the individual's managers after the meeting.
Overall explanation
Clarifying the issue will help Sally understand the root cause of the complaint and find a better solution with the help of the team. The team may have a valid complaint and Sally should take time to listen and address the concerns. When travel is required, it can create stress for the individuals' home life, so it is important to use caution and show empathy for the added work requirement. While Sally is the project manager and has some authority, she should still listen to her team's feedback. Diving straight into a solution without understanding the problem runs the risk of missing out on key challenges. Talking to the individual's managers does not address the underlying challenges the team is experiencing. The project manager should discuss the issue with the project team.

Brad, a team member, asks what the purpose is of managing stakeholders' activity. How should Jenna respond?
To meet the requirements of as many stakeholders as possible.
Correct answer
To keep stakeholders' expectations in check.
To enact the stakeholders' requirements that will make the most money for the organization.
To gather requirements from stakeholders.
Overall explanation
The purpose of managing stakeholders is to keep their expectations in check. Not every stakeholders' requirements will be feasible nor necessary for the project. Therefore, it is not appropriate to meet as many conditions as possible; many of these requirements may be conflicting. Trying to enact every stakeholders' requirements that will make the organization's most money will be neither feasible nor necessary for the project. Although that may be a project's goal, that is not the goal or purpose of managing stakeholders. Managing stakeholders takes place in the executing stage of a project, and therefore requirements should have been gathered from the stakeholders before the executing stage.

Keith is quickly becoming a fantastic project manager. He is a star in his organization, and the CIO, Helen, is acting as Keith's champion on his projects. Helen believes in Keith's ability and his future, and her first instinct is to trust Keith and do what she can to give him whatever he needs to succeed. Although this is a wonderful dynamic, Helen does not know project management methodology in depth. Helen also does not know the complexity of the technology in the new project Keith is about to start. Keith knows that while he appreciates her faith in him, he will need his sponsor to get more involved in this project to help him remove obstacles to the project. How should Keith proceed?
Keep his sponsor in the dark as Helen trusts Keith.
Understand that he is on his own.
Find a new sponsor with more technical expertise.
Correct answer
Mentor his sponsor on project management and the new project.
Overall explanation
Keith has a powerful ally here. This trust and belief spirit is hard to find, but a project sponsor sometimes must get more involved depending on the project work. Keith cannot keep the project sponsor in the dark – this is never a good solution. Honest and transparent communication is always needed. It is impractical for Keith to find a new project sponsor. The project sponsor is the CIO and likely will not allow a different project sponsor to step in. It would also be damaging to the relationship, and not a good idea, to try to find a new sponsor. Keith also should not rely solely on his strengths. Even the best project manager needs help to remove obstacles and that is one of the responsibilities of the project sponsor.

The seminar is held at a golf resort in Arizona, and all expenses are paid. The vendor insists this is an educational class and not a gift—although afternoons are free for golfing. You decide to go. Which one of the following describes the decision?
You have not violated your company policy because it is an educational opportunity to learn about a product your company will be using.
You have not violated your company policy because there is no tangible gift received from the client.
Correct answer
You have violated your company policy because the class and golfing are clearly gifts.
Overall explanation
Your company policy does not allow any gifts over $50. This is clearly a gift from the vendor to influence your purchasing decision regarding their product. The question does not say you will definitely be using their new product. This trip is a gift. There is personal gain from this gift from the client. Golfing, airfare and other expenses are included in the trip—well beyond the $50 limit of your organization. The airfare is part of the gift.

Due to some recent conversations and misunderstandings, it has become apparent that cultural differences are affecting the project team. You have noticed that parts of your project team in the United States do not understand why tradition is important to their Indian counterparts. You have been considering ways to help all team members better understand the project team's cultural diversity. What would you do in this scenario?
Instruct team leaders to express to their teams that cultural differences will have to be accepted and that they must figure these situations out independently.
Have team members watch documentaries on cultural traditions.
Correct answer
Have the team participate in a cultural workshop to experience the different cultures.
Send out an email stating that conflict and bias will not be tolerated.
Overall explanation
By engaging team members in workshops where they can experience different cultures, you expose them to an aspect of their counterpart's life. Encouragement of communication about traditions and family life can help build better work relationships while fostering further understanding of different cultures. Watching documentaries on cultural traditions is passive and not as involved as the workshop to experience some of the Indian cultures. An email stating that conflict and bias will not be tolerated does not effectively address the bias. In addition, conflict can sometimes be positive and not necessarily a bad thing. Asking the team leaders to tell their teams that cultural differences will not be accepted does not address the issue in the scenario.

Correct answer
A document that gives is used to create the project's deliverables and is a document that lists all of the required work – and only the required work.
A document that gives the project deliverables a description.
A document that gives the project manager authority to move the project forward and assign task resources.

Overall explanation
A project scope statement is best described as a document that focuses on the definition of all required work, and only the required work, to create the project's deliverables. The document that gives the project manager authority to move forward with the project and assign task resources is a project charter and is an incorrect response. A document that gives the project deliverables a description is incorrect because it describes the product, not the scope. The planning and execution of all required work so it may be delivered to the customer is an incorrect response because it does not define the project scope as thoroughly as the correct response does.

However, before you move forward, you will evaluate the risks that may impact your sprint goals. What is the most powerful aspect of risk management when using an agile mindset?
Critical to Quality (CTQ), flow down, and flow up analysis.
Agile projects do not require risk management, as it requires up-front planning.
Correct answer
Repetition of your risk management plan within each sprint.
Using Monte Carlo simulation since you are managing a software development project. 
Overall explanation
The most powerful aspect of risk management is repetition. Going through the assessment multiple times generates an in-depth understanding of the product and may enable your risk control to be more robust. Monte Carlo simulations may not be the right approach and may not be appropriate for the scale of your project. CTQ analysis may not be the right approach and may not be appropriate for the scale of your project.

The project is due for completion in two months, but it will be at least three months behind with the delay. This will cost the organization $150,000 in lost sales due to missing a market window. At a recent stakeholder meeting, multiple opinions on the best path forward were discussed, but no consensus was reached on which direction to take. What should Sarah do next?
Correct answer
Collect each stakeholder's ideas and hold a separate meeting to reach a consensus.
Wait for the stakeholders to figure out the next steps.
Escalate the issue to the project team.
Identify one or two senior stakeholders and use their ideas.
Overall explanation
Working with all stakeholders to reach a consensus, even if there is still some disagreement, is ideal as each will feel heard and represented in the decision. Waiting for the stakeholders to reach a consensus is not a good idea as it will take time and may not result in a positive outcome. Sarah should not escalate the issue to the project team, as they are the people completing the work, not making the decision on the project progression.

Mike is in the planning stage of a railroad infrastructure project that will transit 529 miles across the country. Although infrequent, natural disasters occur within the region approximately every ten years. Mike is in the process of developing a risk treatment plan for the entire project. Which of the following risk treatment options would be BEST suited for treating the risk of a natural disaster?
Avoid the risk
Mitigate the risk
Correct answer
Accept the risk
Reduce the risk
Overall explanation
Natural disasters vary based on the climate and region of where they occur. There are always some risks that may significantly affect the project, but the project manager can do little to mitigate or manage the event. For example, an earthquake could happen nearly anywhere, but there is not much Mike can do to mitigate the earth. Acceptance of the risk probability is the best answer. Mitigating the risk event is not a possibility as there is little Mike could do to lower the probability of a natural disaster. Reducing risks is not a valid risk management strategy. Avoiding the risk is taking every possible action to remove the risk, including rerouting the railroad, which is not the best option.

With only a few key performance indicators and metrics, he can get a good idea of his projects' health which is a good thing. However, his expertise means that Cyrus is often in demand as an advisor and manager and can only dedicate a limited amount of time to each project. Which method should the project manager use to build trust and influence with the stakeholder?
Correct answer
Progress reporting
Surveys
Issue identification
Meetings
Overall explanation
Progress reporting is helpful if stakeholders prefer to keep a close watch on the status of projects, understand the fundamentals of a project well, and do not have time to perform a deep dive. Setting up automated progress reporting in the form of a dashboard or a similar centralized tool is a low-effort way to maintain communications at a sufficient level without over-communicating. Issue identification is the best way to build additional trust and influence with a stakeholder who already has a high level of trust with the project team. It is not appropriate in this scenario since the stakeholder is interested in all the work being done, not just issues. Meetings are a useful way to build trust and influence with stakeholders, but only if they have a lot of free time and prefer to work through issues organically. Surveys are appropriate if a stakeholder requires the input of a large number of people in addition to the project manager's personal input.

Larissa is currently closing out procurements and has gained product acceptance from the customer. She plans to review the other project baselines on Monday to evaluate their performances. What is the current status of Larissa's project?
Her project is complete because she has received product acceptance from the customer.
Correct answer
Her project is not complete because she has not completed the final performance reporting.
Her project is complete because she spent the allocated money per the cost baseline.
Her project is not complete because the customer has not validated the scope.
Overall explanation
Larissa's project is not complete until she completes the final performance reporting. Because she will review the project baselines on Monday, we can assume that this part of the process is not yet completed. Larissa's project is not complete until the final performance reporting is finished. Spending all of the project budget does not mean, unfortunately, the project is complete. A final project report is needed to formally close out the project, so this choice is incorrect. Even with the customer accepting the product, a final report is needed. The customer's validation of the scope was done in the project's monitoring and controlling stage, not closing. Because the customer has accepted the deliverable, it is understood that the scope has previously been validated.

As a project manager, you are working on a new rail transit project and have decided to tailor risk management techniques to meet your project’s specific requirements. In this case, you have chosen to use quantitative risk analysis to evaluate risks to your budget. However, a senior project management member on the team advises you to be cautious when dealing with quantitative risk analysis. What could justify such advice?
Long-term positive improvements can have short-term negative impacts, which may not be suitable for your stakeholders’ risk tolerance.
Correct answer
Risk management’s benefits are less dependent on formulas and rely more on the frequency and effectiveness of risk assessment.
Qualitative risk analysis is time-consuming and expensive to perform.
Qualitative risk analysis is the only method for risk mitigation planning, and risk modeling is not useful.
Overall explanation
Successful risk assessment is conditional on monitoring and how frequently it is conducted. Formulas take boundary conditions into effect, which frequently change due to the project’s environment. In other words, quantitative risk analysis takes time, finesse, and knowledge to do it effectively. A one-time risk assessment will not be as effective as several budget analyses (or other risks) as an ongoing review of the risk events. Qualitative risk analysis is not the only method for risk mitigation planning. Qualitative risk analysis is not time-consuming or costly. Short-term negative impacts may have long-term positive improvements and do not usually speak to stakeholder risk tolerance.

After reviewing the project's earned value management, you discover that your project has a CPI of 1.09, and the SPI is 0.6. How should you proceed?
Correct answer

Do nothing, as your project is currently under budget and ahead of schedule.
Give the team some time off because you are ahead of schedule.
Remove contracted labor as you are over budget.
Overall explanation
You should suggest that additional labor is hired. Your project is under budget (CPI > 1), so you could use additional funds to pay for labor to speed up the project, which is behind schedule (SPI < 1). It would be best if you did not do anything because your project is behind schedule, as is indicated by the SPI that is less than 1. You should not remove labor because you are behind schedule and need to catch up. Additionally, you are under budget, so you do not need to save money here.

Buy-in from the project team and stakeholders is important in any project, but especially so when a project manager joins an organization, and he does not know all of the stakeholders in the project. He needs to communicate with as many of these stakeholders as possible to calm their nerves. Richard's project team is part of the organization's stakeholders that he needs to create trust. Even though the key stakeholders are important, Richard cannot only focus on them because general trust issues need to be addressed. Richard cannot only focus on the project team as he needs the support and buy-in from the stakeholders in the organization. Communication is directly tied to stakeholder engagement. Ignoring the problem will likely make matters worse, so he needs to tackle the issue and give stakeholders the news, good or bad, that they need to keep informed about the project.

Phillip is the scrum master for a team involved with student support services at a major university. He has recently acquired six team members who will oversee one program and report to Philip weekly. Philip has requested that the team utilize Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls to share information. This scenario is an excellent example of what type of communication method?
Mass communication
Push communication
Correct answer
Interactive communication
Pull communication
Overall explanation
This scenario is an example of interactive communications, in which information is distributed between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of data in real-time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, and videoconferencing. Pull communication is where the information is placed in a central location for the receivers to retrieve the communication when they desire. Push communication is where the information is sent to the receiver. Mass communication is not a valid communication method for this exam.

As a project manager, you need to recognize what processes are done in different portions of the project and to what depth. Consider a project team that has reported all of the deliverables created, has completed the project work, and is ready to close out the project. Which of the following choices is not a procedure that should be completed during the project's closing?
Correct answer
The customer validates the scope.
The customer provides project feedback.
The project manager completes procurement closure.
The project manager archives records.
Overall explanation
The customer's validation of scope is not done in the project closing. The customer's validation is done in the monitoring and controlling portion of the project. Scope validation is done to provide feedback on the deliverables to adjust the project as needed. The customer provides feedback on the overall project in the project closing. The project manager archives records in the closing phase. The project manager completes procurement closure in the closing phase.

Morgan is the project manager of the Lucenda Project for her organization and she is in the third iteration of this hybrid project. After several conversations with key stakeholders, Morgan implements a performance improvement plan for several members of her team. Morgan's team adheres to the plan, and the next release is ready two weeks ahead of time, helping the stakeholders realize business value. Morale has improved, and the stakeholders are generally pleased. How can the project manager verify their team's performance improvements?
Improved customer satisfaction
Correct answer
Reduced time to market
Reduced risk of failure
Improved quality
Overall explanation
Reduced time to market is an empirical measure of improved performance. Improved customer satisfaction is qualitative and cannot be easily measured. Reduced risk of failure would be illustrated by mitigation on a specific risk, something this question does not do. Improved quality is not demonstrated in this scenario, so this is an incorrect choice.

You are managing a multi-site project to upgrade an extensive telecommunication system throughout your organization, and some tasks overlap with the operational duties taking place within your organization. At the end of the day, you receive an email from your sponsor informing you that a key vendor left them a voice message, canceling an upcoming delivery date due to unforeseen issues. Which option would you consider as your number one priority after investigating the delivery schedule and potential cancellation?
Cancel the contract with the vendor.
Review stakeholder management plan.
Review the procurement process.
Correct answer
Review the project schedule with the team.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to review the project schedule with the team. This investigation will let you deal with the vendor delay by ensuring that all possible activities can happen rather than waiting entirely for the vendor to deliver the needed items. The stakeholder management plan is not the best choice as this affects the schedule first. You will need to ascertain the effect the problem has on the schedule, then you will communicate that problem to the stakeholder if needed. While the procurement knowledge area is where the problem is stemming from, the process of procurement is not the issue at hand, so this choice is incorrect. Canceling the contract with the vendor is not the best first choice. You will need to understand the issue, the magnitude of the effect, and then take action from there.

Tanya is a scrum master for project KEY, which is currently ten iterations into a twelve iteration deployment cycle. The team's velocity is 30 user story points and it is obvious the team has moved into the performing stage of team development. Some quality issues in the last sprint review caused some concern, but the team has taken on those challenges. Tanya wants to make certain the team overcomes any further quality issues before moving into the next review. What should Tanya do next?
Inform the product manager that the project may be late due to additional quality assurance.
Correct answer
Ask the team about any impediments in the daily scrum.
Perform a spike to explore possible problems before the sprint review.
Add more resources to the project to ensure sufficient bandwidth.
Overall explanation
Without clear information about what specific blockers exist, Tanya will be unable to address them. Tanya should specifically ask about any impediments that may prevent the team from meeting quality objectives in the daily scrum. There is no reason to say the project will be late as Tanya does not know if there are problems in the project work or not. It is best to trust the team, which should be transparent in the performing stage of team development, to report any issues in the daily scrum. Adding resources likely would not be a good solution with just two iterations left in the project. In addition, the team is performing well with a velocity of 30 user story points. A spike could be used to investigate solutions, but it will not be helpful without direction on what to investigate – if there is a need to investigate.

During a construction project, two engineering companies are working together to develop a performing arts building. Maxwell is the project manager for the building's architectural division, while Erik is the project manager for the building's internal components. The companies that Maxwell and Erik work for have had a prolonged conflict. There have also been projects in the past where Erik and Maxwell have worked together and clashed. However, during those times in the past, Erik was going through a divorce and was having a tough time personally. In those past instances, Maxwell dominated the negotiations between them and helped Erik with project decisions. Maxwell was empathic to Erik and offered a friendly ear and gentle advice when asked. Which of the following options best describes what type of needs Maxwell possessed in past negotiations with Erik according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs?
Esteem
Correct answer
Self-actualization
Safety
Physiological
Overall explanation
Maxwell's domination in the negotiations between him and Erik describes that he likely has met his self-actualization needs. These needs are the highest level in Maslow's hierarchy and refer to realizing a person's potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth, and peak experiences. Safety needs are a person's desire to experience order, predictability, and control in their lives. Esteem needs refer to both esteem for oneself and the desire for reputation or respect from others.

Quality consists of figuring out the deliverables' fitness for use and conforming to requirements. As part of project planning, quality has characteristics such as project costs and the project schedule. With these factors in mind, which of the following about quality is the truest?
Correct answer
Quality is driven by prevention.
It costs more money to build quality into the project.
Quality is driven by inspection.
To build quality into the project process, it will cost less money.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is quality is driven by prevention. Quality strives to complete the work correctly the first time to prevent negative results and loss of time and money. This response is incorrect because there is no guarantee that a project will cost less depending on the expected quality amount. Because of nonconformist costs, a lack of quality will likely cost more than quality planning. Depending on the expected quality amount, there is no guarantee that a project will cost more; this response is incorrect. Additionally, because of nonconformist costs, a lack of quality will likely cost more than quality planning.

A company with a large project management office is working on a mentorship program. The company is committed to developing its people and believes that mentoring is a great way to do this. The project managers, project coordinators, team members, and others are enthusiastic about the idea and quickly sign up. The program is loosely structured, and some issues develop, which creates complaints. For example, one team member is being mentored by a program manager. While the project team member is appreciative of the opportunity, she is also overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge given to her. The program manager is speaking about programs and portfolios, and the team member thought she would be mentored on project management. She wants to be a project coordinator, and the program manager is dismissive of that ambition. What can be done to fix the program?
Discontinue it as it is not well planned.
Correct answer
Match mentor to mentee based on their goals.
Nothing, the team member, should be appreciative of the opportunity.
Randomize the mentor/mentee matching process
Overall explanation
A company committed to mentoring is a perfect place to be. This program seems to lack structure, and disparities are being created. A better plan would be to understand the employees' goals and match them to people in the mentorship program. Discontinuing the program seems like a wrong move since the idea has merit but needs better planning and structure to be successful. The team member may be appreciative of the program manager's time and willingness to mentor, but the topic she is being mentored on is not what she wanted from the program. Randomizing the mentor and mentee is not a good choice as this too likely will not align the correct people by their roles and goals in the organization.

You, the product owner, and the development team meet for the first retrospective on the following day. Regarding managing project knowledge, what do retrospectives aim to accomplish?
Reevaluating the burndown chart.
Correct answer
Developing the team through discussions of team-based problem-solving.
Repopulating the product backlog.
Submitting change requests to the change control board.
Overall explanation
The retrospective allows issues with the execution approach to be identified and discussed in a timely fashion, along with ideas for improvements. Retrospectives are a primary tool to manage project knowledge and develop the team by discussing working well and team-based problem-solving. Submitting change requests to the change control board are actions typically associated with the waterfall methodology during the 'Monitoring and Controlling' phase of a project. The product backlog would be updated by the product owner after the sprint review or during the next sprint planning meeting. Updates from the sprint review may be discussed in the retrospective, as these were found defects. But, the point of the retrospective is to discuss what is working, or not working, in the agile project. A burndown chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog or the overall product backlog. Burndown charts aren't typically discussed or updated in the retrospective.

Qualitative
Quantifiable
SWOT analysis
Overall explanation
Ranking risk is based on the qualitative values of very high, high, medium, low, and very low attributes of identified risks; therefore, qualitative is the correct response. The utility function is an organization's risk tolerance and is an incorrect response. SWOT analysis is incorrect because it is part of risk identification. Quantifiable is not relative to the question and is therefore incorrect. Look again – it says quantifiable, not quantitative.

Have Kathy post a hello on the company's intranet web page.
Tell Kathy to introduce herself to everyone individually.
Correct answer
Ask a team member to buddy up with Kathy and introduce her to the team.
Overall explanation
Having another team member buddy up and introduce Kathy will help build a solid connection between Kathy and the team. It will also provide her a point of contact in case she has questions or concerns. Doing nothing will alienate Kathy and make it more challenging to integrate her with the team. Having Kathy introduce herself is not a good option as she does not know the team and may feel uncomfortable in this situation. Having Kathy post to the company's intranet web page is not a good option as many team members may not see the information, and it is not a formal introduction.

Benson is a project manager for a major banking company that is working to improve its cybersecurity program. He has been asked to assess the risks of training employees within the organization on cybersecurity or outsourcing to a third-party cybersecurity contractor. Upon evaluating the risks, Benson has determined that it will take too long to train employees and recommends outsourcing to a third party. Which of the following risk treatment options best represents the scenario above?
Accept the risk
Reduce the risk
Avoiding the risk
Correct answer
Transfer the risk
Overall explanation
Transferring the risk involves implementing a strategy that shares or transfers the risk to another party. In this scenario, Benson has determined that the risk is too significant to train employees. He has therefore elected to pass on the risks to a third party. Accepting the risk involves making an informed decision that the risk rating is acceptable or that the treatment cost outweighs the benefits. Avoiding the risk of cybersecurity attacks in a central banking system is impossible because of the project's nature. Reducing the risk occurring involves implementing a strategy designed to reduce the probability or consequence of the risk to an acceptable level, where elimination is excessive in terms of time or expense.

He begins to research how he can lead his team to help them grow as individuals and help the organization by increasing their productivity by understanding their emotional intelligence. What is the best option Jack could use as a part of a team-building exercise that would help promote emotional intelligence?
Have the team point out flaws in other team members so that the team members could work on their flaws as a group.
Inform the team members that they will see a psychologist and discuss ways to be more emotionally stable at work.
Correct answer
Use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) tool to identify preferences for processing information and how people relate to others.
Have the team go through a weeklong boot camp where they would be put through intense physical training, ending with an obstacle course, forcing teamwork.
Overall explanation
Understanding that people interact and communicate differently is an important skill of a good leader. By utilizing the MBTI, Jack is finding a way that will help his team understand various ways to identify and acknowledge differences while encouraging communication. This can help the team with other areas of project management, including how to interact with stakeholders. Some people may enjoy the boot camp and obstacle course, and others may not. This approach does not really focus on emotional intelligence for the project team. Pointing out flaws in the group can hurt feelings, cause arguments, and break down the team.

Overall explanation
Scope validation, the process of formal acceptance of a project or phase's deliverables, is the correct answer. Quality control is incorrect because its concern is not the acceptance of the work being done but the quality or correctness of the work.

Samuel is a project manager for a construction project for an internal customer. He has gathered requirements from the stakeholders and determines the order in which they should be addressed. While reviewing his list, he notices his stakeholder lists includes individuals of various ranks, including executive vice presidents and line managers. How should Samuel prioritize his task list?
Given the mix of stakeholders, Samuel should randomly assign priorities.
Higher-level stakeholders should receive priority.
Samuel should perform planning poker to determine priorities.
Correct answer
Samuel should assess the impact each task has on the project and prioritize accordingly.
Overall explanation
To prioritize his list, Samuel must understand the impact each task will have on his project. Once this is determined, he can begin prioritization. In a predictive project, such as a construction project, the requirements must all be completed to reach the project closing. For example, a requirement may be a large window in the front of the building. There are other requirements that must be completed first before the window can be installed. This is hard logic. Higher-level stakeholders may have more influence or power, but their requests are not necessarily a higher priority. Randomly assigning priorities is not a good idea as some items should legitimately take higher priority than others. Planning poker is used to determine the number of story points that should be assigned to a story in an agile project.

Expert Solutions, Inc. has hired you as the project manager. You are learning about your project team, and they are helping you get up to speed on the project work. Because this is your first project with the organization, you want to ensure that all factors that could threaten project success are closely monitored and controlled. Which of the following choices would you give your most significant focus?
Inadequate staffing
Poor listening skills
Correct answer
A failure to communicate
Lack of proper funding
Overall explanation
All of these choices would be concerning, but the best choice is a failure to communicate. Communication is an essential part of managing a project. A good project manager must always look to close the communication gap around business benefits, tailor communications to different stakeholder groups and understand the various types of communication. It is also essential to understand how these channels can be effective and perform effective use of standardized project communications practices. Good communication is not just a cornerstone of good project management; it also brings about other benefits in your continued relationships with your project team and your sponsor. Proper funding is an essential constraint to watch; however poor communication is a notorious project killer and one of the primary factors in project failure. Poor listening skill isn't the best choice as there is a breakdown in effective communication, not just listening. Staffing isn't the issue here, but communication skills is where the resolution should focus.

Low power, high interest 
Correct answer
High power, low interest
High power, high interest
Low power, low interest
Overall explanation
Stakeholders with high power and low interest should be kept satisfied to avoid high-impact miscommunications. Stakeholders with high power and interest should be managed closely due to their singular ability to promote or terminate a project. Stakeholders with low power and low interest should be monitored to ensure that their contributions or concerns can be assessed and prioritized as needed.

When Racheal presses the analyst further, she discovers that one of the organization's vice presidents, a high-powered but low-interest stakeholder, has been casually mentioning that real estate investment trusts are becoming unprofitable. The idea has circulated among the rest of the employees, and apparently, Racheal's team believes it. But when Racheal talks to her project's sponsor, she finds that her team is actually working on one of the most profitable products the company offers. The sponsor suggests training to get the team back on track. On which competency should the team training focus?
Managing risk
Managing cost
Managing quality
Correct answer
Managing stakeholders
Overall explanation
Managing stakeholders, especially those with low interests and high power, is a critical part of any project's continued success, if not its existence. If the team had a stakeholder management plan in place, it is unlikely that the issue would have progressed to the extent it did. Part of the training should include the value the team contributes to the organization. Managing quality is inappropriate since the team's project is profitable. Training on managing risks is not likely to yield as many benefits as managing this single stakeholder.

You are the project manager for your organization. Your organization makes phone apps and you utilize an agile approach in your project management methodology. Recently, you have been assigned as a project manager for a mobile application. This app is for a major phone manufacturer that you have worked with in past projects. While you and the manufacturer work well together, the manufacturer is known for requesting many changes – sometimes late in the development projects. Your current project involves several key features that the phone distributor wants on the application. However, the end-users of the application will rarely use the features themselves. What is the ideal method you can take to manage this scenario?
Correct answer
Coach the manufacturer on the agile principles and welcome changes.
Request for a different phone distributor from the management team.
Consult with the phone distributor's manager on alternative methods of directing the phone distributor's activities to another project.
Refuse the phone distributer's request for additional changes.

The best choice available is to coach the manufacturer on the agile practices and welcome changes in the project. You will want to gather requirements as quickly as possible so the team can get to work, but agile practices welcome changes to the project and prioritize them in the product backlog. There is not a reason to shift change requests to another project. Agile projects expect and welcome changes. Changes are prioritized in the product backlog. Changes are welcome, not refused, when utilizing agile practices. The project manager does not have the chance to work with another distributor as this one was chosen by upper management.

Juno is part of a start-up that fulfills small-volume, custom orders for solar panels. Their typical customer is a residential homeowner in the suburbs, so most of the panels produced are standardized to accommodate residential connections to home circuit breakers. Juno and her stakeholders strongly suspect that tax subsidies for solar panels drive most of their business, so when the tax subsidies increase, Juno re-runs the production forecast with the increased subsidy as an input. Her findings led her to advocate for increased production from 50,000 to 75,000 units and to create a new, higher-quality model in anticipation of an expanded market. Which project artifact is being managed?
Correct answer
Requirements
Business case
Project charter
Customer/stakeholder analysis
Overall explanation
Managing requirements is a continuous process starting with the initial requirement-gathering session and continuing until the project's close. The project charter establishes the relationship between the project team and the organization, and includes the project purpose, stakeholders, and project team members, and authorizes organizational resources to be used for the project. If the project environment changes, the project manager should review the project charter for further information. The business case is the compelling reason for the project's existence, and closely managing it is critical since any changes are likely to affect all aspects of the project. However, it does not provide information to the project manager on project-related activities. Customer or stakeholder analysis is a dynamic process performed throughout the project that must be managed when additional stakeholders join the project.

Which risk management option does this represent?
Mitigate
Transfer
Correct answer
Avoid
Escalate
Overall explanation
Avoidance occurs when a team works to eliminate a threat or otherwise protect a project from risk. Escalation occurs when the scope is beyond the project's original parameters, or the required response would exceed the project manager's authority. Transfer entails moving risk to another party, often a neutral third party like an insurer, to negate or minimize the impact of a realized risk. Mitigation requires action to reduce the probability or impact of a risk.

Summer is making significant progress on her project to develop a cheap fertilizer that generates minimal run-off. Minimizing run-off is essential since the farms that will use the fertilizer are close to several major rivers. However, midway through the week, Summer learns that her company is no longer working on the farms due to a restructuring involving part of the company being sold off. So, she will no longer need to develop a fertilizer that minimizes run-off. Summer sends an email to her project sponsor asking if this outcome affects her project. Which project artifact is being managed?
Customer/stakeholder analysis
Correct answer
Business case
Project charter
Requirements
Overall explanation
The business case is the compelling reason for the project's existence, and closely managing it is critical since any changes are likely to affect all aspects of the project. However, it does not provide information to the project manager on project-related activities. The project charter establishes the relationship between the project team and the organization, and includes the project purpose, stakeholders, and project team members, and authorizes organizational resources to be used for the project. If the project environment changes, the project manager should review the project charter for further information. Managing requirements is a continuous process starting with the initial requirement-gathering session and continuing until the project's close. Customer or stakeholder analysis is a dynamic process performed throughout the project that must be managed when additional stakeholders join the project.

Caleb is a seasoned project manager within his organization and is well-respected by management, team members, and stakeholders. As a result, he is placed in charge of a team that consistently misses deadlines and goes over budget. Two of the team members are not on speaking terms but will need to collaborate to complete the project on time, but neither will take accountability when the project stalls. Caleb has tried encouraging the team members to split up tasks and work on the ones they are most comfortable with, but this results in neither team member taking on some critical aspects of the project. Although Caleb is their project manager, both team members report to different team leads. How can Caleb support task accountability?
Encourage the team members to work in their areas of expertise.
Correct answer
Request executive sponsorship.
Promote honesty and transparency.
Create alignment in the different departments.
Overall explanation
If the team members are not responding to Caleb's requests, he should request executive sponsorship to demonstrate that he, not their team leads, is their manager for this project's purposes. This is using affinity power. Encouraging expertise is not sufficient since the team members are already doing so and work is still going undone. Promoting honesty and transparency will not work if the team members are not speaking. Creating alignment in different departments may be difficult or impossible and will almost certainly be time-consuming.

How will she most likely feel over the long-term until others in her company adopt the same mindset?
She feels grateful that her team is still easily able to focus on the goals and information that are most critical to her.
Correct answer
She feels that others cannot focus on the most important tasks, or they are looking at the wrong objectives and data.
She sometimes resents that the others are not helping keep the scrum board current.
She feels happy about standing out as the first agile practitioner at Ace, which makes her work most valuable.
Overall explanation
As a solo practitioner of agile within a company, she is likely to feel that she has a narrow focus on priority tasks that provide value, objectives, and metrics, while others do not. Agile is a collaborative and team-oriented approach, so it is unlikely that Mary feels happy that she does not share the same mindset as the team. Mary’s team is not likely able to focus on the goals and information she finds important.

Noreen leads a team of engineers and designers responsible for building a prototype of a children's toy. The toy can be taken apart and put back together in various ways. When the team produces the toy's first prototype, the engineers tell Noreen that putting the toy back together could be simpler, allowing children to spend more time enjoying the toy than learning about it. Noreen allows them to make another prototype. After the second prototype is complete, the designers complain to Noreen that the toy is too simple to put together so that children do not learn enough when playing with it. One of the designers points out that the toy is supposed to be educational. Noreen calls the lead engineer into her office and asks if they knew that the toy was meant to be educational. The engineer was unaware. What leadership quality is missing?
Cultivate learning
Promote performance
Nurture collaboration
Correct answer
Build a vision
Overall explanation
Building a vision for a team ensures that the team has a common understanding of what they are working to achieve. A project manager is uniquely placed to provide this vision. Nurturing collaboration is appropriate for different skill sets but cannot reconcile different visions alone. Promoting performance is an incorrect choice because the teams are performing at least as well as expected and do not require additional instruction to do so. Cultivating learning happens when the project team learns through the team or from shadowing. In agile, experimenting and pair programming helps to foster learning.

Consider a project manager working in a predictive project with tight budgetary controls. Late in the project's life cycle, a stakeholder requests a data visualization layer to inform executive decisions. Since the requirement came very late, the project manager does not have any funds budgeted for training to complete this request. How should the project manager allocate resources for training?
Ask the team to work without pay.
Decrease the size of the team.
Correct answer
Asks the sponsor for additional funding.
Ask the stakeholder for additional funding.
Overall explanation
The sponsor is responsible for providing additional funding if the project goes over budget. They will have an ultimate say in whether the expense is justified. Decreasing the team's size on a mature project is risky and not practical for most projects. Cutting the team does not reduce the amount of work needed to be complete. Asking the project team to work without pay is unethical. Stakeholders differ from and overlap with sponsors in several ways, but sponsors have the final say when funding increases.

Team performance assessments are the tool needed to show the team how well it functions as a unit, what they are doing well, and what to work on moving forward. A project charter shows the team the overall goals of the project, which they should already know. Quality assurance is not the topic at hand, and performance reporting is generally more about the project in general.

You are the project manager of the HOF Project, which will replace 7,500 light fixtures on your organization's campus. The new fixtures will save money and are energy efficient. You gather the team for training on how the fixtures are to be installed so that every fixture will be installed the same way with the same results. As part of this training, you observe that it takes roughly thirty minutes for one fixture to be installed. You elect to use this parameter to predict that the project work will require 3,750 hours of labor to install all of the fixtures. Which one of the following best describes this cost estimate?
Correct answer
Flawed, as you have not accounted for the learning curve.
Accurate, as you are using a parametric estimate.
Flawed, as you have not accounted for Parkinson's Law.
Accurate, as you have proof of how long a fixture takes to install.
Overall explanation
The estimate is flawed, as you have not accounted for the learning curve. The learning curve tells us that over time, efficiency will increase with repetition. In other words, the workers are still learning the process of installing the fixture, but with practice, it will take them less time to install the fixture than it does right now. Using a parametric estimate in this scenario is true, but the estimate is flawed as the learning curve was not considered. There is initial proof of how long each fixture takes to install. You would need to take another duration measurement later in the project to see how long the work takes as efficiency increased. Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. So, if you give an hour to complete a task, the worker will take an hour to complete the task because that is how much time they have available to do it.

Rough order of magnitude estimate
Budget estimate
Correct answer
Definitive estimate
Three-point estimate
Overall explanation
The team should provide David with a definitive estimate. A definitive estimate is typically within +/-10 percent and is the most accurate estimate range. A rough order of magnitude is the least accurate estimate range. This choice is incorrect because a rough order of magnitude is usually estimated in the initiation stage and is not refined. The budget estimate is also not very refined. The budget estimate is usually around -10 to +25 percent and is a slightly more refined estimate from the rough order of magnitude.

Performing
Correct answer
Forming
Overall explanation
As defined by Tuckman's stages of team development, the forming stage is where the team acquaints and establishes ground rules. Formalities are preserved, and members are treated as strangers. In the storming stage, people start to push against the established boundaries. Conflict or friction can also arise between team members as their true characters and preferred ways of working surface and clash with other people. In the norming stage, people start to resolve their differences, appreciate one another's strengths, and respect the authority of their leader. Now that they know one another better, the team members will feel more comfortable asking for help and offering constructive feedback. They will share a stronger commitment to the team's goals, and they should make good progress toward it. In the performing stage, the team is in the flow and performing to its full potential.

Communication is a process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but it also recognizes the need to establish that the message has been understood. One additional step in an interactive communication model is to acknowledge. Upon the receipt of a message, the receiver may indicate acknowledgment of receipt of the message. However, acknowledgment does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been received.

Correct answer
Reach out to the legal team to determine if the review is necessary.
Alert the product owner of the risk.
Overall explanation
Willard should connect with the legal team to ensure the feature request is complying. Reprimanding whoever put in the request will not help ensure it is complying. The product owner is unlikely to be of any help. Rejecting the request is not optimal as it may be needed by Project N.

Frances is on a project team at the Comet Corporation. The project she is working on is currently halfway through a six-month implementation. This project is an application development project that is using a traditional waterfall approach. In a recent team meeting, the project manager praised another team member, Hal, for recent progress on a large task. Frances knows that Hal is uncomfortable with public praise. What should Frances do?
Privately speak to Hal about the project and how the project manager did not know Hal is shy.
Correct answer
Privately let the project manager know that Hal is uncomfortable with public praise.
Complain to the primary stakeholders about the project manager's lack of emotional intelligence.
Do nothing. Hal can speak up for himself.
Overall explanation
Individuals prefer praise in different ways, so letting the project manager know will help them properly manage the team while ensuring everyone is comfortable. The project manager likely did not know that Hal does not like public praise and did not intentionally try to embarrass the team member. Speaking only with Hal will not help the project manager choose the appropriate feedback method next time. Frances should not assume Hal will speak up for himself; while not gossiping, she should let the project manager know Hal is uncomfortable with the public praise. It is inappropriate for Frances to complain to the stakeholders about the project manager.

Rocky is a senior architect at your firm. You are consulting with Rocky because he was the original architect for a building that your project will renovate. Your project team is comprised of designers and building construction workers. What kind of stakes does Rocky have in this project?
Rights
Contribution
Ownership
Correct answer
Knowledge
Overall explanation
Rocky has knowledge stakes in this project. As the original architect of the building, he understands the building's composition. Rocky does not have ownership because he is not the owner of the building. Rocky does not have rights as a stake in this project. Rocky is not being asked to contribute to the renovation, so he does not have contribution stakes in this project.

Larry has been assigned as a cost engineer to build a car park near a major airport. The car park is installing an innovative new solar paneling system to conserve energy and reduce the local community's emissions cost. Larry has determined that the optimistic cost savings over one year would be $5,000,000 while a pessimistic total would be $1,000,000, with the most likely scenario being $3,500,000. Using triangular estimation, what would the cost estimation be in this scenario?
Correct answer
$3,166,666.67
$5,000,000.00
$3,500,000.00
$10,500,000.00
Overall explanation
Using triangular estimation, the answer, in this case, would be $3,166,666.67. Triangular estimation involves adding the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic costs of a project and dividing those values by 3. In this scenario, you would add (5,000,000 + 3,500,000 + 1,000,000) / 3 = $3,166,666.67. The other three values do not provide the answer to this problem.

Theresa has taken over a project that was six weeks into the timeline. The project was over budget and late when she took over as the project manager. Over the past five weeks, Theresa and her team have worked to recoup some of the project costs, bring the project closer to the original deadline and deliver the project with quality. Now Theresa needs to close the project, and she wants to ensure that she meets the project's exit criteria. Which of the following choices should she consult?
Correct answer
Project charter
Change log
Deliverables
Business case
Overall explanation
The project charter will contain information about the exit criteria for the project. While there may be enterprise environmental factors for closing the project, the charter should reference what is needed to close the project in the organization. The business case will not validate specific exit criteria, but it will validate that the business case was fulfilled. The change log will only validate that changes were resolved, not the project's acceptance criteria. While deliverables will inform that product requirements were met, they will not give information about meeting the project's exit criteria.

Robert is a project manager for a manufacturing project. Robert recently sat through a contentious meeting where the project team debated the best way to resolve a new problem discovered with critical equipment. While the debate was heated and required Robert to intervene, the team reached a consensus on its best path. All the team members shook hands and agreed this was the best path forward in the project. What should Robert do next?
Report the incident to the project management office.
Reprimand the team for having a heated debate and hurting team morale.
Correct answer
Praise the team for raising the issue, discussing options, and agreeing on a path forward.
Record the incident for future review.
Overall explanation
Despite the heated debate and a challenging situation, the team was still able to reach a consensus. This behavior should be encouraged. Reprimanding the team will discourage this positive behavior moving forward. Reporting this incident to the project management office will do nothing to help the team improve. Recording this incident will not reinforce this positive behavior in the future.

A project manager is deciding which water heater he will install in a project to build a series of condominiums. He jokes with a vendor that he could use a new water heater in his own house. The following morning he finds a brand new deluxe water heater, which the vendor he joked with happens to make, in his driveway. This can be seen as which one of the following?
A conflict of interest
A trial use of the water heater
Correct answer
A bribe
A coincidence
Overall explanation
This is a bribe from the vendor to the project manager. This is not a coincidence. It is very doubtful that the vendor wants the buyer to try the water heater in his house to decide. This is not a conflict of interest but a bribe.

Ricky, a project manager, has been negotiating with a vendor on the price of the resource his project needs. Ricky and the vendor are far apart on a settled price in the negotiations. In short, the vendor is offering a deal that gives Ricky the resource at a discounted rate but requires Ricky's organization to have a long-term contract. Ricky is willing to pay a bit more but wants to break the contract for the resource if the organization no longer needs the material. Neither side wants to budge. What should Ricky be seeking in this situation?
Correct answer
Ricky should seek an alternative.
He should stick to his proposed deal.
He should shop the deliverable to another client.
The customer is right, and the vendor should agree to their deal.
Overall explanation
Ricky should seek a different vendor that is able to meet their contract requirements. Not every negotiation works out, so it is not unreasonable to tell the vendor no. Ricky should not shop the deliverable to another client – Ricky is the client. If Ricky sticks to his proposed deal, there may never be an agreement and the project could be stalled. There comes a point in negotiations where it is apparent that you cannot move forward, so it is best to move on. The idea that the customer is always right is not always true. The vendor may seem unreasonable, but there may be other factors in his organization that are affecting his offer.

Bernie is the project manager of the Cadillac Project for his company, ILOVECARS.COM. The management at ILOVECARS.COM requires that Bernie only use the seven basic quality tools. Of the following responses, which is not one of the seven basic quality tools?
Correct answer
Network diagrams
Cause-and-effect diagram
Histogram
Control chart
Overall explanation
The correct answer is network diagrams because they are not part of the seven basic quality tools. The seven basic quality tools consist of the following: cause-and-effect diagrams, histograms, control charts, flowcharts, check sheets, Pareto diagrams, and scatter diagrams. A control chart is an incorrect response here because it is one of the seven basic quality tools. A histogram is part of the seven basic quality tools and is therefore incorrect. The cause-and-effect diagram is incorrect because it is one of the seven basic quality tools.

Louisa just joined a company as a project manager, and the company has put her to work on a contract which it recently won. This project will be with a new customer and includes a project team that has worked together on past efforts. Louisa's director, who has met with the company that provided the contract, suggests that a stakeholder analysis would help Louisa and her team prioritize input. The director has sent an email to the key stakeholders introducing Louisa as the project manager. Which part of a stakeholder analysis should Louisa complete first?
Classifying stakeholders
Correct answer
Identifying stakeholders
Contacting stakeholders
Assessment of stakeholder support
Overall explanation
The first step in stakeholder analysis is identifying stakeholders' roles, interests, influence, and expectations. Recording this information makes interviewing stakeholders more effective. This should be done before contacting stakeholders since some stakeholders may react in unexpected ways. Classifying stakeholders happen after the stakeholders have been identified and is usual for creating common stakeholder groups, such as scientists, programmers, and salespeople. Assessment of stakeholder support is a method to rank the forces for and against the project, which stakeholders will contribute to the project, and helps create a stakeholder engagement strategy. This activity happens after stakeholder identification. Contacting stakeholders has been accomplished by Louisa's organization already.

Question 177

You have just concluded a kick-off meeting with all key stakeholders and are ready to execute your project. However, your project team was not happy with some of the requirements you discussed at the meeting. It is apparent that team members are unhappy about the balance of the scope and the timeline set to complete the work. They do not believe it is enough time considering the amount of work. Nancy, a team member you have worked with in the past, stops you in the hallway and reports that some team members threaten to quit if the project moves forward. What should your next plan of action be?
Request to revert your plan to a command-and-control style of project management.
Correct answer
Meet with the team to discuss a realistic timeline to present to the stakeholders.
Ask the people who are threatening to quit what they would prefer to do on the project.
Crash the schedule to complete the objectives on time.
Overall explanation
Project managers are often caught in the middle of the project team and demands from stakeholders. Unrealistic timelines are a risk for project failure, so the project manager should work with the team to see what is realistic and present the proposed timeline to stakeholders. The stakeholder may be fixed on a deadline for various reasons, but there are solutions such as adding more team members, trimming the scope, or a phased delivery to create the most important items first. Requesting to revert your plan to a command-and-control style of project management is not a good solution to the project and may cause resentment among the team. Crashing the schedule to complete the objectives on time is a possibility as adding more labor can distribute the workload for the team. However, the best option presented is to first meet with the team to discuss what they think is a more realistic timeline for the presented project work. Asking the people who are threatening to quit what they would prefer to do on the project does not solve the issue with the stakeholders, so this is not a valid answer.

Part of your enterprise environmental factors, quality assurance, is a company-wide initiative, and every project must abide by the company's quality assurance initiatives. However, within your project, you also have quality assurance efforts and quality control efforts. Typically, what sort of process is quality control?
Correct answer
Inspection
Project manager
Audit
Management
Overall explanation
QC (quality control) requires an inspection of work results; inspection is the correct answer. Quality is planned into the project, and inspections make sure it exists. Management is incorrect because QA (quality assurance) is a managerial function, not QC. A project manager is an incorrect response; another team member, department, or SME may complete QC. An audit is too broad of an answer for this scenario and is therefore incorrect. Finances, schedules, or quality can drive audits.

Marissa is the project manager for a project that the company is designated as a mid-level priority. Her organization is utilizing a weak matrix. Marissa has a small project team in this current project, but the bulk of the work is done by those who have other primary jobs. It seems that some of the project team members are very busy between their day-to-day assignments in operations, other projects, and the work to do on Marissa's project. Marissa has also noticed clashes between the project team and those with the project as their secondary focus. Marissa hears complaints from all sides about who can do what and, more importantly, who can tell which person what to do. What should Marissa create, with the project team, to map out the assignments and accountability for each team member?
Gantt chart
Roles and Responsibility chart
Business case
Correct answer
RACI matrix
Overall explanation
A RACI matrix is the best choice as RACI means Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It is a matrix that maps out the assignments and accountability, a keyword in the question, for each specific team member. A Gantt chart is a type of flowchart that shows when activities are scheduled to happen on specific dates. Business cases do not map out specific assignments but show why the project has been initiated and focus on the business value the project will create. A roles and responsibility chart is not the best choice. This chart is also a matrix but does not show the accountability that a RACI matrix does. This type of matrix uses a simple checkmark to map the team member to the assignment rather than the depth of type of assignment involvement of each team member.

Carl, a new team member on the APPDEV Project, notices that the team defers to a senior developer on the team for questions about a specific technology in many meetings. When asked about this technology, the senior developer can deliver concise and accurate answers. Carl approaches his project manager and asks why the team defers to this individual for questions on that technology. The project manager explains that the senior developer has been working on the technology since it was launched and that he is a leader in the technology. The project manager also explains that sometimes the developer speaks at conferences on how to best work with the technology. How should the project manager address this question?
The project manager told the team to listen to the senior developer.
The senior developer demands the team listen to him because he is an expert.
The senior developer has been around the longest, so everyone should listen to them.
Correct answer
The senior developer is an expert in this domain, so the team should listen to their feedback.
Overall explanation
The senior developer is a recognized expert in this area and has expert power. Others defer to them in this domain due to their expert power. Tenure may impact an individual's influence, but this does not account for their expertise. A person can be around for a long time and not know much. A project manager may direct a team to listen to one individual, but they will lose credibility if the individual is not an expert and cannot offer good advice for the project work. The senior developer has not demonstrated any negative behavior around their knowledge.
