Management has come to you about the ground rules you and your team have created with an issue. Which one of the following statements about ground rules is false and should be modified?
Ground rules help increase team productivity.
Ground rules help increase team satisfaction.
Correct answer
The team's project manager provides ground rules.
Ground rules help to set expectations for team members.
Overall explanation
The team's project manager does not provide ground rules. The ground rules should be created and agreed upon by all team members. Ground rules help increase team productivity is a true statement about ground rules, so this choice is incorrect. Ground rules help increase team satisfaction is a true statement about ground rules, so this choice is incorrect. Ground rules help to set expectations of team members is a true statement about ground rules, so this choice is incorrect.

Question 2
Skipped
You are the project manager of an interior decorating project. Currently, the project plan calls for the painter to prime the walls for painting, wait four hours for the walls to cure, and then begin the painting process. However, due to humidity, the walls are taking four hours longer to cure than planned. The painting activities are on the critical path. Which one of the following is an acceptable solution for this problem with the least chance of changing the project end date?
Correct answer
Examine the network diagram to determine if the relationships between activities can be changed. If so, move the painting activities to later in the project.
Add lead time to the painting activity.
Change the relation of other activities so that the primer can cure faster.
Add lag time to the painting activity.
Overall explanation
Because the critical path cannot be expanded, the only logical choice is to attempt to move the activities to later in the project. The project team should focus on other activities while the primer cures. Lead time subtracts time from the scheduled start time of activities. Lag time will increase the time of the painting activities. Changing the relationship of activities will not help the primer cure faster.

Angie is the Tornado Corporation project manager for Project Reg, which is just entering its planning phase. Project Reg will require specialized equipment that was recently used on other projects at Tornado Corporation. Angie will not need to purchase the equipment, but she will need to have some maintenance performed on the equipment before using it in the project. During a planning meeting with the main stakeholders, Angie is asked to create a high-level budget for Project Reg. What information will Angie need to accomplish this?
Correct answer
A finalized scope statement and a rough outline of work.
Access to the specialized equipment needed for the project.
Detailed information on each task in the project.
Access to a commercial database of estimates of the equipment costs.
Overall explanation
Before Angie can provide an estimate on the cost of Project R, she will need to know its full scope and what it contains. At a high level, the project costs can be based on the project scope with an added range of variance, such as +/- 10 percent. Gathering detailed information on each task will be very time-consuming and provide a detailed budget, which is not what the stakeholders requested. A commercial database will not help Angie unless she understands the scope. Accessing the special equipment will not help Angie estimate for Project Reg.

Yulonda is working on collecting the requirements for a project as part of developing the scope management plan. She is debating on several data-gathering techniques to gather the information she needs to determine the customer requirements. Another project manager in the organization has completed over 20 projects related to Yulonda's, so she decides to consult lessons learned from those projects to build her project from them. Which data gathering technique best describes what Yulonda is employing in this scenario?
Brainstorming
Interviews
Questionnaires and surveys
Correct answer
Benchmarking
Overall explanation
Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices to comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. Brainstorming is performed in a group and lists ideas in a short amount of time. Interviews are a one-on-one communication tool where the interviewer asks prepared and spontaneous questions to an interviewee to acquire specific information. Questionnaires and surveys are a written set of questions to acquire information from many respondents quickly.

Lucas is the project manager for an agile project at Gaston Electric. He wants the team to communicate effectively. For an agile team, what is the preferred way of communicating?
Have mandatory conference calls
Leave a paper trail by using secure and saved e-mail
One-on-one phone conversations
Correct answer
Discussions face-to-face
Overall explanation
The recommended communication method for agile teams is face-to-face discussions. The other responses are incorrect. To avoid confusion and misinterpretation, agile recommends discussions face-to-face. If people can't meet in person, e-mail, conference calls, and one-on-one phone conversations may be used as an alternative.

Question 6
Skipped
Harold wants to ensure that his agile team works in a highly collaborative way. Whenever issues are discovered in their project, they discuss the roadblocks in the next daily standup with the entire team. The reason for this is:
Correct answer
The team owns the issue together collectively and participates in the solution together
So the scrum master is made aware of this issue and can solve it
Because roadblocks should always be resolved as part of daily standups
So the team knows how to resolve the roadblock for next time and can document the steps properly
Overall explanation
Roadblocks are discussed in daily standups so that the team can deal with the issue together outside of the meeting. Roadblocks are not resolved during daily standups. There is no documentation requirement. The scrum master should not be solving the issue that is the team’s responsibility.

Benjamin's project is to build a new bridge over a small creek. Government leaders want the bridge completed as soon as possible because of the economic impact the construction will have on the businesses in the community. However, an environmental group has concerns that the bridge will disrupt the natural and ecological factors surrounding the creek. The environmental group is demanding additional testing, surveys, and analysis before the project can continue. Which of the following choices best describes the environmental group in this instance?
Positive stakeholder (Stakeholder with positive interests)
Stakeholder
Correct answer
Negative stakeholder (Stakeholder with positive interests)
Risk owner
Overall explanation
The environmental group is a negative stakeholder because their concerns may impede the success and progress of Benjamin's project. A stakeholder is too vague a choice and is not the best answer. A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in the project's outcome and may be affected by the project work. A positive stakeholder wants the project to move forward as quickly as possible. A risk owner is a person who owns and is responsible for a project risk.

Belinda is working on collecting the requirements for a project as part of developing the scope management plan. She is debating on several data-gathering techniques that she can use to gather the information she needs to determine the customer requirements. Belinda has prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts who can aid her in the data gathering process. Which data gathering technique would be most beneficial for Belinda in this situation?
Questionnaires and surveys
Brainstorming
Interviews
Correct answer
Focus groups
Overall explanation
Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview. Brainstorming is performed in a group and lists ideas in a short amount of time. Interviews are a one-on-one communication tool where the interviewer asks prepared and spontaneous questions to an interviewee to acquire specific information. Questionnaires and surveys are written set of questions to acquire information from a large number of respondents quickly.

Jerry is responsible for taking notes on stakeholder requests for a new, eco-friendly line of toothbrushes. He compares the notes with the existing project charter and the scope, schedule, and budget management documents. He gives his professional opinion on how closely the latest suggestions align with the product's original outline. For instance, one of the stakeholders suggests using a rare plant fiber for the toothbrush bristles due to its hardiness and composability. While the latter two qualities are aligned with the product's original intentions, the rarity of the plant fibers makes the costs of each toothbrush prohibitive to middle-class customers. Jerry notes this in his report, which he emails to all of the stakeholders. Which process group is being integrated into the adaptive planning environment?
Correct answer
Planning process group
Monitoring and controlling process group
Executing process group
Initiating process group
Overall explanation
Planning processes are required to establish the project's scope, refine objectives, and define the course of action needed to accomplish the project's objectives. Initiating processes are performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project, including obtaining authorization to start or begin a phase. Executing processes are performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project requirements. Monitoring and controlling processes include tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project.

Question 10
Skipped
You are the project manager for your organization and it has been brought to your attention that some of the project team members are upset. The team members disagree with the senior network engineer about the installation of some equipment. You need to resolve this situation quickly before the project stalls any longer. Which of the following choices is an example of coercive power?
Correct answer
A project manager who will openly punish any team member who is late with an activity
A project manager who is friends with all of the project team members
A project manager who has lunch with the project team every Thursday
A project manager who has worked with the technology on the project for several years
Overall explanation
Coercive power is the formal authority a project manager wields over the project team; the project manager has the authority to discipline the project team members. Only referent power may come through lunch meetings. Experience in the technology or industry is expert power. Interpersonal relationships are examples of referent power.

Exploratory testing focuses on the discovery and relies on the individual tester’s guidance to uncover defects that are not easily covered in the scope of other tests like scripted tests, where the testers follow the script, which includes well-documented test cases and test steps. At the end of each sprint, in which event do the scrum teams demonstrate the working software to the customer?
Product demo
Sprint retrospective
Correct answer
Sprint review
Sprint demo
Overall explanation
The sprint review is the team’s main opportunity to demonstrate working software at the end of each sprint. All the project stakeholders attend the sprint demo and provide feedback on the software. That feedback is incorporated back into the product backlog, which the team uses to plan future sprints. The sprint retrospective is a lesson learned meeting to review the project’s success and failures. A product demo is not a valid ceremony in the sprint, but it is analogous to the sprint review.

John is the project manager of a predictive project for his organization. This project will replace the outdoor lighting on the organization’s campus with a new lighting design. The design provides for better light pollution and illumination around the property and long-term financial savings. John's project has a schedule variance of $63,000. The planned value (PV) for his project at the six-month milestone is $100,000. The project has a CPI of 0.7. What is the Earned Value (EV) of John's project so far?
$36,000 savings
$70,000
$44,100
Correct answer
$163,000
Overall explanation
The Earned Value (EV) can be calculated by adding the schedule variance and planned Value (PV), yielding $163,000. Schedule variance is found by using the formula of Earned Value – Planned Value. In this case, earned value is $163,000, and the planned value is $100,000, for a defined schedule variance of $63,000. So, if we manipulate the formula, schedule variance + planned value = earned value. All of the other answer choices are incorrect for this question.

The project manager needs to identify the organizational structure in which she is operating to better plan the project. Which organizational structure provides the least amount of power for the project manager and more for the functional managers?
Strong matrix
Weak matrix
Projectized
Correct answer
Functional
Overall explanation
The functional structure provides the least amount of authority for the project manager. The weak matrix provides more power than the functional structure, but it still limits the project manager's authority. The strong matrix provides the project manager more power than the functional manager. The projectized structure provides the most power for the project manager.

You have recently been hired to lead a software development project. While you were expecting some time to ramp up on the project, meet the stakeholders, and learn more about the organization you are now working for, your manager has asked you to start immediately on the new project. You have met a few of your team members but do not know where to start communicating. You have read the project charter and have discussed the roles of the project with your manager. What should you do next in this scenario?
Create a stakeholder management plan
Create a team role and responsibilities matrix
Correct answer
Create a stakeholder register
Create a stakeholder analysis grid
Overall explanation
Of all choices presented, the stakeholder register is the best option as this document lists all the stakeholders and will help you know who you will need to communicate with in the project. A stakeholder management plan is not a valid document – as you will need a stakeholder engagement plan. This is a good choice, but not the best choice as you have only met a few of your team members. A stakeholder register will document all stakeholders, including your project team. A stakeholder analysis grid cannot be created until you first identify all the stakeholders in the project.

Anya is the scrum master for Project Jot, which is in its seventh iteration. During the past three iterations, the number of story points the team has completed has been 27, 29, and now 25. Anya has asked the team to complete 35 story points in this iteration to keep the project moving and regain velocity. Is this possible?
Correct answer
Yes, but assigning a specific number of points is not a good idea.
No, the most recent iteration was only 29 points.
Yes, the project team has demonstrated it can complete more than 29 story points.
No, the average velocity is only 27 points.
Overall explanation
Since the team determines the story point value of a task, assigning a target exposes Anya to the team "gaming" their numbers (e.g., inflating smaller tasks). The development team should not aim for artificial velocity or be forced to try to rush more work through their process. Steady and uniform work is ideal. The fact that the team has completed more story points in the past does not guarantee they will do it again in the future. The recent velocity does not necessarily relate to the next iteration. It is possible smaller tasks may have been added, or a team member may have been sick. While the average velocity is 27 points, it is possible for the team to complete more story points. However, this is not a good idea as the team could "game" the value of story points to achieve the metric, but they could still deliver the same amount of work.

Question 16
Skipped
As a scrum master, you guide your team through educational software development and work closely with your product owner to understand the business value associated with the product features and their priority. Knowing the importance of delivering the highest value features first, your team focuses on top priority items from the product backlog. Which agile principle is being practiced by your team?
Technical excellence and good design are achieved through agility and continuous attention to detail.
Correct answer
Simplicity—the art of maximizing work not done is essential.
Employees on the company's business side must work together with the development team daily and throughout the project.
The team reflects on work completed at regular intervals and makes adjustments as needed.
Overall explanation
Simplicity, the art of maximizing work not done is essential, is the correct answer. As products develop incrementally, the backlog items may be eliminated or no longer required by the users as the final product comes to form; thus, delivering the highest priority item is essential to minimizing the effort toward an acceptable product. This statement is true, but does not define the answer completely. Simply communicating with others does not get the project work done. This is a true statement, but it does not answer the question as fully as the agile concept of maximizing work not done. This is a true statement, but it misses the point of keeping things simple in the project work.

Olivia has spent the last week refining and researching several proposed changes to her project; a social media web application focused on sharing books. To help stakeholders make informed decisions, she creates a report detailing each possible change and describing how the changes could affect the project. For instance, adding a GPS component to the project will likely cost several thousand dollars in fees and require hiring a developer familiar with similar implementations. Olivia plans to give the stakeholders an overview of the report and incorporate any changes that they approve. Which part of the change management process does this represent?
Correct answer
Present a change request to change the control board.
Impact analysis of change request.
Implement approved changes.
Identify a new change request.
Overall explanation
Presenting change requests to the change control board is the path to getting change requests approved (or rejected). Identifying new change requests is precisely what it sounds like: recognizing a request as constituting a change from the previously decided framework. Impact analysis identifies how a change request affects other tasks or phases of the project. Implementing approved changes is the final step in the change request process, at which point the change requests are fully incorporated into the project plan.

As an experienced project manager in a high-tech firm, you oversee a lucrative project which spans over a few years. The market conditions force the organization to abandon this project, leaving you with an unfinished product halfway through the expected timeline. To capture the extent of work completed up to the termination date, you document the tangible goods delivered. This process is part of the
Correct answer
Validate scope
Define scope
Control scope
Create a WBS for the completed work
Overall explanation
Since the project has come to a stop, sudden or expected, you must measure the scope and compare it to the scope baseline. The output of validate scope is the acceptance of any deliverables, even if the project has been canceled. Control scope is monitoring the project status and managing changes to the project baseline. Define scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the product or service. Creating a WBS for the completed work is not needed. The WBS is part of project planning, and this project is now being closed.

You are the project manager for your organization and you have a large team. Your project is a high-profile project with a strict deadline and little room for quality errors. Your team is in the 'Storming' phase according to Tuckman's stages of team development. Two of your teammates are getting into an argument about what feature they should focus on for a mobile application for the next iteration. As much as you would like to express your opinions about the matter, you feel you have little knowledge about software development and thus say nothing to stop the argument. Which of Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a team best describes the scenario above?
Lack of commitment
Fear of conflict
Correct answer
Absence of trust
Avoidance of accountability
Overall explanation
This is an absence of trust issue on several fronts. The two team members likely do not trust each other enough to listen and consider each other's points of view. The project manager is not trusting their experience and ability to coach the team members to work together. While agile projects do want teams to be self-led and self-organizing, it is appropriate for the leader to get involved and coach the team members to an agreeable solution when conflicts are preventing progress. This is not a fear of conflict scenario as the team members are in conflict already. Lack of commitment is not the best choice as both team members are committed to the project and to their decision for the project to move forward. Avoidance of accountability is not represented in this scenario, so this is not the best choice.

A system development project had some problems that now seem under control. Angie joins as a replacement for the previous project manager, who had to leave due to a family emergency. Angie believes that the rest of the project work is relatively straightforward and decides not to spend a long time on risk identification. However, while she prepares the risk responses, she realizes that when a risk response is proposed, another risk is determined that is caused by the response. What is the best course of action for Angie to take?
Make sure the remaining project work is better understood.
Clearly define the risk responses, using more time out of the schedule to do so, if necessary.
It appears that risks have been missed. Therefore, Angie should get more people involved in the identify risks process.
Correct answer
Document any newly identified risks and continue with the plan risk responses process.
Overall explanation
This question describes secondary risks, and identifying secondary risks is an intricate part of completing the risk response planning process. The best choice in this situation is to document the newly identified risks and continue with the plan risk responses process. Secondary risks may only happen if the preceding risk event and risk response happens. Not all risks, including secondary risks, will occur. More people are not necessarily needed to identify risks in the project. Risk responses could cause new secondary risks to happen in the project, and there is no evidence that more people are needed to identify risk events. The remaining project work is not the concern in this scenario; it is the secondary risk response and what should happen next in the risk planning activities. All risk responses should be documented in the risk register. This does not necessarily require more project time to do, so this choice is incorrect.

Bill's agile team leader at Gaston Engineering has decided to track defect cycle time. Of the choices below, which best describes what is being tracked?
Which developer created the defects during a cycle time.
During a cycle time, the number of defects discovered.
The inaccuracy of the cycle time estimate.
Correct answer
From the introduction to completion, the amount of time it took to fix a defect.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is from beginning to end, the amount of time it takes to fix a defect once it has been reported. Cycle time, or an iteration, is directly affected by the length of defect cycle time. While an estimate's accuracy is tracked, it is not part of the defect cycle time's amount. Who is creating the defects is not part of defect cycle time. Defect cycle time is concerned with how long it takes to fix a defect, not how many defects were found.

Peter stepped in midway to a long-term project that is using a hybrid of agile methods. The team is using a product backlog, and they are efficient at their work. They are releasing working software in increments, but Peter notices a disparity between the project's original vision and what's being produced. The project team does not seem to notice this. They view the fact that they are moving through the backlog quickly as a huge success. Peter needs to bring back the project's original mission and vision to the team quickly as it is getting away from him. What can Peter show the project team to reestablish the original vision?
Schedule baseline
Correct answer
Project charter

Quality management plan
Product backlog
Overall explanation
Peter needs to get this project team back to basics, and the best start is to review the project charter. The project charter will give the team a high-level overview of the project and allow Peter to make the case that the team needs to refocus on the original vision. Showing the team the product backlog would not be efficient as they would view it as evidence that they are on the right track. The quality management plan addresses quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. It would not be applicable to the team in this scenario. The product charter is not part of a project management approach. The project charter is specific to the project the team is working on. The schedule baseline shows the planned timeline for events like milestones and phase gates. This would not be beneficial for the team in this scenario.

The results of the assessment show that there is little communication between the general managers of every store. Each manager runs their store differently, and there is no standard upheld between any one store. Additionally, employees at these stores receive weekly training on topics they feel are not relevant to improving the business. There is a high turnover rate at the lowest levels of the organization. Which of the following type of organization BEST describes the organization shown above?

Overall explanation
The organization is best described as Seat of the pants project management – High Competency and Low Capability, describes a purely reactionary organization. Their members function in the "Just get it done" mantra. Every manager can be described as "white knights" who have their processes but no standards. Additionally, attrition and burnout can be seen from the high turnover rates. The blind leading the blind - Low Competency and Capability. When individuals and organizations are weak in their efforts, they may have the passion but not the executive team's direction. Working towards best in class – High Competency and Capability describes a coordinated effort of individuals possessing strong skills and a supportive organization that yields an oath that drives towards continuous improvement and monitored change.

You have been concerned that a deliverable will not be complete by the set deadline. As you begin to discuss what could have happened to delay the product completion with the team members, you find out that the factory used a dye that the client did not approve. Your team assures you that the documentation is in place that details what is expected by the client. After meeting with the stakeholder responsible for communication with the client, you find out the client changed the deliverable's desired color, and the team was not informed. The customer does indeed want the dye color and does not feel this will affect the project end date. After identifying through root cause analysis what happened, you realize that a form was not submitted. What is the form that is missing?
Correct answer
Change request
Work performance report
Defective repair form
Project plan form
Overall explanation
A change request is a form that is submitted to adjust, expand, and reduce product scope per the quality requirements that have previously been set. Change requests impact the product deliverables, project documentation, and the project management plan. A defective repair form is not the best choice as this is not a defect but a change that has been approved but circumvented the project's change control process. A work performance report defines how well the task(s) was/were completed and does not address change requests. A project plan form is not a valid project management term you will see on your exam.

Correct answer
Refer them to the change control process for Project X.
Assign a team member to analyze the tasks.
Tell them they will need to find an additional budget.
Refer them to the steering committee.
Overall explanation
Ethan should direct the stakeholders to Project X's change control process. This will allow them to submit the changes in a controlled manner. The steering committee is not likely able to assist because they provide high-level oversight of the project. Finding additional funds is not ideal as the changes have not yet been approved.

Joe explains the difference between an agile project charter and a non-agile project charter to his brother, Jeff. Which of the following choices is the most likely explanation Jeff would give?
A stable project plan is detailed in an agile charter; A high-level project plan is outlined in a non-agile charter.
Team members are explicitly named in an agile charter; non-agile charters define teams.
The definitive project outcome is defined in an agile charter; the non-agile charter defines the desired outcome.
Correct answer
High-level goals are set in an agile charter; non-agile charters are highly detailed.
Overall explanation
Agile and non-agile projects both have the same goal, but an agile project charter has less detail than a non-agile one. Agile methodology is good for projects involving technology, uncertain requirements, and outcomes that cannot be defined. As the project progresses, the agile charter, a living document, is subject to change. The other statements are incorrect statements regarding agile project charters and are therefore incorrect responses.

Phil is a project manager for his organization. He has been working on a large implementation project for the last two years. There have been multiple turnovers on his teams, and he is struggling to maintain a grasp on the knowledge and manage the transfer of knowledge between team members. How should Phil increase the communication in his teams and manage knowledge more efficiently?
Use a spreadsheet to manage all the updates and share the spreadsheet to be updated as needed.
Build a social media site specifically dedicated to the project and invite all team members to participate and share knowledge on the new project site.
Correct answer
Set up a Project Management Information System (PMIS) and build a document repository that provides a chronological update of documents and project plans in a central location.
Set up a group email where all team members have access to the daily updates, old news, and messages to allow them to acquire the knowledge.
Overall explanation
A PMIS is invaluable when managing knowledge transfer in a project. While you can use group emails and social media sites, the best approach is to have a dedicated PMIS where everyone can effectively collaborate on tasks and share information between teams. A group email would not include quick access to past information. Emails can be messy to keep organized and include documents for reference. A social media site could work for the current shared information, but it is not as comprehensive as using a central location for current and past information like a PMIS. A spreadsheet is not as dynamic and easily maintained as a centralized PMIS.

Correct answer
A “cave”, or small private office

Overall explanation
Common or team areas can be very distracting sometimes. Private offices or “caves” are often included in an agile team’s space so that private conversations, phone calls, or just a few moments of quiet for a team member can occur.

Politics and power structures constitute a hierarchy of authority within and beyond an organization. A project manager will need to consider their stakeholder's position in this hierarchy to move the project forward. Environment and culture entail the way things are commonly done in an organization. Although related to politics and power structures, these practices have less to do with hierarchy and more to do with transactions at large. Analytics and assessment techniques are important for letting stakeholders apply their metrics for success to project outcomes. Communication means and strategies are the plans and intentions of communication from the project to the stakeholder. This answer also defines the frequency that stakeholders prefer to interact with the project manager.

You are managing a project to create a compact drone for a search and rescue company. Robert, one of the project team members, comes to you to report an issue. After inspecting the parts created by a manufacturer, he notes that some components have not been carried out according to the design plan. If these issues are not fixed before mass production, the project might be at significant risk of failure. To analyze the situation, Robert has identified the corrective action with the manufacturer. Only a minor adjustment is needed to the faulty part to achieve quality. The correction will cost the project $7,500 and one week of production time, but the manufacturer ensures quality. Of the following choices given, which step should you take first?
Consult the project sponsor.
Correct answer
Submit a change request.
Implement the corrective actions.
Coach the team member responsible for the manufacturing process.
Overall explanation
Submitting a change request (CR) is your next step after corrective actions have been identified. Consulting the project sponsor is not the best choice as the project manager needs to follow the change control process. All changes are documented first. Implementing the corrective actions without creating the change request bypasses integrated change control and the defined process for all change management. The individuals responsible for the manufacturing process may not directly report to the project manager. Therefore coaching cannot be performed and is not the best answer to this question.

Steven is the product owner for the development of a user-friendly grocery shopping website for older adults. This website is designed to allow its end-users to select groceries through an online inventory and have them delivered directly to their residence. Steven wants to create a vision statement posted in the development room, so his team can refer to it when writing their user stories. Which of the following is not a component of a vision statement?
Product benefit or reason to buy
Product category
Correct answer
Methodology to be used for product development
Competitors
Overall explanation
The methodology used for the development of the website is not a component of the vision statement. The vision statement describes the product, the value the project creates, and positively explains why the project has been initiated. While establishing the method is vital for the development team, it does not relate to the end-users needs. Product category is typically part of the vision statement as it clearly defines what the project will create. Product benefit or reason to buy is useful as it shows the value the project will create. Identified competitors are often part of the vision statement to compare and contrast, set goals, and inspire the project team.

Nayeem is the project manager of the Guthrie Project, which consists of 26 stakeholders and requires implementation activities in the United States and Canada. Management has asked Nayeem to give a duration estimate for the project. Which of the following responses will offer the highest level of detail in Nayeem's estimate?
An order of magnitude
A stakeholder analysis
Correct answer
The resource calendar
A requirements document
Overall explanation
The resource calendar is the correct and best answer here because it is the only choice that is an activity duration estimating input. Stakeholder analysis is incorrect because it does not accurately forecast when the project will end. A requirements document is a tempting choice but is incorrect because it is defined as a list of high-level deliverables, while the WBS is more detailed. For an accurate estimate, an order of magnitude provides minimal information and is an incorrect response.

Tanya needs to create it
Executive management
Correct answer
Her program management office
The project management information system
Overall explanation
Tanya should check with her program management office to get guidance on what governance processes are necessary at RollIUp Corporation. The project management information system is a software solution, not a resource for compliance information, so this choice is incorrect. Executive management is not likely to have the answers that Tanya needs. The project management office is the best choice presented. Tanya will not create the compliance requirements. Compliance requirements typically come from government agencies and are considered external requirements.

As the project manager for the Petoskey Project, Hugo would like to meet with a stakeholder for scope validation. Of the following responses, which is typical of scope validation?
An up-to-date review on the project team's performance
A review of project scope changes with the stakeholders
Correct answer
A performance review of the project deliverables
A review of the project's EVM results to date
Overall explanation
The correct answer is a performance review of the project deliverables. In the area of scope validation, the customer is concerned with the product's performance. An up-to-date review of the project team's performance is incorrect because it is not relevant to scope validation. A review of the project's EVM results to date is incorrect because they are not relevant to scope validation. A review of project scope changes with stakeholders may seem correct, but it is not because the stakeholder should already be aware of the changes before scope validation occurs.

Janet's team is new to the agile approach at Baelish Bail Bonds. The best first step for her to take with her stakeholder team is:
To discuss their availability for their first cycle to properly calculate capacity.
To ensure they all create a communications planning document together.
Correct answer
To explain agile basics so they understand what it is about and what they should expect.
A detailed project charter.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to explain agile basics to the team so they know what to expect. Since agile charters are different than traditional, the team would be confused if this was presented first. Capacity is also not the first thing to discuss since several steps occur before an iteration is planned. There is no agile requirement for a communications planning document, nor the requirement to create one together.

Shelby is a project manager, and she uses a hybrid approach to her projects. The upfront project planning is predictive, and the remainder of the project execution is agile. Shelby's team uses story points to estimate the level of effort for different tasks related to her team's projects.  After several months of working together, her teams are reasonably accurate when assessing how much work a given task will require. During a four-week sprint, each of Shelby's teams will complete around forty story points and still have time to work on other projects. An emergency project has been launched for Shelby and her team, and the organization needs the project finished quickly, or they will have fines and penalties for missing government compliance. What can Shelby do in this scenario with her team and the emergency project?
Stop all projects and focus on just this one project
Correct answer
Maximize velocity for this emergency project
Implement acceptance test-driven development
Prioritize backlog grooming for this emergency project
Overall explanation
Increasing velocity simply means performing more work as a team in the same amount of time or less. The team will likely need to reduce velocity on other assignments by maximizing velocity for the emergency project. This is an unusual cause and disruption, but the emergency project calls for the interruption and delay in other work. Stopping all projects is not the best choice as we do not know if all the other projects have any resources that the current project needs. Acceptance of test-driven development brings teams of developers, analysts, and stakeholders together to determine successful products and project thresholds. Backlog grooming is performed by the product owner and ensures that the most important items are prioritized in the product backlog.

After meeting with the analyst, Juan recognizes that his project is about to go over budget. After meeting with the engineer, he learns that an automation project is several months behind. When he meets with the foreman, he learns that employees are excited by a holiday bonus prospect. Juan immediately realizes that additional work will be required over the holidays and that bonuses will likely be decreased or eliminated. What servant leadership principle should he use?
Behaving well
Correct answer
Transparency
Assistance with life issues
Honoring opinions
Overall explanation
Transparency is an appropriate servant leadership principle whenever possible, especially when reasonable expectations are at odds with likely outcomes. Transparency makes efficient use of information and allows teams to plan. Assistance with life issues can be helpful if employees have individual concerns. Honoring opinions helps to embody servant leadership and build trust on a team but typically does not apply to structural issues that affect large parts of the organization. Behaving well is not a valid choice for this question. Behaving well is the assumption that we act as professionals within the work guidelines of the organization and apply good emotional intelligence.

Cancel all current projects and start new ones.
Include language to the project charter and other project documents that reflect the company culture.
Change nothing because, as a successful PM, Art can do what he wants.
Correct answer
Vet all incoming projects to ensure that they meet the company vision and values.
Overall explanation
As a loyal employee who appreciates a clear vision, Art should use the CEO's new mission, value, and strategic vision to vet incoming projects. He should make sure that the prospective project matches the vision. He should not cancel current projects unless they are in direct violation of the new vision, which isn’t something that a project manager would usually have the authority to do on their own. Art should also weave the new language of the organization’s vision into the project charter and other project documents, but not necessarily the organization’s culture.

Recently Bradley heard that one of the developers in his team obtained a new certification by studying after working hours. What is the best thing Bradley should do with this information next?
Correct answer
Congratulate the developer at the next team meeting.
Make the developer teach the team what he has learned.

Overall explanation
Bradley should publicly congratulate the developer on his accomplishment. This will both help improve team morale and reinforce the need for continual development of the team. Assigning more challenging tasks is a good idea but not the best next step. Doing nothing may make team members think that team self-development is not rewarded or recognized.

Project Step was canceled, the team disbanded, and the project manager was fired. The project has been idle for three months when the steering committee selects Paul to take on the controversial project. The steering committee has asked him to put together a project team for Project Step. What information will be most beneficial to help Paul accomplish this?
A previous budget from the past work
Correct answer
A project scope statement
A list of available resources from the past project
A mind map
Overall explanation
The project's scope statement will best help Paul identify resource requirements for Project Step. This will also help Paul get insight into the project before it was canceled. The project scope is the results generated by the project and will tell Paul what skills his project team members require. The list of resources needed from the past project might have some insight, but not as helpful as using the project scope statement. The project budget would also be insightful, but the project scope is the best document to review first. A mind map is a requirements gathering tool and is not the best choice for this scenario.

Notify the stakeholders of the problem
Notify management of the problem
If the delay is less than ten days, say nothing
Correct answer
Give management a proposed solution
Overall explanation
The correct response is to give management a proposed solution to the problem. Problems will inevitably happen throughout a project, so the project manager must be prepared with a possible solution to present to the appropriate stakeholders. Ignoring the problem by saying nothing could potentially cause more project issues. All stakeholders may not need to know about a problem, and it is not ideal to simply notify them without a proposed fix. Reporting the problem only to management is not the best choice here.

Felicia is the scrum master for Project Halo, which is ten iterations into its deployment and is $25,000 over budget. Recently the project team determined that a large story had to be broken down into smaller pieces. What should Felicia do about this?
Bring in contractors to help with the work to get the story done.
Do nothing. The new pieces will automatically appear in the next iteration.
Correct answer
Work with the product owner and team to slice the story.
Have the team work overtime as needed to complete the large story.
Overall explanation
Felicia should work with the product owner and the development team to slice the story for future iterations. Often, large user stories need to be broken down even more, but sometimes they cannot be due to the nature of the work or deliverable. Large user stories like this can be sliced into multiple sprints to get the story completed. It is likely not necessary to bring in contractors to complete the story for the team, as the team can do the work but cannot complete the whole story in one iteration. Working overtime is not a good practice. Instead, steady, consistent velocity is what is needed. Doing nothing is rarely a good practice; the story is too large to fit into one sprint, so the team needs to address the issue, not ignore it.

They have passed that phase, and now they feel like comfortable parts of the team that have no issues with dissenting opinions. They trust their neighbors on the team, but still have some issues communicating about the work progress. Ricardo is pleased that they got here, but he feels like they have been stuck here for two years. In what phase does the team seem to be stuck?
Correct answer
Norming
Forming
Performing
Storming
Overall explanation
This team seems to have passed the forming and storming phases pretty quickly. They are stuck in the norming phase. While this is an excellent place to attain their final destination, they should be performing. A norming team is doing well for itself and may have few conflicts, but the team clicks in the performing phase. The team has not yet reached the performing stage as they seem stuck and not relying totally upon each other. A performing team operates out of trust, autonomy, and job titles are less important. The team has passed the storming phase as they have argued and had some rebellion towards project authority. The team has been established for a long time, so forming is not a valid answer. Forming is the first stage of team development.

Abigail is the project manager for the Daisy Corporation and manages a big project that requires many materials and spans the better part of two years. During planning, she negotiates a contract with a vendor to provide construction services to the project. What details are likely included in the contract?
Correct answer
The contract will include a clause to cover economic cost adjustments.
The contract will include a way to recover costs if the vendor goes out of business.
The contract will include an award fee.
The project management office must sign the contract.
Overall explanation
Given the length of this project and its materials requirements, the contract is likely to cover an economic cost adjustments clause. This will ensure the vendor is fairly reimbursed for the actual cost of materials when there is fluctuation in the marketplace. The economic cost adjustments contract is used on longer contracts. It requires the organization to share the risk of the fluctuation in raw materials the vendor may need to purchase for the contracted work. The contract is unlikely to include a clause for recovering costs if the vendor goes out of business. The contract is unlikely to include an award fee. The project management office's signature being a requirement is not the best choice.

Closely monitor the materials used by the vendor.
Ensure the vendor has sufficient ramp-up time.
Instruct the vendor only to purchase materials from one provider.
Correct answer
Clearly defined phases tied to the incentives.
Overall explanation
Clearly defining phases and how the incentive fee is tied to those phases will help Brenda set clear expectations and control costs with this vendor. Ramp-up time will not impact the fees for this contract. While Brenda should be aware of the materials used, they will likely not be the most significant expense for this contract. Generally, the project manager will not be able to dictate where the vendor's materials are sourced.

Theodore is a project manager for Project WNS, which uses a balanced matrix approach. The project is five months into a seven-month implementation and is currently $20,000 over budget. The project is on track to complete on time, but some quality issues have caused rework and wasted materials. During a recent project review meeting, Theodore notices that one specific team member's performance has declined significantly in the project. Theodore thinks the team member is overworked as he is on multiple projects. What should the project manager do next?
Privately coach the team member.
Discuss this with the team member's manager and have them correct the problem.
Correct answer
Strategize on the best approach with that team member's manager.
Call out the team member publicly in the next team meeting for their poor performance.
Overall explanation
As this project uses a balanced matrix approach, the functional manager should stay involved in performance assessments and adjustments. They will also provide another perspective on how to provide feedback to this individual best. Calling the individual out publicly will have a negative impact on team morale and will not help improve performance. The functional manager should be involved. However, since this is a balanced matrix project, Theodore should also help with a solution. Privately coaching the team member may help improve performance but may not be the best solution.

You have recently interviewed Jason and Nancy in the organization. Nancy is a senior project manager and you asked to evaluate Jason, another project manager, on team cohesiveness. Upon evaluation, it was determined that Jason does not do any team cohesiveness exercises with his team. Why are these exercises helpful?
Correct answer
Team cohesiveness improves project performance.
Team cohesiveness exercises allow project managers to assign tasks to the strongest team members.
Team cohesiveness exercises determine who the strongest leader in the group is.
Team cohesiveness exercises allow individuals to perform assignments more effectively.
Overall explanation
Increased team cohesiveness, where team members share information and experiences openly and help each other improve, while not the most important activity on a project, do improve the overall project performance. Team cohesiveness exercises are not used to determine who the strongest leader is. Team cohesiveness exercises are not used to create assignments for team members.

The halo effect is the assumption that because the person is good at a technology, he would also be good at managing a project dealing with that said technology.

Impact analysis identifies how a change request affects other tasks or phases of the project. Identifying new change requests is precisely what it sounds like: recognizing a request as constituting a change from the previously decided framework. Presenting change requests to the change control board is the path to getting change requests approved (or rejected). Implementing approved changes is the final step in the change request process, at which point the change requests are fully incorporated into the project plan.

Overall explanation
A principled approach with objectivity in mind is the best strategy. Ralph can logically respond and counter during negotiations by separating the emotions to find the best alternative to the negotiated agreement. Soft bargaining with a client like this will most likely embolden the client to be even more aggressive. While Ralph could enlist help, he should not leave negotiations to someone else.

Backlog grooming
Acceptance test-driven development
Continuous integration

Testing at all levels forces teams to consider how some parts of a project or product interact with others to decrease errors and issues. Testing all tests at every touchpoint and utilization of the project quality and execution to capture any bottleneck, breakdown in the process, or other issues. Continuous integration allows and encourages teams to complete and implement smaller parts of a larger project.

Things happen quickly at Chris's company, which has a culture characterized by rapid-fire updates to existing projects. As a result, work that was planned, performed, and incorporated into the minimum viable product can become redundant. Several stakeholders have complained to Chris when this happens, and they have insisted that it is part of his job to be aware of current events and course correct when possible. Chris understands their frustration but knows that he cannot be everywhere at once. He asks the stakeholders if they would be willing to work with him to prevent similar future issues and try an agile approach to a project. How can the project manager deliver business value and remove frustrations for the development team in this scenario?
Continuous integration
Testing at all levels
Acceptance test-driven development
Correct answer
Backlog grooming
Overall explanation
When utilizing an agile approach to the project, changes are welcome, but they are entered into a product backlog by the product owner. Backlog grooming prioritizes changes in the backlog rather than being immediately given to the team for creation. This allows the team an iteration to work on a known set of requirements and not worry about what changes stakeholders may be dreaming up for them. Continuous integration allows and encourages teams to complete and implement smaller parts of a larger project. Testing at all levels forces teams to consider how some parts of a project or product interact with others to decrease errors and issues. Acceptance of test-driven development brings teams of developers, analysts, and stakeholders together to determine successful products and project thresholds.

Guy is a scrum master at Rainy Day Corporation. He is planning a new project that has a budget of $725,000. This project will affect the entire organization and there is much concern about the project's ability to meet the scope, budget, and schedule. During a recent stakeholder meeting, the question of how project governance will be handled was brought up. What is Guy's most likely response?
Correct answer
Follow the enterprise environmental factors for governance.
Copy the structure used by other, similar projects.
Have the project team determine the governance structure.
Let the stakeholders figure it out.
Overall explanation
The enterprise environmental factors of the organizations are going to determine the governance of the project. Project governance describes the rules and formality of the project. Copying a governance structure from another project is not ideal as this project may have unique, specific needs. In some organizations, the bigger the project, the more formal the governance. Letting the stakeholders determine the structure is not ideal as they may settle on a suboptimal solution – or not care about the approach. The project team should not determine project governance unless the organization has no governance, customs, or culture that direct the governance. In these scenarios, the project manager and the team should establish the framework and rules for the project to follow.

All of the project stakeholders recently attended a meeting facilitated by Elly. During the meeting, Elly took the stakeholders through the potential risks of adjusting the size of the ball bearings in their product. After reviewing Elly's findings, the stakeholders agree that the change needs to happen. They sign off on Elly's finalized changelog, and Elly informs them that she will start working to make the change immediately. What should Elly do next?
Impact analysis of change request.
Identify a new change request.
Correct answer
Implement approved changes.
Present a change request to change the control board.
Overall explanation
Implementing approved changes is the final step in the change request process, at which point the change requests are fully incorporated into the project plan. Identifying new change requests is precisely what it sounds like: recognizing a request as constituting a change from the previously decided framework. Impact analysis identifies how a change request affects other tasks or phases of the project. Presenting change requests to the change control board is the path to getting change requests approved (or rejected).

You are part of a self-organizing, collocated team of generalizing specialists working to deliver results incrementally. Which mode of communication is of most value in this environment?
Virtual and accurate task boards.
Scheduled, formal notes and status reports.
Correct answer
Face-to-face and informal.
Self-organizing teams do not rely on communication.
Overall explanation
The key here is to identify the project team as one that is agile. Face-to-face interactions are the most critical mode of communication and are regarded as the best way to convey information. The other choices are not valid choices for an agile team.

After transitioning to an entirely virtual environment, a project manager notices that one of their employees is disengaging from the project. The quality of their work has been decreasing, deadlines are occasionally missed, and the project manager strongly suspects that the employee is no longer reading their email. Co-workers report that they have tried to engage the employee using an instant messaging application, but the employee only responds sporadically. Which alternative should the project manager explore for virtual team member engagement?
Email/chat
A shared portal
Video conferencing
Correct answer
Audio conferencing
Overall explanation
Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication, and it is appropriate for sharing nuances that are not necessarily included in written communication. It can be useful to make employees feel like they are part of a team even when they have no in-person interactions with teammates. A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. However, such repositories are mainly useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Video conferencing is a critical technique for virtual teams. However, it is most helpful to demonstrate visual components or make contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update a large number of people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members; these methods are not always appropriate for long-form communications or building camaraderie.

You are the project manager for an organization that is currently shifting to agile project management. You have completed training for the Scrum methodology and you have been assigned your first team in a small IT project. You have been coaching the team on how Scrum works and the team likes the idea, but they are having trouble getting started when it comes to completing the project work during the sprint. Some of the team members are frustrated and do not know who should do what assignments. You explain that the team is to be self-organizing, but this does not help the team members much in getting to work. What should you do in this scenario?
Ask the product owner to help the team in sprint planning
Review the problem during the upcoming sprint retrospective
Correct answer
Coach the team in the early sprints
Send the team for additional training
Overall explanation
In organizations new to Agile, the project manager role should coach the team on who does what in the early iterations. This helps people get accustomed to the new project management methodology and the self-organizing aspect of agile project management. Over time, the team will need less coaching and will be able to determine who will do what tasks in the sprint backlog. The project manager role should coach the team now – additional training is not really needed, but some coaching is. The product owner is not the best choice for helping the team determine assignments in the iteration. Waiting until the iteration is too late – the time to do the work, the sprint, is done when the team goes into the iteration. Daily help from the project manager is what is needed in the early iterations with a team that is new to agile.

Maria is a project manager for her organization operating in a strong matrix structure. Right now, she is working on a communication plan as well as a stakeholder engagement strategy. Maria is well supported by her company's board and senior management. They trust her judgment, and her projects have been a success. The company recently went public, so there are thousands of new shareholders. In the past, Maria has focused on key stakeholders on the board and in senior management. Should Maria's strategy change since the company is now publicly traded?
Correct answer
She should view every shareholder and customer as a stakeholder.
She should include stockholders who own large amounts of shares in the company.
No, she still answers to the same group.
She should exclude shareholders but include customers as stakeholders.
Overall explanation
Maria needs to view every shareholder and customer as a stakeholder. She should widen her viewpoint on stakeholders before, but even more so as the company has gone public. Maria will naturally owe more information and focus to some more than others within this large group of stakeholders. She does need to include all stakeholders in her communication plans and shareholder engagement strategy. Even though Maria still answers to the same group, when a company goes public, there will be a change in stakeholder number and engagement levels. All stockholders are stakeholders in the company, not only the ones with large amounts of shares. Stakeholders are anyone who can affect the project or are affected by the project. While she may not include all of her communication to all stakeholders, there will need to be a communication plan and stakeholder engagement plan for the new stakeholders caused by the company going public.

John is a programmer and is often described by his teammates as intense and focused. John prefers to dig into the code and work until his objectives and goals are met. Sandra, the project manager, is described as a charismatic leader who likes to interact with her project team members. When communicating with John, an action-oriented person, Sandra should take which of the following approaches
Correct answer
Be as brief as possible.
Remain patient.
Speak quickly to ensure that all the information gets conveyed.
Provide options, including the pros and cons.
Overall explanation
Being as brief as possible is the best approach for communicating with an action-oriented person. While John may appreciate Sandra's interactions, his focus is on completing the work rather than building a relationship with the project manager. This question does not introduce the need for options or the pros and cons of an issue. Sandra and John should remain patient, but the best choice is to be brief as possible and not interrupt John. The speed of talking does not ensure that the information is conveyed.

You are the project manager of a software development project that is leading a project using scrum methodologies. Your team is new to agile project management practices, so you are coaching the team and the product owner on how to write user stories. Which of the following choices is an example of a user story?
A WBS statement that describes the work, its functionality, and why the customer wants the deliverable.
Correct answer
A work ticket that states, "As a software user, I want this button to be clickable so that I can access the webpage."
A set of notes formulated from a meeting with the project sponsor that contains the project requirements.
An issue noted in the project's issue log that needs to be resolved and the reason why.
Overall explanation
A user story is a short description of a feature told from the perspective of the user. User stories follow the formula of "As a ROLE, I want this FUNCTIONALITY, so that I can achieve this GOAL. Therefore, a work ticket stating, "As a software user, I want this button to be clickable so that I can access the webpage," is an example of a user story. Notes from a meeting do not qualify as a user story. An issue in the issue log is also not an example of a user story as it is not a request from the user. An entry in the WBS dictionary is not an example of a user story because it is not written from the user's perspective. In addition, agile projects do not utilize a work breakdown structure, so this choice is incorrect.

Donald, the project sponsor, has asked Phoebe to relate the project requirements and activities to the project's strategic objectives. Which document contains the mentioned information that Donald is requesting?
Scope statement
Mind map
Correct answer
Requirements traceability matrix 
Context diagram
Overall explanation
The requirements traceability matrix will contain information that relates to project requirements and strategic objectives. A requirements traceability matrix shows each requirement as it moves through each phase of the project work to completion. A project's scope statement will not necessarily explicitly state the relationship between a project's requirements and the strategic objective; it will simply state the scope. While helpful, a context diagram does not relate the project requirements to the strategic objectives; it defines the scope. A mind map is useful to collect requirements but does not necessarily relate them to strategic objectives.

Patrick is a full-time scrum master on an agile team. The team is cross-functional and self-organizing, with an average velocity of 40 story points per two-week iteration. During the sprint retrospective meeting for the just-concluded sprint, the development team raises the need to have a separate QA team. The team will ensure better code coverage and quality control. As an experienced scrum master, what should Patrick advise the team?
Accept the request and add a dedicated team of QA testers who can focus only on testing the developed increment.
Ignore the request since no quality issues have been reported thus far.
Correct answer
Inform the team that all the necessary testing and quality checks should be part of the Definition of Done.
Use a separate "testing sprint" to perform all the required tests for the completed increment before starting the next sprint.
Overall explanation
The Definition of Done for the scrum team is used to assess when work is complete on the product increment. This includes acceptance criteria and all checks needed to ensure the quality of the code. The team must work to refine the definition of done for the upcoming sprints, including tests in the Definition of Done increases transparency for the development team, which will verify how close the work is to completion and potentially releasable. Having a separate dedicated QA team would make the team less cross-functional and create waste. Ignoring the request would be inappropriate. Large development teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be useful. There is no testing sprint in scrum.

Which of the following is the most effective solution for remote working and communication?
Use headphones with a built-in microphone.
Correct answer
Use a quiet location in your home.
Mute audio when not speaking.
Use noise-canceling software.
Overall explanation
Finding a quiet location in your home should be attempted first, and this should include elements for sound absorption. However, this may not reduce sounds from the computer and would need to be combined with additional measures. The other solutions are valid choices, but the best option is the most logical, is first to have team members use a quiet location for communication.

Howard is the director of the project management office. He has recently had his team take a personality test to help determine their communication style. He has learned that he is an extrovert that thrives on interaction and actively participating with peers on projects. However, several members of his team are introverts. They require more individual time and focus. This has helped him understand why there have been conflicts in the past. Now he must develop a way for both the extroverts and introverts on his team to collaborate in a more streamlined manner with fewer conflicts. What is a way he can achieve this?
Allow everyone to work remotely so that each person can process as needed.
Make the extroverts cater to the introverts so that there is less perceived conflict.
Correct answer
Present the information, allow time for those who need it to process things individually, then come back for a brainstorming session.
Disregard the test results and continue to make everyone work together in an active environment. After all, it worked before.
Overall explanation
By allowing everyone to process, research, and think individually, Howard is allowing the introverts to figure out ways to collaborate without being put on the spot immediately. It also gives the extroverts time to gather resources and connections. Disregarding the test results and making the team continue as things are, does not make the project better or acknowledge the testing results. Working remotely does not address the situation or fix any conflicts in the project. Making the extroverts cater to the introverts is not a practical solution.

The project is losing money.
Correct answer
The project is behind schedule.
The project is 80 percent complete.

Overall explanation
A schedule performance index of 0.80 means the project is behind schedule. The closer the SPI is to 1, the better. An SPI of 0.80 means the project is behind schedule, not ahead of schedule. The SPI deals with the project schedule, not money. The SPI does not reflect the percentage complete of the project.

Angela works for a Family Credit Union, which would like customers to open new accounts online. The best example of a Minimum Viable Product for this functionality on their website is:
Correct answer
A webpage where the customer provides the minimum information, while Angela’s team manually creates the account behind the scenes during business hours.
A webpage that only provides basic information about opening new accounts when you click on an “Open a New Account” tab.
A webpage where the customer provides the minimum information, which is released only after the code for creating new accounts has been completed.
A webpage that allows customers to quickly set up checking, savings, and money market accounts in an automatic way.
Overall explanation
Even if back-end processes have not been fully automated, a web page that allows customers to open a new account is the best example of an MVP with the required functionality. The webpage where the customer submits the information to a manual processor would be more of a minimal approach. A webpage that fully automates the back-end processes is not the best choice for an MVP. A webpage that only provides basic information does not have the required functionality of allowing customers to open new accounts online.

You are the project manager for BTC International, which is a large steel corporation. You must negotiate with a larger corporation for services that only they can provide in the time frame you have for completion. You have tried the win-win approach, and the supplier is standing firm on their requirements. What other approach could you consider to ensure mutual agreement and less risk than a soft or hard negotiation?
Give in and accept the supplier's terms even though it will cost more and could cause impediments for the project in the long run.
Inform the supplier that BTC International will no longer be doing business if they do not agree to the terms presented.
Correct answer
Use an economic-adjusted contract where you can find mutual interest options that meet the objective criteria while focusing on interests and can lead to a win-win.
Choose not to consider any other options. Then inform the product owner that you have done an exhaustive search and cannot find a supplier to meet the project's deadlines.
Overall explanation
An economic-based contract allows the price of the materials to rise and fall in accordance with economic standards. This is ideal for longer contracts where commodities, such as the price of steel or lumber, will fluctuate, so the price of the resources are adjusted periodically in the contract—both the buyer and seller share in the risk and cost exposure of the materials. Choosing not to consider any other options and informing the product owner that you have done an exhaustive search is not an honest statement by the project manager. It is not the seller's responsibility to adjust their price based on the longevity of the purchasing organization. This choice does not attempt to negotiate for a win-win solution, so it is not the best choice presented.

In which of the following situations are the agile principles not being properly applied?
The Blaze Comics developers complete their work in a system that continuously integrates their new work into the existing product.
Correct answer
The Blaze Comics project team thoroughly tests all items in their iterations. Each cycle spans a calendar quarter in which items are developed, completed, and tested until the feature is fully implemented.
The Blaze Comics team performs a demonstration of their latest work in each weekly iteration, gathering new requirements and receiving an updated priority regularly during these demonstrations.
The Blaze Comics project team releases all items within each weekly iteration to their test environment, where the product owner receives a demo of each cycle of what has been completed.
Overall explanation
A single cycle that spans a calendar quarter is beyond the recommendation within agile principles. They also are releasing fully-featured items, which ignores the principle of releasing regular results to a test environment to allow for feedback opportunities. All of the other answer choices are incorrect as these remaining choices are all appropriate ways of implementing the agile principle of delivering software frequently.

As your organization's project manager, you are leading a technical project that will affect the entire organization. Several stakeholders are worried about the change, so they want to ensure the project is meeting quality. The head of your project management office has asked you to alert them to any cost of nonconformance. Which of the following examples should be reported based on this request?
You provide training to the entire team to ensure quality standards are met, totaling about $200 per staff member. 
Correct answer
A customer cancels a $10,000 purchase order and decides to do business with a competitor. 
You spend $400 to circulate a survey to customers to measure satisfaction. 
Your firm hires a team of researchers for $20,000 to evaluate areas of the organization that can be improved. 
Overall explanation
The voiding of a purchase order by a customer is an example of a cost of nonconformance. Nonconformance costs include the cost of lost business, as is the case here. The cost of nonconformance, sometimes called the cost of poor quality, is the negative aspect of not meeting quality requirements. Training is an example of the cost of conformance to quality. A customer satisfaction survey is an example of the cost of conformance to quality. Looking for areas of improvement, specifically, the cost required to find these areas needing improvement is a cost of conformance to quality.

While the Executive Director may have positional power and Jim could be a little intimidated by the fact that the Executive Director told him not to report the truth, Jim is responsible as the project manager to be ethical and fair and provide an unbiased update. Since the tasks technically are not late yet, reporting that the tasks are normal and on track is not the best choice just because Executive Director did not want any reporting on the tasks. Jim needs to resolve the issue with the Executive Director.

Stephanie, the head of your quality assurance department, has just inspected a work package prototype ahead of meeting with the customer. Stephanie has informed you that the prototype looks good, and she expects the customer to be pleased. At this point:
No more change requests can be received.
Correct answer
The prototype is a verified deliverable.
The project is complete as soon as the prototype is given to the customer.
The prototype is a validated deliverable.
Overall explanation
At this point, the prototype is a verified deliverable. A verified deliverable is a deliverable that is completed before meeting with a customer. A verified deliverable means that it has been inspected for quality and is deemed acceptable. The customer, however, will do scope validation, and that leads to formal acceptance. This is not a validated deliverable because the customer has not yet accepted it. The project will not be complete when the prototype is delivered to the customer because several other processes need to occur before closing a project. Change requests could also still be received at this point. This is especially true if the customer is not pleased with the deliverable. Change requests can happen at any point in the project before the customer has validated a deliverable.

Jasmine is the project manager for Project DSG, which is in its fifth week of deployment. This project has a budget of $1,950,000 and is on schedule. The project sponsor has expressed that the budget cannot be greater than five percent of its target, and the schedule must be strictly maintained to hit a marketplace window opportunity. While reviewing an upcoming milestone, Jasmine notices several project team members will be on vacation in the days leading up to the milestone due date. What should Jasmine do next?
Correct answer
Determine the impact on Project DSG

Cancel the team member's vacations
Fast track impacted tasks
Escalate the issue to the steering committee
Overall explanation
Before acting, Jasmine should determine the effect the team member's vacation may have on the project's milestone. The vacation time may be acceptable, but she should first determine if the absence will affect the milestone due date. Once she understands the impact, she can take appropriate action. Canceling the team member's vacations without understanding the impact will negatively impact Jasmine's relationships and hurt team morale. The steering committee is unlikely to assist in this scenario. Fast-tracking the affected tasks may not be possible, and the vacation schedules may still impact the milestone due date.

A portion of the project work is contracted to a third-party vendor who has a history of excellent work but is often late with deliverables. The project manager assesses the risk events to find the most likely to impact the project's schedule. Which mitigation tool could the project manager use with this vendor to encourage on-time delivery and discourage lateness?
Disincentive for late work
Intermittent schedule checks
Incentives for work completed on time
Correct answer
Incentive and disincentives for work completion
Overall explanation
A contract that uses incentives, such as a bonus, for work completed on time – and disincentives for late work is the best choice presented. Incentives for work completed on time is nice, but there is no financial punishment if the vendor is late, so this option is not the best choice. Disincentive for late work does punish the vendor if they are late, but there is no incentive to get the work done quickly and accurately, so this is not the best choice presented. Intermittent schedule checks do not do much to get the vendor to deliver the work on time as the project needs, so this is not the best choice presented.

Suzanne is the scrum master for Project I, seven iterations into deployment, and has a velocity of 22 story points. A stakeholder raised the possibility of a new risk occurring during a recent sprint review that would add substantial work to Project I but is not likely to occur. What should Suzanne do next?
Correct answer
Add the risk to the risk register and regularly review it.
Ignore the risk since it has a low likelihood.
Have her development team prepare mitigation strategies for the risk.
Escalate the problem to the project management office.
Overall explanation
Suzanne should add this risk to her risk register and record all relevant information about it. This will allow the project team to have an appropriate response if the risk occurs. Preparing mitigation strategies is not the best response as the risk must also be added to the risk register. Escalating the problem to the project management office does not allow Suzanne to prepare for the risk. Ignoring the risk is not a good option as it may still occur and impact Project I.

Bernie is a stakeholder on the Circuit Development Project. Virginia, the project manager for the Circuit Development Project, recently asked Bernie to speak to another stakeholder and ask for their support in adjusting the schedule of the Circuit Development Project. Bernie agreed but is a bit confused as to why Virginia did not ask herself. What is the likely reason Virginia asked Bernie to help?
It is the responsibility of stakeholders to communicate with other stakeholders about the schedule.
Virginia is busy and cannot fit it into her schedule.
Virginia does not know the other stakeholder.
Correct answer
Virginia believes Bernie will be able to influence the other stakeholder more easily.
Overall explanation
Virginia likely believes Bernie has a better chance of successfully influencing the other stakeholder to support the adjustment. Virginia being busy would not prevent her from approaching the other stakeholder. It is the project manager's responsibility to communicate with stakeholders. If Virginia does not know the other stakeholder, she should introduce herself. Stakeholder identification and engagement, especially with stakeholders that can approve schedule changes, should happen early in the project.

Hector's project team is working with the project's customers to write user stories. However, there is resistance among the customers because they do not see how the user stories will benefit the project. Of the following choices, which is the best way for Hector and his project team to resolve this resistance so that the project can move forward?
Give up on the concept and tell the customers that the user stories are not needed.
Correct answer
Have the project team explain and prove to the customers the value and benefits of user stories.
The project manager writes the user stories when using the agile methodology, so the customers do not need to be involved in the process anyway.
Allow the project team to write the user stories without the customer's input.
Overall explanation
User stories are an informal, basic explanation of a software feature written from the end-user or customer's perspective. In an agile project, they provide benefits to both the team and the customers. The project team must have the ability to explain the benefits of user stories to the customer, as this is a vital part of the project. User stories are needed in agile projects to define the project requirements for the product backlog. Allow the project team to write the user stories without the customer's input is not the best choice as the team needs the customers' input to the process. The project manager writes the user stories when using the agile methodology, so the customers do not need to be involved in the process anyway. The development team and the product owner write the user stories in the project with input from the customers or key stakeholders.

Earnest is the scrum master for a project which is in its fifth iteration, has a velocity of 152 story points, and has $100,000 remaining in its budget. While reviewing the backlog with the product owner, Earnest determines the project will need to bring in a consultant to assist with some complex stories that the development team cannot handle. What should Earnest do next?
Correct answer
Update the budget to account for the consultant’s time.
Tell the project team to expect help.
Get his team’s opinion at the next sprint review.
Do nothing. The project is progressing well and has a budget available.
Overall explanation
Earnest should update the budget to ensure it accounts for finding a consultant. Doing nothing does not address the need for the consultant. Telling the team to expect help is not good communication, and this answer does not address the planning needed for the consultant. It is good to get feedback from the team, but the sprint review is not the best meeting to ask for this type of discussion.

She is negotiating with the project customer to consider inflation, cost of utilities, and other cost factors that will likely fluctuate over the project’s life cycle. Of the following responses, which is the type of contract Celia should have?
Fixed-price incentive fee
Cost-plus award fee
Lump-sum
Correct answer
Fixed-price with economic price adjustments
Overall explanation
For cost categories that are likely to increase over a project’s duration, projects that often last for several years use a fixed-price contract with economic adjustment. A lump-sum contract does not account for price fluctuations for economic variables like inflation and is therefore incorrect. A contract that is a fixed-price incentive fee is incorrect because it does not accommodate for price fluctuations of economic variables such as inflation. A cost-plus award fee contract does not accommodate for price fluctuations for economic variables such as inflation and is therefore incorrect.

Correct answer
Yes, alignment early on is essential to success.
No, this can be done later once the deliverables are completed.
No, the stakeholders should figure this out for themselves.
Yes, delivery planning is one phase of project planning.
Overall explanation
Ensuring all stakeholders are aligned on how, when and to whom benefits are realized is essential to success as it will help avoid conflicts later.

Renée is creating a stakeholder management document. In it, she attempts to record the skills of the various stakeholders on her project. Her goal is to have an objective, unbiased, and fair assessment of each stakeholder's capabilities to know which stakeholder to approach regarding different aspects of the project. Renée is a kind person and prefers to think the best of people. When appraising her stakeholder's skills, which error should she try to avoid?
Recency error
Personal Bias
Correct answer
Strictness or leniency error
Central tendency error
Overall explanation
The strictness or leniency error is the tendency for an appraiser to grade in an excessively strict or lenient manner. Nothing is good enough, or everything is good enough, which makes ratings effectively meaningless. The recency error is the tendency to over-exaggerate a good or bad event simply because it occurred recently. Central tendency error is the habit of assigning a middling rating to all employees for all skills, which is unlikely and unhelpful. Personal bias is a non-objective perspective based on an appraiser's experiences and preferences rather than objective measures.

The kill point
Overall explanation
Based on the end result of a phase, management or the customer may elect to kill a project. Progressive elaboration is the refinement of the project concept as the project progresses.

Diego is working on a project that will affect all 1,342 stakeholders in his organization, Gaston Tech. A stakeholder register should be created, but a team member has asked if it is necessary to create 1,342 register entries. Is it necessary?
Correct answer
Yes, but grouping stakeholders for easier management is appropriate.
No, only negative and key stakeholders should be identified in the stakeholder register.
No, only key stakeholders should be documented in the stakeholder register.
Yes, all stakeholders should be identified.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is yes; for easier management, it is best to group stakeholders when there are this many stakeholders in a project. For example, stakeholders can be grouped by organizational roles, departments, even project interest levels. Instead of managing numerous messages to multiple stakeholders, putting stakeholders in groups helps the project manager communicate a common message to a large group of people. It is not necessary or feasible to identify each stakeholder individually when putting them into groups will suffice. Even though key stakeholders should be identified in the register, the project manager must also document and record the stakeholder groupings. Positive and negative stakeholders should both be recorded in the stakeholder register, not just the negative ones.

Some senior stakeholders, who are strong advocates of the traditional development approach, have shown strong resistance to agile practices and are not happy with the change. They are engaged in other projects that your project has dependencies on. As an agile coach, what would you coach your team to be the best way to share their progress with other project stakeholders?
Scrum of scrums
Correct answer
Information radiators
Daily standup meetings
Retrospective meetings
Overall explanation
An information radiator, also referenced as a big visible chart, is a comprehensive display of key team information, openly shared with all team members and other stakeholders and continuously updated. It includes information such as the task board, the count of automated tests, the team velocity, incident reports, continuous integration status, the state of work packages, or the team's progress. Therefore, agile teams use the most popular and effective tools to share their progress with other project stakeholders. Standup meetings are used to share information within the team. Retrospectives are primarily for the team's benefit to create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration and not sharing progress.

Victoria is the project manager for Project Z, which is in its fourth week of a planned twelve-week implementation and has spent $50,000 of a $150,000 budget. Recently she noticed about thirty percent of the project tasks had been completed, though the project is to be sixty percent complete by today's date. Victoria calculates Project Z's SPI and sends an update to project stakeholders. What is the update most likely to say?
The project is on budget.
Correct answer
The project is behind schedule.
The project is on schedule.
The project is ahead of schedule.
Overall explanation
To find the answer to this question, you will need the SPI formula of Earned Value/Planned Value. Earned value is 30 percent of the budget, which is $50,000. Planned value is what the project should be worth today, which is $90,000. The formula is $50,000/90,000 for an SPI of .55. The formula to find the SPI is Earned Value (EV) divided by Planned Value (PV). The project is late and not on the budget to be complete as planned.

Tim determines the money went towards correcting an escaped defect from the prior week. The change control board approved the cost and update. What should Tim do next?
Correct answer
Update his stakeholders on the variance.
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Do nothing. The cost was approved, and the project is still on budget.
Reprimand the team for not properly recording the charge.
Overall explanation
While the change was approved, Tim should also ensure stakeholders are aware of the discrepancy between the reports. This will help ensure everyone is on the same page and prevent anyone from being surprised. Doing nothing is not optimal as it risks a stakeholder finding the discrepancy and being confused. Reprimanding the team will not ensure the budget is balanced correctly. Escalating the issue to the steering committee is not ideal as the change was approved.

He should never use this type of tool in any circumstance.
This set of tools is good to implement if he focuses only on the overall release.

Just before you are finished for the day, the customer stops by your office to discuss one small change for a piece of equipment. The change is minor and would not take the project team more than three days to complete the work. The customer is willing to pay for the work. What should you do next?
Contact the senior management team, report the request, and let them know the customer is willing to pay for the change request.
Approach the sponsor and ask her for permission to add this small change as part of this project.
Submit a request to the change control board for approval.
Correct answer
Inform the customer that this change cannot be done as part of the project since the project's scope is completed.
Overall explanation
The project is now closed. The project sponsor and customer have accepted the work, the project team has been disbanded, and the project information has been archived. Once the project is closed, as in this case, no additional change requests can be made. The customer should now ask for a new project, albeit small, to make the adjustments to the equipment. This is a great example of an exam question you may face. It is a simple change, and in the "real world," the team may be asked to make the adjustment, but technically, the project is closed, and the change request cannot be entered. A project manager should not ask a project sponsor to change the project scope as the project is officially closed. Senior management is not the best choice for this scenario; senior management is focused on other objectives, and the project is closed. A change request should not be submitted to the change control board because the customer has accepted all project deliverables.

John loves the fast changes that come with his assigned projects, but sometimes he struggles with one aspect. A few core personalities dominate his organization; one is named Linda. Linda can approve a charter and get a project going based on her word, a blessing and a curse for John. Linda is an ally, so she can sometimes get a project moving that might otherwise not go anywhere. On the other hand, Linda sometimes asks the team to initiate projects based on her preference and instinct. John is getting heat from people inside the organization who sometimes have trouble seeing every project's value. How can John show the benefits of some of these controversial projects?
Compare the projects to company stock price.
Ignore complaints.
Correct answer
Do a cost-benefit analysis on each project.
Direct complaints to Linda.
Overall explanation
Cost-benefit analysis or any benefit analysis, for that matter, is for new projects. This will give John the ammunition he needs to justify his projects. If a project has a low cost-to-benefit ratio, he can present that to someone like Linda. Linda now has a chance to see the results of her instinctual choices in black and white. If she chooses to proceed with a seemingly ill-advised project, then the onus is on her. While powerful stakeholders can often drive a project, a benefits analysis should be employed even if an individual or group drives the project with significant power. Ignoring the complaints does not resolve the issue or show the value of the project. Sending the complaints to Linda does not resolve the issue or show the value of the project. Comparing the projects to the company stock price is not a good correlation.

He does not have much time to assess detailed reports, and his time is often booked for months in advance. He prefers to be contacted only when a project goes off its timeline or new risks are discovered; otherwise, he assumes that his projects are going well. Which method should the project manager use to build trust and influence with the stakeholder?
Progress reporting
Correct answer
Issue identification
Surveys
Meetings
Overall explanation
Issue identification is the best way to build additional trust and influence with a stakeholder who already has a high level of trust with the project team. By protecting a stakeholder's time and only bringing important issues to their attention, a project manager sets themselves up as a trusted advisor, making influence easier to obtain. Meetings are a useful way to build trust and influence with stakeholders if they have a lot of free time and prefer to work through issues organically. Progress reporting is helpful if stakeholders prefer to keep a close watch on the status of projects. Surveys are appropriate if a stakeholder requires the input of many people in addition to the project manager's personal input.

What stakeholder management strategy should Claire utilize for Leeann?
Keep Leeann satisfied.
Correct answer
Keep Leeann informed.
Manage Leeann closely.

In a typical power/interest grid, Leeann falls under a low-power/high-interest stakeholder category. For this reason, Leeann should only be kept informed. Managing Leeann closely is not the best choice as she has low authority, but high interest. Keeping a stakeholder satisfied is useful when the stakeholder has high authority, but low interest in the project or work.

Based on the scenario above, what kind of cost planning technique best describes what the client wants Susan to utilize?
Bottom-up
Correct answer
Target value design
Top-down
Analogous
Overall explanation
Target value design's main idea is to make the client's value the driver of the design, thereby reducing waste and satisfying or even exceeding the client's expectations. It looks for the lowest actual cost and delivering the maximum value as defined by the owner. TVD also aims at turning the reactive budgeting approach into a proactive approach. Top-down estimating is based on the relationship between cost and the number of functional units. It is the simplest and quickest method to implement but must be used with care as it is employed where a deficiency of information exists upon which to base the calculation.  Analogous estimating uses former projects to estimate how long or how much a current project will take or cost. Bottom-up estimating is the process of quantifying the labor, material, and plant quantities with the project. It requires the most time and effort to prepare.

Roger should meet with the new CIO as soon as possible and perform a stakeholder analysis. This will allow the CIO to learn about the project and help Roger confront the risk of the project derailment. Seeing if anyone from the project team knows the new CIO does not effectively address the issue and does not directly help the project manager and the new CIO meet each other and learn about the project. Speaking with the CIO about the importance of the project remaining in place is not the best choice as there is no evidence the CIO wants to shut down the project. New stakeholders, such as the CIO, certainly may have influence over the project.

Mark, a project manager, leads a team planning meeting every Monday morning. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the necessary work for the week. Mark's typical preparation for the meeting is to assemble a list of outstanding tasks, which he reads out during the meeting. Once everyone agrees on the work to be done, Mark ends the meeting. However, almost all the team members individually approach Mark after the meeting. They typically ask what they are responsible for, the specifics of a given task, or the due date for a task. As a result, Mark spends a lot of time reviewing the tasks one on one. How can Mark support team task accountability?
Make the meeting longer.
Correct answer
Give each task a timeline, owner, and priority in the meeting.
Schedule a second meeting to assign task specifics.
Circulate a detailed task chart and cancel the meeting.
Overall explanation
The planning meeting is the proper time to enumerate, assign, and confirm a task's ownership, timelines, and specifics. Having employees claim the tasks in the presence of other employees supports task accountability. Creating a detailed task chart each week is very time-consuming and requires subject matter expertise that task owners are better equipped to provide. There is no need to schedule a follow-up meeting if the first meeting's original purpose remains unfulfilled. Making the meeting longer is unlikely to result in the concrete next steps required to instill accountability. Longer meetings are often a waste of time.

You were in the proof of concept and discovery phase of a new lunar satellite. Following the concept and discovery phases of the project, you were assigned as the project manager for leading this initiative. You would like to work with several people involved in the proof of concept as your project team members. Before proceeding with a new project, you must first
Request to have the project team resources
Create the project scope statement
Engage all stakeholders in the initiative
Correct answer
Obtain project charter approval
Overall explanation
Obtaining project charter approval is the correct answer. Before starting any project, you must have an approved charter. The project charter authorizes the start of the project and allows the ability for business resources to be acquired for project work. The stakeholders are groups or individuals affected by the project and may not be known until after the project is approved. Before building the project team, it is best to have a project charter. The project scope statement identifies what is and is not included in the project and requires the project charter as an input.

After examining the basic requirements, he determines Bag Corporation does not have the needed resources to complete the work required to satisfy the project scope. What should Nick do next?
Hire a consultant to complete the project work.
Base his estimate on past projects.
Correct answer
Issue requests for information
Build the work breakdown structure.
Overall explanation
Given that Bag Corporation has not done this type of work before, Nick will need to gather information from outside sources. Issuing a request for information asks vendors to provide information about their company and services. Bag Corporation has not performed this work before, so there is no historical information. Hiring a consultant is not the best option yet, because the project has not yet been launched. A work breakdown structure is not the best option as the project has not yet been launched.

The scrum team is working in iterations to develop an online game. The product will have three beta releases before launch. During the middle of sprint three, the product owner revises the sprint backlog by adding a new feature to save additional clicks and improve the user experience. He ensures that the sprint goal is unchanged. Which entity is permitted to add work to the sprint backlog during the sprint?
The scrum team
The product owner
The scrum master
Correct answer
The development team
Overall explanation
The sprint backlog is a gauge for the development team to show the functionality in the next increment. It also discloses the work that will be necessary to deliver that functionality into a “done” increment. The development team is the only entity that can alter its sprint backlog during a sprint. The sprint backlog is a highly transparent and real-time picture of what the development team plans to accomplish during the sprint, and it belongs solely to the development team. The scrum team includes the scrum master, the product owner, and the development team. Only the development team may add tasks to their sprint backlog, so this choice is incorrect. If the product owner wants to change the work planned during the sprint, they should do this in accordance with the development team. The scrum master cannot add items to the sprint backlog.

When following agile best practices, like review activities and iterative planning, what type of risk management occurs?
Inherent risk management
Intrinsic risk management
Overt risk management
Correct answer
Organic risk management
Overall explanation
Risk management concepts that are employed on agile projects can be classified as either "organic" or "overt." Organic risk management occurs naturally by following agile best practices such as iterative planning and review activities. Inherent risk management is not a technical risk management term, but describes the fundamental risk management practices projects should adapt. Overt risk management refers to implementing specific strategies to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks on your agile project using specific agile risk management tools and techniques. Risk-adjusted backlogs, variance and trend analysis, risk burndown charts, etc., are common examples of overt risk management concepts. Intrinsic risk management is not a valid risk management term, but describes the fundamental risk management practices.

This scenario is an example of resource requirements. To be successful, the Sterling Project needs a certain resource, a chemical engineer. A resource requirement is defined as a resource the project needs. A resource constraint may include a requirement that a resource must have available when certain activities are happening or a requirement that the project must use as a particular resource.

During a meeting with a high-interest, high-power stakeholder, she realizes that the stakeholder assumes that they can continue adding requests throughout the project's life cycle. In this case, they have specified that the supplement Simona's team is responsible for producing should have a cherry flavor. Simona checks the project charter and confirms that the supplement was initially slated to be unflavored. What should Simona do next?
Perform an impact analysis of change requests.
Present a change request to the project team.
Implement the changes.
Correct answer
Start a new change request.
Overall explanation
Because this is a new change request and all change requests must be documented, the best choice is to start a new change request for the project. Impact analysis identifies how a change request affects other tasks or phases of the project. Presenting change requests to the change control board is the path to getting change requests approved (or rejected). Implementing approved changes is the final step in the change request process, at which point the change requests are fully incorporated into the project plan.

Several stakeholders complain that Deborah has scheduled a series of meetings to review all the project's work. The stakeholders are not interested in the review session and only want the deliverables implemented into the organization. When asked, what is Deborah's most likely response to why these meetings are scheduled?
Her product manager asked Deborah to set up these meetings.
Deborah is nervous that her team missed something.
Correct answer
These meetings will allow the stakeholders to confirm everything was completed as intended.
Several stakeholders missed meetings earlier in the project.
Overall explanation
Formal scope validation and acceptance meetings are important to a project's success. These allow stakeholders to examine deliverables and confirm the scope of the project has been met. Deborah being nervous that her team has missed something is not a valid reason to hold a meeting to review the project's work. Stakeholders missing earlier meetings is not an adequate reason to hold review sessions. Product managers are part of agile projects, not predictive projects.

Richard should determine what information is missing and then set up a process by which the team receives that information quickly. This will allow them to continue progress. Telling the project team to figure it out on their own is not ideal as they will be pulled away from performing project work.

Thomas, the product owner, wants to know when the project can be forecasted to be done and the final product released to the customers. If there are 180 user story points in the product backlog, when can this project be completed?
8 weeks
When the team completes all of the user requirements
24 weeks
Correct answer
32 weeks
Overall explanation
Based on this information in this scenario, the project can be completed in 32 weeks. This is found by taking the remaining story points in the product backlog, 180, and dividing it by the velocity of 24. This equates to 8 sprints. Each sprint is four weeks in duration, so 32 total weeks. Yes, when the team completes all of the user requirements, the product can be completed, but this is not a precise answer for the product owner. 8 weeks is not a valid calculation of the time remaining in the project, so this choice is incorrect. 24 weeks is not a valid calculation of the time remaining in the project, so this choice is incorrect.

All levels of the WBS roll up to the higher levels to ensure that nothing is left out of the project and no extra work is performed within the project. What project management rule describes this WBS type of structure?
The law of diminishing returns
The timetable to create the WBS

The 100 percent rule states that the WBS includes all deliverables to ensure that only what is included in the WBS is what is created in the project. All lower WBS levels can roll up into the higher levels to equate to the project as a whole. The law of diminishing returns describes the effect of added labor and the return for that labor. The priority of the project does not affect the decomposition of the project. The timetable to create the WBS does not dictate the level of detail required for decomposition.

For everyone, the first step is to review the qualifications to become a PMP. Not everyone qualifies for the credential. Next, depending on the company's culture, having him moved to your department could benefit both of you. Having the drive to succeed and expand in certain skill areas can be great for any organization. With him being in your department, he can receive firsthand knowledge of what experienced project managers undertake and hands-on experience for the PMP requirements. Being mentored in project management by someone who is not a project manager is not a good solution. We all start somewhere. This choice is rude and dismissive of the individual's interest in project management and earning the PMP. Recommending books and classes is a good step but can be seen as dismissive rather than coaching the individual.

You are a project manager on a US $5,000 software development project that is proposed to be done using the agile development approach. The team is new to agile but has undergone training on agile principles and practices. While estimating the story points for a user story, the team believes that it will take 21 hours of effort to write the end-user training manual for the new product being developed. What should their estimate be for the task?
A range between 18 to 25 hours
18 hours, teams usually tend to overestimate
25 hours, to add some buffer for availability issues
Correct answer
21 hours
Overall explanation
Agile teams estimate tasks in "ideal time," i.e., how long it will take to complete a task if there are no interruptions and distractions. Therefore, if the team has decided that a task would take 21 hours, the estimate should reflect the same. Although agile teams rely on estimate ranges to convey the uncertainty associated with larger stories, task estimates are typically given single-point estimates because they are specific to the team and are made shortly before the work begins. The team should have enough information to understand what and how the task should be completed.

While reviewing the project schedule, Sam notices several tasks set to be completed by a contractor. He notes that the contract pays the vendor based on the amount of time they work and the cost of the materials they use. This type of contract exposes Sam's project to which of the following risks?
The vendor determines the incentive fee rather than Song Corporation.
Correct answer
Song Corporation is financially responsible for any wasted materials or delays by the vendor.
Sam will be unable to recoup any overcharges that the vendor may incur.
There is no risk as this only pays the vendor for work performed.
Overall explanation
This is a time and materials contract with a risk that the vendor may work excessive hours or waste materials. This may be mitigated by adding a not-to-exceed clause for the total hours worked, materials purchased, or require approval after a specific number of hours. There is a risk that the vendor could work more hours than anticipated or waste materials that Song Corporation will be responsible for paying based on the contract. This contract does not include an incentive fee, so this choice is incorrect.The risk is not including a not-to-exceed clause that allows the vendor to exceed the total anticipated cost of the contracted work.

While reviewing the upcoming sprint backlog with her development team, she notices a few stories pose a significant risk of requiring additional quality assurance and rework. The team estimates could take 20 story points of effort. What is the most appropriate strategy for dealing with this risk?
Find an additional developer to handle the risk event if it occurs.
Escalate the problem to the product owner.
Break those stories into multiple stories to mitigate the risk.
Correct answer
Commit to 100 story points in case the risk occurs, and if it does not, take on a few additional stories.
Overall explanation
By committing to only 100 story points, Sally gives her team the bandwidth to address the risk if it occurs. If it does not, the team will take a few additional stories to fill the gap. Breaking up stories is not a valid answer for this scenario. Escalating the problem to the product owner is not resolving the issue but passing it onto someone else.

Specifically, the development team seems convinced that story points equate to the number of hours associated with a given task. What is a likely cause for this confusion?
The team uses story points in a novel way.
The team has worked on previous projects where story points were equivalent to hours.
Correct answer
The team is unfamiliar with agile terminology and needs a refresher.
The team was not invited to the last poker planning meeting.
Overall explanation
The team likely needs a refresher on how story point sizing is utilized in scrum. Story points represent the size of the user story in relation to the other user stories, not the number of hours needed to complete the work. The team should not be treating user story points as hours of work, so this is not a good choice. The team likely has not worked on previous projects where user story points were hours, as this organization has just recently adapted agile project management. The team would be invited to the poker planning meeting as that is the point if the organization is using that approach for story size estimating.

Gerald is the project manager for Project Nightsky, which is in its planning stages. During a recent stakeholder meeting, one stakeholder asked how Gerald can be sure 100 percent of Project Nightsky's requirements will be identified before project work begins. How is Gerald likely to respond?
Referring the stakeholder to the project management office.
Correct answer
By walking the stakeholder through the project scope and WBS.
Predictive projects ensure they catch all requirements.
By including more stakeholders.
Overall explanation
Gerald should walk the stakeholder through the project scope and the WBS to validate all the product scope requirements have been properly documented. In addition, the project manager should explain the change control process so that if additional requirements are added later in the project, these can be captured and planned for as well. Predictive projects do their best to catch everything, but sometimes additional items or changes are needed. The project management office is unlikely to assist since they provide assets to the project manager. The number of stakeholders does not guarantee that 100 percent of the requirements are identified.

Mary is the scrum master for a project just starting its fifth iteration and has a velocity of twenty-two story points. While planning for the next iteration with the product owner and development team, Mary reminds the team about a company holiday that will span three working days. How should the team adjust its plan for the next iteration?
Find a team that does not celebrate that holiday to pick up the slack.
Ask for volunteers from the project team to continue working.
Correct answer
Reduce the planned number of story points to account for the holiday.
The project is more important. Tell the project team to work through the holiday.
Overall explanation
The team should reduce the planned number of story points to account for the missing days. This will allow the team to continue work while giving them the break they deserve. Mary could tell the team to work through the holiday, but this would negatively impact their relationship and may not be legal in some areas. Asking for volunteers could work, but she would likely only get a few team members to agree, which would impair their relationship. Finding another team to pick up the slack is not optimal as that team is unfamiliar with this project.

Mark is a project manager for his organization. He recently started a new project that will span three countries and utilize remote workers. Mark is now in the process of assessing his assigned team for their skills and competencies to manage the project work better. Mark is looking for the right mixture of explicit and tacit knowledge throughout his team. Why is Mark concerned with acquiring and managing both explicit and tacit knowledge?
Mark wants to be in control of all the knowledge on the team.
Mark believes in sharing knowledge throughout the organization.
Mark is just being a good project manager and documenting all the knowledge on his team.
Correct answer
Mark understands that personal knowledge is equally as important as general knowledge.
Overall explanation
Tacit knowledge (personal knowledge) is equally as important as explicit knowledge (book knowledge). Mark knows that managing and sharing both types of knowledge among his team will allow better integration of the team knowledge into the project and increase success. Mark wanting to control all knowledge on the project team is not a realistic option. Mark believes in sharing knowledge throughout the organization, which may be good, but this choice does not answer the question. Mark is just being a good project manager and documenting all the knowledge on his team is not the best choice for the question regarding explicit and tacit knowledge.

Correct answer
Working in the Red Zone
Team transparency

You are the project manager of the Kernel Project for your organization. Your team has twenty team members that are collocated. Your organization has recently hired Dominque, a programmer, and he has been assigned to your project team. Dominque has questions about what is expected of him, how he needs to interact with various team members and stakeholders, and how to contribute to the daily standups. As the project manager, it is your responsibility to coach Dominque on these expectations. What document could you give to Dominque to help him better understand the team expectations?
Project management books
Correct answer
Team charter
Project management plan
Employee handbook
Overall explanation
A team charter contains the ground rules of how each team member should interact with each other. Human resources should provide the employee handbook, but this would not give much insight into project specific information. Project management books are a great resource in a project manager's library, but Dominque is a developer. In addition, books are not going to inform Dominque about project specifics. The project management plan is not the best choice presented and likely would not answer all of Dominque's questions about interacting on the project team.

Kevin needs to know when one of the upstream teams he manages will be done with a project deliverable so that he can pass it off to a downstream team. If he tells the downstream team to be ready too soon, they will stop taking on assignments from their primary workstream before Kevin has something for them to do. This leads to a lot of inefficiency in the form of downtime. On the other hand, if Kevin tells a downstream to be ready too late, they often have other assignments already, so Kevin's work is put on hold. What should Kevin do in this scenario?
Correct answer
Estimate and confirm completion times for upstream deliverables
Backlog grooming for any changes in the upstream work
Testing at all levels to see where bottlenecks may be
Acceptance test-driven development
Overall explanation
Estimation allows a project manager to determine how long a task or tasks will take to complete, allowing them to inform stakeholders and other teams of the approximate delivery date for a product or project. By confirming and frequently communicating with the status of the upstream teams, the downstream teams may have more confidence in scheduling their operational and project work. Testing at all levels forces teams to consider how some parts of a project or product interact with others to decrease errors and issues. Acceptance of test-driven development brings teams of developers, analysts, and stakeholders together to determine successful products and project thresholds. Backlog grooming makes teams review, revisit, and edit their outstanding work and adjust priorities as needed.

You are have been the project manager for the Beech Candy Company for the past six years. Recently, you have taken on an intern, Curtis, to shadow you so that he can learn more about the day-to-day operations of project management within your organization. As you review the project scope statement and work breakdown structure with him, he asks who should validate a project scope. How should you respond to Curtis?
The project stakeholders must validate the scope.
The head of the project management office must validate the scope.
The project manager must validate the scope.
Correct answer
Either a project customer or a project sponsor can validate the scope.
Overall explanation
Only the customer or project sponsor can validate the scope of a project. Scope validation is when the customer or project sponsor formally accepts the deliverables of a project. Scope validation is the review of the completed scope items and is done by the project customer or the project sponsor, not the project manager. Scope validation is the review of the completed scope items and is done by the project customer or the project sponsor. The project stakeholders include everyone affected by the project, including the project manager and the project team, so this choice is incorrect. The head of the project management office, if one exists, does not validate the scope. The scope is validated by the project sponsor or the project customer.

A company is working on a government contract for the first time. There are many compliance checks, and the company is unfamiliar with most of them, especially those related to regulatory and conflict of interest compliance. The company decides that it will hire a consultant for each compliance area and have them review the project parameters with an eye to their respective compliance. How is project compliance being managed?
Compliance audit
Compliance documentation
Correct answer
Compliance council
Compliance risk
Overall explanation
A compliance council is a group of compliance specialists that discusses compliance issues for a given project. Compliance documentation is the written overview of the various compliance requirements a project must meet. Compliance risk is the risk associated with not being compliant, for instance, with security needs. A compliance audit is run to determine if a project is compliant by its own or external standards.

Joe is a lead tester on an XP team. During testing, he discovers a problem. What should be done next?
Alert the other coders about the problem.
Try to fix the problem yourself.
Inform the customer and other stakeholders.
Correct answer
Discuss the issue with the developer.
Overall explanation
This question is checking whether you understand the agile approach to problem-solving. On an agile team, problems are approached and resolved collectively and not individually. Therefore, the lead tester should discuss the issue with the developer as the next step. Alerting other coders will not help solve the problem and is not the best thing to do next. Telling the customer and other stakeholders will not help solve the problem and is not the best thing to do next. Trying to fix the problem alone does not align with the agile methodology.

Caroline, a project manager at Develop-A-Community commercial development firm, has completed the final brainstorming session with her team and completed the WBS structure for her construction project. She and the team have also created a WBS dictionary which is shared for internal clients to review. The project sponsor reviews the WBS and does not feel that all the packages have been decomposed enough. What heuristic should Caroline follow when decomposing the project scope in a WBS?
Every activity corresponds to a work package.
Work packages can be cost estimated.
Correct answer
8/80 Rule
Work packages can be scheduled.
Overall explanation
The lowest level of activities within a WBS is a work package. The heuristic, which is a guideline, means that work packages should be between 80 hours of work and eight hours of work. Caroline does not want work packages that are too big and cumbersome but also does not want to get too granular in the details. Work packages can be scheduled, but it is not the heuristic to guide the decomposition of the project scope in the WBS. Work packages can have a cost estimate, but this is not the heuristic to guide the decomposition of the project scope in the WBS. The activity list is based on the work packages in the WBS, but this is not the best choice presented.

Sally is familiarizing herself with her team but is unsure about the expectations for team meetings, casual interactions, reporting, and other communications. What should Sally do next in this scenario?
Ask the steering committee for advice.
Correct answer
Review project documentation for the team's ground rules.
Ask the project team how things have been historically handled.
Write up a new guide on how the team should interact.
Overall explanation
Sally should review existing documentation to see what ground rules have been written down. This will allow her to understand current expectations. The project team may know the ground rules, but it is not the best place to start. While historical information can be a good resource, recollections are not as definite as a written document in the project. Writing a new guide is not the best choice as Sally should first determine if there is existing documentation for the project ground rules. Asking the steering committee is not the best choice; it is always best for the project manager to research and take on the challenges before escalating to management.

One of Andre's stakeholders is active on their company's instant messaging service. They are so active that they contact Andre almost constantly throughout the day, making it difficult or impossible for Andre to complete his work. Typically, the stakeholder asks questions that have already been answered, and they expect responses to their questions within a couple of minutes of sending a message. If they do not get a response from Andre quickly enough, they typically reach out to one of Andre's employees, resulting in more disruptions and potentially the spread of out-of-date or incorrect information. Andre spends some time reviewing the stakeholder's messages and decides that most of them could be answered by a shared repository containing a FAQ document. Andre decides to create such a repository and document and direct the stakeholder to it whenever they ask questions. Andre instructs his team to do the same. Which aspect of expert judgment is the project manager using to create ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement?
Correct answer
Communication methods and strategies
Analytical and assessment techniques
Environment and culture of the organization
Requirements management
Overall explanation
Stakeholder engagement ground rules should always contain detailed, specific information about communication methods and strategies. Without a standardized rule, communication can quickly become inefficient or completely ineffective. Analytical and assessment techniques can be used to create ground rules but are most often used to identify problems rather than solve them. Requirements management should be included in ground rules, but ideally, this will comprise a process rather than an ad hoc solution. Requirements management is defined in the project management plan, in the scope management subsidiary plan. Environment and culture expertise is most useful when informing ground rules related to the tone or content of communication rather than the communication channel itself.

Callie, the project manager at Sharp Logistics, is considering the marketplace regarding how it may affect pricing on the procured portion of her project. In her market, Callie concludes there is only a single-source seller. What is meant by a single-source seller?
Only one seller is qualified.
There is one seller who can provide all conditions of the project procurement needs.
Correct answer
The company wants to do business with only one seller.
The market consists of only one seller.
Overall explanation
The correct response is a single-seller means that the company wants to do business with only one seller. Even though multiple sellers may satisfy a project’s needs, only one can be used. One seller in the market does not mean that the seller can adequately and fully satisfy the project’s needs; therefore, this response is incorrect. This response describes a sole-source seller and is incorrect.

Jonathon is a scrum master for Project Wilds, which is two iterations into its deployment. Jonathon has identified several stakeholders who are not interested in how the project is progressing and do not seem to have much influence on the project itself. How should Jonathon manage these stakeholders?
Invite them to daily stand-up.
Correct answer
Regularly check-in to see how they are doing.
Ensure they receive regular project updates.
Ignore them. Given the low power and influence, these stakeholders cannot impact Project W.
Overall explanation
Low power and low influence stakeholders should be monitored, but unless they express additional interest do not need to be closely tied to the project. Regular stand-up meetings are not something that stakeholders should be included in because these meetings are for the project team to coordinate work. Ignoring stakeholders invites risks that will impact the project and should not be done. Since these stakeholders have little interest in the project, regular updates will likely be ignored.

Lizzy is the project manager for Project Westward, three weeks into a planned ten-week implementation and has a CPI of .99. This project has several requirements for a federal agency that influence the project timeline. The requirements call for inspectors to review the work before a customer uses the solution. These reviews do not take long to complete, but it often takes two weeks or longer for the inspector to arrive and complete the review process. After a recent team meeting, a developer approached Lizzy and asked why compliance is so important. What is Lizzy's most likely response?
To mitigate risk issues with the financial concerns of the project.
The program management office requires it.
Correct answer
To meet legal obligations.
To promote customer safety.
Overall explanation
Compliance means aligning with rules, regulations, and laws – these are legal obligations for different types of projects. Compliance reviews may take time, but they counteract the cost of failing to meet compliance, codes, laws, and other legal issues. The project management office may require it, but the best reason is to meet a legal obligation. Compliance may promote customer safety, but the best answer is that the project is legally obligated to meet the compliance requirements. Compliance could be a risk mitigation issue, but the best answer is to meet legal obligations for the project.

You are a project manager for a project team within an organization that has a weak matrix environment. The project team members do not report directly to you. You cannot directly reward performance based on the project's key performance indicators, which shows that the project has fallen one week behind schedule. What is the most appropriate use of the power you should implement as a project manager?
Reward 
Correct answer
Formal power 
Referent 
Expert 
Overall explanation
In a weak matrix, the project manager has little authority over the team and formal power is the most likely type of power to be exerted. Expert power is when the project manager is steeped in experience and this question gives little hint that this is the case. Reward power is not the best choice as the project manager cannot reward the project team. Referent power is when the project manager refers to someone else's authority, such as the CIO. This type of power can also mean that the team already has a relationship with the project manager.

Finish-to-start relationship
Correct answer
Lag
Soft logic
Lead
Overall explanation
The correct answer is lag, defined as the time between activities. The primer needs to cure for 24 hours before the activity of painting can begin. Soft logic is incorrect because it describes the scheduling of activities based on preferences, guidelines, or external conditions. Even though this scenario describes a finish-to-start situation, this answer is incorrect because lag is a better choice due to the added wait time.

Wilma is the project manager for Project EDF, ten weeks into implementation, $12,500 under budget, and two weeks behind schedule. Part of the project's delay was due to some intense planning workshops to create an in-depth WBS. Recently Project EDF's team identified several unplanned tasks required to bring Project EDF back into its planned budget. What should Wilma do with this information?
Correct answer
Send the new tasks to the change control board.
Ask the product owner to prioritize the new tasks.
Reject the new tasks because being under budget is always a good thing.
Have the team write up requirements documents for the new tasks.
Overall explanation
Wilma should forward the new tasks to the change control board to ensure they do not negatively impact Project EDF. Predictive projects do not have a product owner. You know this is a predictive project with the clue of creating an in-depth WBS, something agile projects do not have. Having documented requirements will not help unless the change control board has not approved the tasks. Rejecting the tasks is not ideal as they may be necessary for Project EDF to succeed.

Elma has more than one contact who can most likely generate better price quotes for these materials. Still, she does not want to micromanage the project team member on their responsibilities. What should Elma do?
Remove or reassign the buyer to someone who can follow directions.
Let the buyer develop her network just as Elma has done over the years.
Correct answer
Make introductions for the buyer and her contact to get the best quote possible.
Take the best quote presented as this was the responsibility of the team member.
Overall explanation
It is not prudent to sit on a lead that could reduce the cost of a project. Elma should be upfront with her buyer and let the individual know that the quotes she is getting can be beaten. Elma can show the buyer her negotiating skills and potentially link the buyer to her valuable contacts, which could be a win-win for the project, Elma, and the team members. Yes, the buyer should develop her network just as Elma has done over the years, but Elma can make introductions and mentor the buyer. Taking the best quote presented is not the best choice as Elma has a duty to ensure a fair and equitable quote for the project. To remove or reassign the buyer to someone who can follow directions is not a valid answer as the buyer has not been given specific directions that she has not followed.

As a project manager of a new recycling plant, you will be establishing safekeeping guidelines for hazardous materials that require specific storage environments. This project needs local government approvals and a physical inspection of the plant. You have done your research and determined that it would take at least four weeks to obtain authorization for such approval because of the inspections and coordination involved in the process. This requirement is a negative risk to the performance of the project's schedule. You would like to send the requirements ahead of time to reduce the timelines' impact. Which risk response are you exercising in this scenario?
Correct answer
Mitigate risk
Transfer risk
Accept risk
Avoid risk
Overall explanation
In this case, you are condensing the approval time by starting the authorization process early to avoid delays in the project. Risk mitigation is the correct answer. Transferring risk is hiring a third party to accept the risk through insurance. Avoiding risks is taking all possible actions to remove the risk, which is not possible for this scenario.

The customers of Hamad's latest project have asked for additions to the project scope. Being the project manager, Hamad notifies the customers that additional risk planning needs to be added to the project schedule. Why is this so?
Correct answer
Whenever the scope is adjusted, risk planning must always occur.
Risk planning must always take the same amount of time as the scope change's required activities.
Hamad is incorrect. Risk planning does not need to occur every time there is a project change.
Only at the project manager's discretion should risk planning occur.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is risk planning should always occur when the scope is adjusted. To analyze additional risks to the project's success, the project manager should require risk planning when the scope has been changed. Risk planning should not occur at the project manager's discretion, and therefore this response is incorrect. Risk planning should be based on project evidence and the policies adopted in the risk management plan. This response is incorrect because risk planning should occur when changes are added to the project scope.

Victor is the project manager for a medium-sized insurance company. The current project to upgrade their user interface to enhance the customer experience is going well, and the stakeholders are happy with the progress so far. Experience has taught Victor that every project offers several learning opportunities to generate knowledge and increase individual competencies and organizational assets. This includes both tacit and explicit knowledge. Out of the options below, which definition correctly explains tactic knowledge?
Correct answer
Tacit knowledge is based on personal beliefs, values, and knowledge gained from experience.
Lessons learned are an example of tacit knowledge.
Tacit knowledge can be quickly and easily expressed through conversations, documentation, figures, or numbers.
Tacit knowledge may need explanation or context to provide value to recipients of this information.
Overall explanation
Tacit knowledge is more difficult to express because it is based on personal beliefs, values, knowledge gained from experience, and "know-how" when doing a task. Tacit knowledge includes emotions, experience, and ability. Trust is a requirement of sharing this type of knowledge within the team or organization.

Whenever there is a skills gap, mentoring and training are almost always the best choice as we want people to become better at what they do and add long-term value to the organization. Mentoring and training is the best choice, not replacing Jon. Co-sponsorship of a project is rarely an accurate choice or effective management approach. Jon really needs to go through training or mentorship in the organization. There will be risks if the project sponsor does not understand their roles and responsibilities, but this is not the best choice for what Bailey should do next.

Adam is assigned to manage a medium-sized project to design and develop a new tool used in an automobile service shop. The cost was initially determined as the highest constraint on the project. The project faced significant difficulties in the tool's quality during execution, prompting management to state quality as the most important project constraint at this point. If another problem with quality occurs in the current situation, what would be the best thing for Adam to do?
Allow risk to increase by cutting costs.
Correct answer
Fix the problem as soon as possible.
Allowing the cost to increase will solve the problem's root cause.
Cut costs, which will allow the schedule to slip.
Overall explanation
If a problem with quality occurs again, it is proactive for the project manager to fix the problem as soon as possible. Other project constraints must also adjust, accommodating a fix to the root cause of the situation. Allowing risks to increase is not a good choice. It is acceptable to allow some risks to exist in the project if there is a balance in the risk probability and impact. Not all risks will increase simply by cutting costs, so this is not a valid choice. Allowing costs to increase likely will not address the root cause of the problem, so this choice is incorrect. Cutting costs may, or may not, cause the schedule to slip from its baseline. There is some reasoning that slow and perfect is needed in some quality constraints, such as in healthcare, but this scenario does not imply that requirement, so this choice is incorrect.

Leah is working on a project in SpaceTek International, Ltd. as an agile practitioner. The agile team has just finished the first iteration, and during the retrospective meeting, the lessons learned documentation is being created with recommendations to improve the future iterations' performance. Which of the following should the team not include in the lessons learned documentation?
Improvements to be enacted during the next iteration.
The rationale behind choosing a corrective action
Correct answer
Only successes to identify best practices to apply to future iterations
Cause of variances
Overall explanation
Note that the question asks which of the mentioned options will not be part of lessons learned documentation. Although it is equally important to capture the successes throughout a project as these can identify best practices to apply to future projects and processes, documenting only the success is not enough. One of the primary objectives of conducting a retrospective is to allow the agile team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration. Therefore, the lessons learned document also includes documenting the causes of issues, reasoning behind the chosen corrective action, and other lessons learned about people, relationships, processes, and tools. Identifying a project issue is not enough. Understanding where the issue originated and its impact gives more context to the issue and helps set up recommendations for improvements moving forward. The lessons learned document spells out both what worked well and what did not. It is focused on what the team would do if they had the project to do over again, knowing what they know now.

Project YB is $10,000 over budget and one week behind schedule in its second month of implementation. After a recent team meeting, Damon, the project manager, was approached by a team member who complained about one team member not following the team's group rules. What should Damon do next?
Escalate the issue to the steering committee.
Do nothing. The team will manage themselves.
Remove the offending team member from the project.
Correct answer
Encourage that team member to raise this topic at the next team meeting.
Overall explanation
To help encourage adherence to the ground rules, Damon should encourage the team member to raise this topic at their next meeting. This will help to build a discussion around the importance of the rules. When ground rules are created and agreed upon, it is the responsibility of everyone, not just the project manager, to enforce the rules. Removing the offending team member is not ideal as it will not strengthen the team. Escalating the issue to the steering committee is not a good choice.Doing nothing risks the situation escalating further and creating more significant issues.

Your development team holds their sprint review meeting with the stakeholders and demonstrates the product increment for release. During this ceremony, one of the influential stakeholders disagreed with the team and insisted on adding more product features before moving to the next iteration. As an agile manager, what is your advice to the stakeholder?
Correct answer
Adding features can be costly and not add benefit to the increment without revisiting the backlog.
Ask the product owner to convince the stakeholder that there is no need for changes.
Ask the stakeholder to submit a formal request.
Advise the stakeholder that change is not accepted as the Definition of Done and finalized.
Overall explanation
It is up to the development team to establish sprint goals. Changes to the product are fine, but they must be added to the product backlog and prioritized by the product owner, not in the current iteration. Formal requests or fixed scope of work are not in line with agile values. Changes are welcome, but changes must follow the rules of agile. The product owner may collect the priority, but the development team will ultimately prioritize the sprint backlog.

While running these tests, the technician finds a defect in the diagnostics display. The technician informs Ace and submits a change request to repair the defect, indicating the repair will require substantial rework. What should Ace's first course of action be?
Direct the project team to repair the defect.
Approve the change request.
Correct answer
Review the change management plan.
Reject the change request due to time constraints.
Overall explanation
Ace should review the change management plan to see who is responsible for reviewing and making decisions on change requests. The project manager may or may not have the authority to approve or reject the change request. The change management plan will guide the change control process and outline the key decision maker's roles and responsibilities.

Paul’s team has twelve user stories currently in progress. His team typically averages eight user stories in progress, but two of their team members are out on vacation. The most likely effect on the project is that
The throughput has increased
Correct answer
The cycle time has increased, and throughput has decreased
The cycle time has decreased
The throughput has decreased
Overall explanation
The cycle time has increased because the WIP has increased. Cycle time is WIP/throughput. WIP in this scenario has increased to twelve. Throughput is the average number of stories per cycle, which is likely to go down with team members out. There is a larger number in the numerator than before and a smaller denominator than before, resulting in a larger number. The best answer is that both cycle time and throughput decrease. With a larger numerator and smaller denominator, cycle time cannot be decreased. Throughput is the average number of stories per cycle, which would be expected to be lower with resources out.

Raj is the project manager for Sleeps Good, a large manufacturer of luxury bed pillows. His latest project, Silky Sleep, involves creating and manufacturing a new pillow for high-end hotels. Raj has decided to use JIT (just-in-time) for the project's scheduling. Of the following, which is an advantage of using JIT?
Readily available materials are a requirement.
Compared to other inventory solutions, it allows for a broad range of deviation.
Correct answer
The inventory investment is decreased.
It gives the project team control over materials.
Overall explanation
An advantage of JIT scheduling is that the investment in inventory is decreased. However, if a mistake is made with no additional materials on hand, downtime may occur. JIT does not allow for a broad range of deviation; therefore, this response is incorrect. This response is incorrect because the project team must be careful not to waste materials. Materials are only available when they are needed; therefore, this response is incorrect.

He and the team have reviewed the risk event and communicated the plan to the key stakeholders. David noticed one member of his project team de-escalating a heated conversation about the risk with a stakeholder by following the ground rules the team set up. What should David do next?
Focus on mitigating the scheduling risk.
Make a note in the team members' file about the incident.
Correct answer
Praise the team member at the next project meeting.
Privately follow up with the stakeholder to learn about what happened.
Overall explanation
David should publicly reinforce the team member following agreed-upon behaviors and rules. This will encourage other members of the team to do the same. The risk event has a mitigation plan already, so there is additional planning needed and this choice will not improve upon how the team members support one another. Privately following up with the stakeholder will not improve how the team supports each other. Adding a note to the employee's file will not encourage others to model this behavior.

The developer is having a hard time learning GIT. What is the best choice for addressing this problem?
Have the developer sit down with the enterprise architect for your company to discuss resources for learning GIT and the company's application development standards.

Ask management to send the developer to a training course to learn GIT.
Inform the developer that he will GIT over it and learn the new version control.
Overall explanation
Talk to the developer and determine what he wants to do to avoid the new programming version control. The best choice is to find out from the developer what he would like to do to learn the new GIT version control. This answer does not address the issue and can be rude to the team member.

During a recent meeting with multiple stakeholders, Deborah referred to previous projects she had worked on that were successful and how information from those projects will help her in this project. What is the most likely reason Deborah is sharing this information?
Correct answer
To influence the stakeholders with her expertise.
She does not think the stakeholders will take her seriously.
To make herself feel important in front of the key stakeholders.
Her project management office told her to do so.
Overall explanation
By telling stories of successful projects, she has worked on, Deborah is attempting to influence her stakeholders. Without being boastful or arrogant, recollections and comparisons to similar projects can put the stakeholders at ease by showing that the project manager has experience with similar important or high-profile projects. Deborah is not sharing this information to feel important but to set the stakeholders at ease. There is no evidence that she does not think the stakeholders take her seriously.

As part of being the senior project manager, you are often called on to determine which project the organization should invest in and why. Your project management office has sent you a portfolio containing four projects that have not yet begun. Today, the project management office has asked that you manage the project with the highest current value of future cash flows. Which project will you select?
The project with the highest present value (PV)
Correct answer
The project with the highest net present value (NPV)
The project with the highest internal rate of return (IRR)
The project with the highest benefit-cost ratio
Overall explanation
The current value of future cash flows is the net present value (NPV). Therefore, you should select the project with the highest NPV. The project with the highest present value, PV, does not account for the value of future cash flows, as the question states. The internal rate of return has nothing to do with the current value of future cash flows. The benefit-cost ratio has nothing to do with the current value of future cash flows.

A project manager plans the budget for a project that was put on hold for four months last year due to changing organizational priorities. Now management wishes to re-start the project with a revised objective. Of the following listed costs, which should the project manager not include while preparing the budget for completing the project?
Direct Costs
Variable Costs
Correct answer
Sunk Costs
Fixed Costs
Overall explanation
Sunk costs are expended costs and refer to money that has already been spent and cannot be recovered. Subsequent to the rule that sunk costs should not be considered when deciding whether to continue with a project that is in trouble. The reason is that the cost will remain the same regardless of the outcome of a decision, and they are seen as irrelevant to current and future budgetary concerns. A fixed cost is a cost that does not change with an increase or decrease in the amount of goods or services produced or sold. A variable cost is a corporate expense that changes in proportion to production output. Variable costs increase or decrease depending on a company's production volume; they rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. A direct cost is a price that can be directly tied to the production of specific goods or services.

There is a general trend whereby materials become more expensive as the year goes on and other companies begin their projects. As a result, Rett's project is front-loaded. The stakeholders push for accurate, specific requirements for the needed materials during the planning phase, with procurement to occur almost as soon as the project starts. Which project management approach is most appropriate?
Correct answer
Predictive
Agile
Iterative
Incremental
Overall explanation
The predictive project management approach is based on the specification of requirements and substantial planning during the beginning phases of a project. Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project's life cycle. This option is not optimal for projects that are front-loaded. Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time. This option is not optimal for projects that are front-loaded. Agile project life cycles continuously elaborate their requirements based on feedback obtained following a sprint to add a feature or group of features to a product. This option is not optimal for projects that are front-loaded.

At a recent team meeting, his project manager was reviewing risk triggers. Eric is unfamiliar with this concept. What is the project manager's most likely response when asked?
Correct answer
Risk triggers are the warning signs a risk will become an issue.
Risk triggers are what cause the steering committee to act.
Risk triggers are what make positive risks happen.
The project management office mandates risk triggers.
Overall explanation
Risk triggers are the precursors to risks becoming an issue. They are important to examine to prepare the team for an upcoming risk. Triggers are warning signs for the likelihood of a risk event occurring. Risk triggers do not make positive risks happen; they are signals that an event, positive or negative, may happen, and the risk response is needed.

Beth learns that Devin, a team leader for the infrastructure portion of the project, has been having outbursts towards his project team if they do not do exactly as he asks. For this reason, team members are reluctant to provide their inputs when they are assigned to Devin's team. What should Beth recommend in this scenario?
Correct answer
Coach Devin to better manage emotions by asking the question, "What are we going to do?".
Require Devin to complete an anger management course.
Request for team members that have higher emotional intelligence (EI) to handle his outbursts.
Coach Devin to avoid his team members until he has calmed down.
Overall explanation
Beth should coach Devin to manage emotions better and show trust and transparency to his team. By asking "what are we going to do" rather than making demands and having outbursts, he works with the team rather than over the team. An anger management course may be beneficial, but it is not an immediate solution to address the problem in the scenario. Avoidance of the team is not a practical solution and does not foster teamwork rather than the command-and-control attitude that Devin presents in the scenario. It is not fair for the team to tolerate Devin's behavior and it is not practical for only a few people who may have higher emotional intelligence to manage the outbursts.

Overall explanation
Agile projects do not utilize weekly status reports like predictive projects do. With a new approach to projects, the stakeholders may not realize how the project and communications differ from a predictive project. Inviting the stakeholder to daily standups is not the best choice presented. Hank should apologize but then coach the stakeholder on the information radiator he can view at any time.

Due to a compressed timeline and several new feature requests, two more teams are folded into his so that his team effectively triples in size. In addition to reporting to Carlos, the new team members will continue to report to their original supervisors. Almost all the team's new members are based in different countries, and the time difference between some team members can be as much as eight hours. The team members record video introductions and share them with the group. Everyone is looking forward to working hard over the next few months. But one week later, Alex, one of the developers who recently joined Carlos' team, sends an angry email to the group explaining that he has been scheduled to review the latest user interface on the day they have to take their child to the dentist. Alex is especially frustrated because he clearly marked this day as unavailable on the group's calendar.

Alex makes it clear that their family is his priority, and someone else will have to review the user interface. In what stage of the project is this conflict occurring?
Forming
Norming
Performing
Correct answer
Storming
Overall explanation
This is the storming stage of the project, which is characterized by open conflict on the team. After the video introductions, which constituted the forming stage, the team encountered an open conflict caused by a disagreement about who would be responsible for a task. The forming stage includes orientation and acquaintanceship with team members. The norming stage results in leader's and team member's roles being firmly established.

The project team drafts the charter, and the project manager approves it.
A corporate executive drafts the charter, and the functional manager approves it.
The project sponsor drafts the charter, and the project manager approves it.

The project manager usually drafts the charter, but the project manager approves the charter. This action allows the project manager to proceed with the project. The project team does not draft the charter, and the project manager is not the person who approves it. A corporate executive drafting the charter and the functional manager approving it is not the best choice as the project manager often writes the project charter.

You are the project manager for your organization, and you have told management that you will be using the critical chain path for this project. Management is unaware of this approach, and they want to know more about it. What is the critical path method?
It finds the longest path to project completion and allows float on the other activities in the project.
It utilizes just-in-time ordering.
It is a project network diagram with the project float exposed.
Correct answer
It is a schedule network analysis that accounts for limited resources.
Overall explanation
The critical chain approach to scheduling is different than the critical path approach. Critical chain considers the availability of resources when scheduling the flow of the project work. Critical chain also uses buffers of time, rather than float, to determine the project’s early finish date. Just-in-time ordering is a supply chain and logistic approach to manage the amount of materials at the project job site. This approach is not applicable to this scenario. The critical path method finds the critical path, which is the longest path to project completion and determines the amount of float that can be applied to the project's other, noncritical, path activities. This is the critical path method, but it does not define the critical path method as completely as choice C.

Accept the additional work since Project X is ahead of schedule.
Correct answer
Accept the additional work and coordinate the effort with the product owner.
Immediately reject the additional work as this is against Project X's ground rules.
Overall explanation
Scrum is an agile project management approach that welcomes changes. The change should be coordinated with the product owner. The product owner will prioritize the change in the product backlog for implementation. The work should not be accepted simply because of the project schedule. The team does not decide if the work should be added to the project. The work will go to the product owner, who will prioritize the work as needed in the product backlog.

The time difference is especially acute for the analysts since they all live in roughly the same geographic location and prefer to work standard business hours. Which benefit can a virtual team provide?
Special expertise from geographically distant team members
Including team members with mobility limitations or disabilities
Incorporating employees who work from home offices
Correct answer
Broad coverage of multiple time zones
Overall explanation
In this scenario, the broad coverage of multiple time zones is a key benefit of virtual teams that are distributed across the world. When one team is going to sleep, another can take over its activities, which creates a regular cadence of delivery and feedback and creates challenges when trying to get the entire team to meet. Special expertise from geographically distant team members is a distinct benefit of virtual teams, especially since employees with certain skill sets can sometimes cluster around certain locations and not others. Including team members with mobility limitations or disabilities using virtual teams allows companies to accommodate all their employees while providing opportunities for their teams to benefit from their work. Virtual teams do incorporate employees who work from home offices, but these benefits alone are not sufficient to address the need for round-the-clock monitoring of a process.

You are the project manager of the HNN Project. Your team needs safety training to install several of the components in your project. The cost of this training is known as which one of the following?
Team development
Correct answer
Cost of quality
Variable costs
Cost of nonconformance
Overall explanation
The cost of training is considered a cost of quality. Training is one method of team development, but the cost of training is not. The cost of nonconformance to quality is the cost that will occur if the quality is not obtained. Variable costs is incorrect because variable costs describe costs that fluctuate within a project.

Walter is the project manager of a new software product development project. A beta version of the product was released to gain more insight into the acceptability and issues. The beta test was performed with a small sample of users. The beta testing identified the following defects due to various reasons such as operating system incompatibility (10 percent), difficulty to comprehend instruction manuals (19 percent), non-availability of desired features (25 percent), design gaps (15 percent), and browser incompatibility (18 percent). Which of the following tools could Walter use to illustrate the causes of these problems?
Quality checklists
Correct answer
Histogram
Scatter diagram
Flowchart
Overall explanation
A histogram is a bar graph illustrating the frequency of an event occurring using the bar's height as an indicator. It is used to show the frequency of distributions or how often a value occurs in a data set. Each column represents an attribute or characteristic of a problem or situation. This tool helps illustrate the most common cause of the issues in a process by the number and relative heights of the bars. Therefore, a histogram would be the best tool used by the project manager in the current scenario. Quality checklists are used to ensure that a repeated set of work is being performed the same way each time, not something applicable to this scenario. A scatter diagram is used to visualize the relationship (co-relation) between the two variables. Project managers can understand the sequence of events by utilizing flow charts to visualize the relationships and dependencies between events.

Jackie is working with a team of engineers, financiers, and developers to complete the project plan for a new condominium. The planning sessions are expected to take several months, and each team will drive the planning sessions for specific months. For instance, the financiers will largely control the planning in earlier months as money is raised for the project. The developers will take over once the funding is secured. The engineers will take over when the building permits clear. Jackie prefers to plan in this fashion to avoid any blockers. Which project life cycle is appropriate?
Incremental
Predictive
Correct answer
Iterative
Agile
Overall explanation
Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project's life cycle. Because planning is triggered each time each team receives deliverables from the project manager, an iterative project management life cycle is appropriate. Predictive project life cycles are based on the specification of requirements and substantial planning during the beginning phases of a project. Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time. Agile project life cycles continuously elaborate their requirements based on feedback obtained following a sprint to add a feature or group of features to a product.

You are the project manager for your organization. Your project is to develop a business case to construct a car park near a major stadium in the central business district. This project has been progressing for just two weeks and the team is arguing over who will do what task, who is in charge of certain decisions, and who reports to whom. The team is only interested in performing tasks they feel comfortable with. For example, only one of your team members is familiar with costing techniques and is thus assigned to perform that portion of the business case. The other team members let the team member perform that function but do not care to learn about those techniques themselves. Which of Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a team best describes the scenario above?
Correct answer
Lack of commitment
Absence of trust
Fear of conflict
Avoidance of accountability
Overall explanation
The team is moving through the storming phase of the project and they are staking out their areas of the project. In this instance, the lack of clarity or buy-in prevents team members from making decisions they will stick to. People give up or check out because of either artificial harmony at one extreme or destructive harmony at the other extreme, leading to either fear or fantasy. If the team members cannot share their past experiences and present thoughts, they will not trust each other enough to honestly discuss future goals for the team, which is not the case in this scenario. The fear of being vulnerable to team members prevents the building of trust within the team. Such things characterize vulnerability-based trust as saying, 'I need help,' 'I screwed up,' or 'I made an error.' Fear of conflict is not demonstrated in this scenario. It is only in rare situations where struggling to accomplish assigned tasks would involve conflict with other people. Avoidance of accountability rather consists of low standards and not questioning peer decisions.

She must also ensure that it can be integrated seamlessly with the organization's other major applications already in use. Of the following choices, which best describes this situation?
The project scope
Correct answer
A constraint
An expectation
An assumption
Overall explanation
The correct answer is constraints. Constraints are limits to keep a project's available options small. An expectation is not a valid project management component and can often be described as an assumption, as an expectation may not be verbalized, documented, or agreed upon. An assumption is something that is believed to be true, but is not proven to be true. In this scenario, there may be an assumption the software will work with other software, but the project manager has not tested or verified the assumption. Project scope is defined as all of the required work, and only the required work, to meet the project objectives.

By comparing key performance indicators, Cynthia will be able to determine if performance has changed or not. Asking the team is not the best choice as the team has already identified how they can improve upon their project. Asking the product owner for feedback is good practice, but this does not answer the question for team improvement.

The risk response is to pause some of the other parallel activities and take additional steps to fix the problem. The risk will cause three weeks of project delays and nearly $15,000 in additional costs. What type of risk response has been utilized?
Correct answer
Mitigation
Fast-tracking
Escalation
Transference
Overall explanation
This is a mitigation response. Mitigations are actions used to reduce the probability and/or impact of the risk event. The mitigation did cost the project time and money, but there's no indication of the effect of not mitigating the project. Transference means the project is transferred to a third party, such as a contractor. Fast-tracking is a schedule compression technique to allow activities or phases to run in parallel. Escalation is when the risk is outside of the project manager's authority and is escalated to management.

Ben does not want the team to move the project off course when it is still early in the process.
Ben wants to explain the rules, go back to his regular job duties, and let the team work independently.
Correct answer
When starting a project, it is a good idea to follow a method that has already been tested, proven, and refined by others.
Ben wants the team to show him that they can follow the rules.
Overall explanation
In order to begin a project, many different theories have been tried and tested by agile teams. Following the rules that have been previously tested, proven, and refined will get the team to the project basics. Agile teams have found that before you understand how and why all the pieces work together, a high level of understanding should be developed. The other responses are incorrect. Following the rules at the beginning of a project will keep it on course to avoid scope creep. So that there is no conflict between jobs, agile leaders need to be fully committed to the project. While it is acceptable to change the agile rules, it should only be done after the team has mastered them and has valid reasons for the change.

Overall explanation
Shane should capitalize on the CPA's financial services strengths to improve the rest of the team by facilitating workshops. Workshops can be used to determine functional requirements and allow key stakeholders to formulate user stories. Shane should not be using a laissez-faire approach, which can result in a lack of confidence in his leadership abilities.

Jack informs Charles that as the project manager, he will be expected to participate in contract negotiations. Charles asks why this is the case when the firm has a centralized procurement office. What should Jack's response be?
The project manager always has authority over the contract terms.
The project manager should be present only to introduce the seller to the staff in the procurement office.
The project manager should set the price of a contract.
Correct answer
The project manager should protect the relationship with the seller.
Overall explanation
The project manager should participate in the negotiation stage of a contract to protect the relationship with the seller. The contract must be beneficial for the buyer and the seller to protect the project's quality and the relationship between the seller and the buyer. The project manager rarely has authority over the contract terms but can influence the terms of the contract. The project manager cannot set a contract's price. Price is one of the key elements that is often negotiated. The buyer and seller should work together to set a price that is equitable for both parties. The project manager will likely connect the seller to the procurement office, but the project manager's role should be much more vital than this. The project manager should work in the negotiation stage to maintain a beneficial relationship between the buyer and seller.

It is not appropriate to compare velocities between teams. Velocity calculation is team-specific and unique to that team. One team's story point may or may not hold the same value as a story point for another team. It would be best to ignore the difference. Requesting additional resources to get more work done is not valid as there is no evidence that Benny's team is falling behind schedule or not performing as expected. Performing an affinity estimation is not a valid agile project management choice, so this choice is incorrect. Working longer hours is not a recommended option.

The product owner pushes back and asks why Penny wants to take project time to do this. What is Penny's most likely response?
Penny thinks the project may fail and wants to ensure quality.
Agree with the product owner and remove the checks.
Correct answer
The team has reported some issues with the new code and prior work in the project.
The project team needs to fill their schedules as they are nearing project completion.
Overall explanation
When there are issues in an agile project that stem from prior coding or work in the project, it is prudent to review the prior work for accuracy. This can be done through testing and a manual review of the work. Filling up someone's schedule is not a good reason to add work to the project. Thinking the project may fail is not a good answer; fear and doubt are never good reasons to implement additional work. Agreeing with the product owner robs the project of the chance of catching poor quality deliverables. It is always a good idea to keep mistakes out of the customers' hands, which is the point of quality control.

Because most people have Internet access, immediate communication is possible.
Alice’s involvement as the team leader will be minimal because agile teams can run themselves.
With the project goals in mind, using the agile method allows Alice to choose two or three team members per location to work together.
Correct answer
To ensure the progression of the project, agile teams complete tasks and receive feedback using short iterations.
Overall explanation
Continuous coordination and collaboration are required for short iterations during an agile project.Think of each iteration as a mini-project, with chunks of work easier to manage than a whole project at the end of its life cycle. An iteration is complete when delivered. There is no requirement that virtual teams must work in groups of two or three.

Overall explanation
In the mentioned scenario, evaluating the impact of the change on the schedule has already been done. However, that is not enough. The change could impact scope, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction. Therefore, the other impacts of the project should be evaluated first. Reaching out to the sponsor for permission without doing integrated change control is not the best move for a Project manager. Asking the team to implement the change immediately without the impact assessment is never recommended. Once the additional impacts have been evaluated, they can approve or deny the change if a change control board exists.

A team that accepts assignments approved for them by their departmental manager and ensures that they are distributed evenly among team members.
A team hiring only individuals who pass a detailed examination related to how they organize their incoming work and personal activities.
Overall explanation
A self-organizing team is relatively autonomous regarding major decisions related to software development. The distance between team members has no bearing on a team's choice to be self-organizing.

Alex is a scrum master with Title Corporation, which recently deployed a new product prototype for testing. Midway through testing, it was discovered that several significant components do not meet compliance requirements for fault tolerance. What should Alex do about these defects?
Report the failure to the steering committee
Correct answer
Determine what additional tests this prototype can be used for in the project.
Scrap the prototypes immediately and start again.
Reprimand the engineers for not following compliance requirements.
Overall explanation
Before scrapping this prototype, Alex should determine what additional tests may be conducted with it, and this will allow him to maximize its usefulness to Title Corporation. Immediately scrapping the prototype risks losing valuable information on other tests. Reporting the failure without maximizing the prototype's usefulness is non-ideal. Reprimanding the team is not ideal as prototypes typically fail various tests.

Nakaphan is doing consumer research on several neighborhoods to ascertain whether they would be a good candidate for a fast-food franchise. If the analysis proves favorable, the organization will launch a project that Nakaphan will likely lead. The fast-food franchise is a middle-tier one whose target customer is health-conscious and is identified as a middle-income class. As Nakaphan is conducting his research, a lower-priced competitor moves into all the neighborhoods. Unfortunately, all the market research suggests that consumers will compete on price for the type of food offered by Nakaphan's franchise, so he is effectively locked out of the market, and he does not think the organization should move forward with the project. Which artifact is being managed?
Correct answer
Business case
Project charter
Requirements
Customer/stakeholder analysis
Overall explanation
The business case is the compelling reason for the project's existence, and closely managing it is critical since any changes are likely to affect all aspects of the project. However, it does not provide information to the project manager on project-related activities. The project charter establishes the relationship between the project team and the organization, and includes the project purpose, stakeholders, and project team members, and authorizes organizational resources to be used for the project. If the project environment changes, the project manager should review the project charter for further information. Managing requirements is a continuous process starting with the initial requirement-gathering session and continuing until the project's close. Customer or stakeholder analysis is a dynamic process performed throughout the project that must be managed when additional stakeholders join the project.

Matthew is a project manager for the construction of a new conference building. Three weeks before the completion date, a massive fire engulfs a significant section of the build and causes an unknown amount of damage that will require an additional month to repair. Matthew has been tasked with conducting emergency repairs to minimize profits lost from missing the deadline. Which of the following contract types would be most appropriate in this scenario?
Firm fixed price (FFP)
Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA)
Correct answer
Cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF)
Time and material contracts (T&M)
Overall explanation
A Cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF)contract would be the most preferable in this scenario. This contract reimburses the contractor for all allowable costs and receives a fixed-fee payment calculated as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs. Fee amounts do not change unless the project scope changes. As the work scope is currently unknown based on damages, a cost-reimbursable contract is better suited to this kind of work. A firm fixed price (FFP) contract is where the price is fixed and not changed unless the scope of work changes. A firm fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA) is a fixed-price contract, but with a special provision allowing for predefined final adjustments to the contract price due to changed conditions, such as inflation or raw material costs increasing or decreasing. A time and materials (T&M) contract is a mixture of a cost-plus contract and a fixed price contract.

You are the project manager of a large, complex technology project. Your project team has been working on this project for six months in an agile project. Some of the team members have become frustrated with other team members not performing at the same level. Which sprint ceremony would provide a good opportunity to discuss their frustrations?
Sprint planning
Sprint review
Sprint boxing
Correct answer
Sprint retrospective
Overall explanation
The sprint retrospective is an opportunity to discuss what has, or has not, been working well in the team. While this meeting is not an opportunity to cast blame, it does provide an opportunity for team members to discuss issues in the project. The sprint review is a demonstration of what the development team has created and does not provide an opportunity to discuss issues with the team's performance. Sprint planning happens at the launch of each sprint and the development team determines how many users stories from the product backlog they can accomplish during the sprint. Sprint boxing sounds like fun, but it is not a valid agile project management term.

You are the project manager for your organization and you have just started a software development project using an agile approach. This project will create a phone app that allows users to purchase additional benefits and bonuses in the software through their phone. Rodrigo, a senior member of the PMO, has asked you to send him a list of all legal requirements you must comply with for your project. Which of the following would be included in this list?
Updates to the risk register should be submitted before noon on Thursdays.
The project sponsor and COO must sign a project charter.
Correct answer
The app must follow the payment processor security requirements.
The project will receive a bonus if the app is completed early.
Overall explanation
The only legal requirement is that the application must follow whatever security requirements the payment processor requires. Updates to the risk register are a project requirement, not a legal requirement. The project sponsor and the COO signing the project charter, which should have already happened, is an organizational requirement. Receiving a bonus is a great thing, but the organization is not legally required to do so.

You are a project manager of a rehabilitation project designed to restore contaminated soil on a previously occupied property located next to a bus terminal repair shop. As part of your ground excavation permit, you need to evaluate health and safety risks and provide risk mitigation and response plans for your permit to be reviewed by the city. What will you do with the health and safety evaluation once your permit is approved?
Send the document to your sponsors.
Archive the document the information as confidential in the knowledge database.
Correct answer
Make documents available to the project team, contractors, and those performing work.
Circulate the document to the neighboring properties.
Overall explanation
Health and safety documents become part of your project's governance and requirements and will need to be shared and communicated with your project team following the permit's conditions. There is an expectation to ensure health and safety requirements are made transparent to team members, and an escalation path is made available for all emergencies. Archiving the documents as confidential will prevent the health and safety evaluation from being easily accessed. Sending the document to the project sponsors is not the best answer to this question. Circulating the document to the neighboring properties is not an appropriate answer to this question.

Executing is the correct answer, and managing quality is normally a process of execution. QA is typically not an inspection process, so therefore this response is incorrect. An audit is too general of an answer for this scenario and is therefore incorrect. Audits may be driven by financial, scheduling, or quality reasons.

Meet with Amy and ask her how the project manager can help her feel more engaged with the project.
Correct answer
Meet with Amy and update her about the project's status and progress so far.
Ask Amy's supervisor to talk to her about the importance of being engaged in the project.
Continue to send Amy the project reports throughout the project and ask that she read them.
Overall explanation
The project manager should meet privately with Amy to assess her engagement and discuss potential solutions for making her more engaged. It could be possible that the information and reports that Amy is currently getting are not sufficient for keeping her engaged. Continuing to send Amy the project reports throughout the project and asking that she read them is not the best choice as this does little to engage Amy in the project better. Meeting with Amy and asking her how the project manager can help her feel more engaged with the project is ideal, but the project manager should do more than just ask Amy how to be more engaged. Asking Amy's supervisor to talk to her about the importance of being engaged in the project is not the best choice as the project manager should work directly with Amy, rather than being punitive and going to Amy's supervisor.

During status update meetings with the project team, the project manager asks each team member to update what they have worked on in the last few days in order to assign new activities to team members. You notice that the length of status meetings has increased because members do not clearly understand the work. This could be happening for all the following reasons EXCEPT
Lack of responsibility assignment matrix
Lack of team involvement in project planning
Correct answer
Lack of resource leveling
Lack of work breakdown structure (WBS)
Overall explanation
Lack of resource leveling is to bring a schedule back on track. The other options are all reasons why the length of the status meeting could be increasing. You will need a work breakdown structure. Resource leveling can be utilized to flatten the number of hours for all resources. You should involve the team in project planning as they are the people closest to the project work.

Brett is a project manager for a large construction company. Currently, Brett is working on a project that will affect a large metropolitan city. The project is likely to be approved but has not been made public yet. Brett honestly does not know if the project will be embraced or disliked by the community. He also wants public input on the formation of the project, its milestones, and expected outcomes. Brett is looking for a method to shop the project's ideas to a small group before proceeding. What is a method that he can utilize to do this?
Correct answer
Focus groups
Phone surveys
Website vote
Skip the research and proceed
Overall explanation
Brett's instincts to gauge his stakeholders and their opinions are wise. A focus group allows for a sampling of the stakeholder's base and an opportunity for more in-depth discussion and opinions. Focus groups would be a valuable method for Brett to use. Phone surveys may be useful, but they are not very dynamic, and it is easy for people to be disingenuous or ignore the questions. A simple website vote would potentially reveal the project too soon and would be limited. Brett should not skip the research and proceed. It is important to have stakeholder support, especially for a project of this size.

Consider a project that uses centralized contracting and is now in the closing stages. The project manager, Lauren, has received validation for her product, has archived all project documents, and has received product feedback from the customer. However, two outstanding invoices must be paid to vendors. Can Lauren close this project?
Yes, when all project documents are archived, the project can be closed.
No, the project cannot be closed until vendors approve the project closure.
Yes, the project can be closed once the customer has validated and provided feedback on the product.
Correct answer
No, the project cannot be closed until all invoices are paid.
Overall explanation
Lauren should not close the project until the invoices are paid. Even though several project closure steps have been completed, the project cannot be officially closed until the invoices are paid and procurement is complete. Even if the customer validated and provided feedback on the product, the project cannot be closed unless the invoices are paid. The project documents should not be archived until the project is closed, and the project should not be closed until the invoices are paid. Vendors cannot approve of project closure.

Most team members have little technical domain knowledge and are unfamiliar with how to employ agile methods effectively. Leonardo recognizes this and does not want to have the team fail on their first agile project. What can Leonardo do to help adjust the team to agile methodologies?
Perform a retrospective to address the project team's deficiencies in agile methodologies.
Recommend terminating the project until the team members learn agile methodologies.
Let the team members figure everything out as agile teams should be empowered and self-directing.
Correct answer
Assign and direct the team members until they gain the necessary skills to become self-directing.
Overall explanation
While assigning and directing team members may seem backward to agile, Leonardo can more seamlessly transition from a traditional to an adaptive approach if he leads the team in the beginning. Letting the team members figure things out is setting up the team for failure. In the beginning, the team needs a lot of support and coaching. The team will best learn by doing in a safe environment with proper guidance. Canceling the project is not the best choice for this scenario. Although retrospectives can be directed to fill knowledge gaps and refresh memory, the team that just started implementing agile would quickly feel defeated and incapable if they had to wait for the retrospectives to correct their knowledge.

Overall explanation
You should direct Simon to consult the team charter, which outlines the work expectations and the team's expectations. The project charter is a document that authorizes the project and the project manager. The project management plan defines the intention of how the project should be managed and is not utilized in a scrum project.

As a project manager of a highly visible project within your company, you are responsible for facilitating risk assessment meetings with key stakeholders and the project team and reducing the organization's risk. During the risk identification and assessment meeting, your team identifies and brings to your attention two stakeholders who exaggerate the impact of a risk. What is an effective way to overcome bias when assessing risks?
Exercise an assumption analysis to investigate assumptions.
Correct answer
Perform a qualitative risk analysis with the aid of a neutral facilitator.
Develop a risk response strategy just in case.
Perform sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact.
Overall explanation
The project manager does not know the stakeholder's bias for the potential risk. The project manager should use a trained neutral facilitator to perform a qualitative risk analysis to discover potential risks. Engaging a neutral facilitator often supports the qualitative risk analysis process and gains the stakeholders and the internal team's trust. Exercising an assumption analysis to investigate assumptions is not the best choice presented. The qualitative analysis would challenge assumptions about the risk probability and impact. Developing a risk response strategy just in case is not the best choice as this can take time and money for a risk that does not need an in-depth strategy to manage. Performing a sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact would take longer than necessary without first judging the probability and impact in qualitative analysis.

As a project manager, you have realized that there are objectives that need to be considered when entering contract negotiations. What is an important objective that should be considered during contract negotiations?
Have the project teams ensure that all risks are considered ensuring the project is delivered on time and budget.
Make sure that regardless of the situation that your organization's demands are always met. This way, you can make sure that the project is perfect.
Focus on the immediate artifacts and fixed milestones to assure stakeholders that the project is progressing as it should.
Correct answer
Approach the negotiation with an ideal collaborative mindset that allows all parties to share in a risk-reward relationship, ensuring all sides win.
Overall explanation
When all sides view the contract as a win-win, there is less risk. When there is a focus on collaboration instead of one-sided gain, all parties feel that there is fairness to the contract. There is no real guarantee in contract negotiations that your project will be perfect. All projects have risks. Not all risks are considered; for example, a meteor could hit your project site. All projects have risks that are called unknown unknowns, which are risks you could not have planned for in the project. Focusing on the immediate artifacts and fixed milestones does not ensure the project will be successful. This is but one portion of project planning.

Shirley is not a native to this place but moved there when she was thirty-five years old and considers it her home. Shirley is eating at a local restaurant, and a local man in his sixties invites himself to a conversation about the project. He is highly suspicious of Shirley's non-native status and what the construction project is doing to the city he grew up. How should Shirley handle this?
Mentor him and get him involved in the project.
Correct answer
Schedule a meeting to discuss the project.
Tell him to go away because he is not a real stakeholder.
Ignore him and eat her dinner.
Overall explanation
Stakeholders come in all shapes and sizes and often feel entitled to offer their opinion on the project. There is little Shirley can do in this situation, but the best choice presented is to schedule a meeting with the stakeholder. The stakeholder could be an important person in the community or could just be lonely. However, as a project manager, we should treat every stakeholder with respect. Shirley should thank him for his interest and schedule a meeting with him to discuss pertinent parts of the project during working hours. Naturally, there are limits to how much she can discuss, but since it is a public project, she can discuss the benefits and goals of the project and her love for the city. This small meeting may go a long way in connecting with other stakeholders with concerns. Ignoring him, pushing him out, or dismissing him is a bad strategy. In a small or mid-sized town, a reputation for not caring could spread quickly. Mentoring an individual in a project is more for people doing the work, not for a stakeholder concerned about the project's outcome. There is no reason to be rude to the man. He obviously cares about the project and the impact it will have on his city.

The city council requests that Morgan investigate these tunnels to ensure they do not lead to historical grounds. Morgan does not have the resources to investigate this matter, so he decides to outsource to a specialized geological unit. Which of the following contract types would be most appropriate in this scenario?
Firm fixed price (FFP)
Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA)
Correct answer
Time and material contracts (T&M)
Cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF)
Overall explanation
A Time and material contract (T&M) would be the most preferable in this scenario. This contract type is a hybrid type of contractual arrangement with aspects of both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. They are often used for staff augmentation, acquiring experts, and outside support when a precise statement of work cannot be quickly prescribed. As the tunnel system is mainly unknown to Morgan, his best course would be to augment his team with a specialized geological unit. A firm fixed price (FFP) contract is where the price is fixed and not changed unless the scope of work changes. A firm fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA) is a fixed-price contract, but with a special provision allowing for predefined final adjustments to the contract price due to changed conditions, such as inflation or raw material costs increasing or decreasing.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
Correct answer
Motivation-Hygiene Theory
Overall explanation
This theory is Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory. Hygiene agents are the things that are expected, such as a paycheck and do little to motivate. Motivating agents are rewards, such as bonuses or time off, for the employee's work that meets goals. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs describes the five levels of needs we all need and strive for. A person cannot reach the need above if the need below is not met. The five levels are physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization.

Because the team was picked by management, they know it is essential that they get along.
It is not important for the team members to get along with each other.
Correct answer
Many of the team members have worked on projects together before Farah’s project.
Most of the team members work in the same department at Delcon.
Overall explanation
As the team lead, Farah needs to determine which stage the team is in and plan from there. Because this team has worked together before, the initial stage of forming is not as vital as it would be for a whole new team. Even teams that are chosen by management will still need to go through the forming stage. Teams should and do need to care if they get along. Just because a team is from the same department does not mean they have worked on a project together before.

Mikayla is a project manager with many years of experience in the construction industry. After moving into the software development industry, she manages her first agile project. What might she want to ensure her project team understands in an agile project more so than in a traditional waterfall project when planning for potential problems?
The definition of the problem.
The strategy for addressing the problem.
Correct answer
The triggers and signals of an upcoming problem.
The roles of those involved in the problem.
Overall explanation
Because agile projects are adaptive, it is critical to be aware of triggers and signals of an upcoming problem. In agile projects, the scope is not defined for the entire project upfront, meaning the team will need to have a shared understanding of what potential problems may arise and how to get ahead of them. While understanding the definition of the problem, the roles of those involved in the problem, and the strategy for addressing the problem are all critical in any project, these are done similarly across agile projects and waterfall projects. The roles of those involved in the problem is not the best choice as the entire team should be on the lookout for triggers and signals of problems that may affect the project. The strategy for addressing the problem can only be addressed once a problem has been identified; not all problems will have the same strategy.

Previous, similar projects
Industry information
Management reserves

Contingency reserves are resources, like time or money, set aside for unexpected outcomes related to specific risks (or known unknowns). Knowledge of previous, similar project budgets is an excellent basis for estimating a project's budget but is not what is being asked in this question.

Question 102
Skipped
As an agile project manager, you are currently working with a self-organizing team approaching their third sprint's halfway point. It is Monday morning, and the product owner has approached the team and is asking to add two important features that the customer would like to utilize right away. Which team decision would you most likely support?
Canceling the current sprint and asking the team to start over.
Increasing the length of the sprint to allow time for the team to work on the features.
Correct answer
Advising the product owner that the goals of the sprint cannot change during the sprint.
Asking the product owner to submit a change request.
Overall explanation
Changing the sprint backlog by adding more features is not recommended while the sprint is in progress and nears the halfway point. Supplementing the sprint backlog work is not recommended until the sprint is complete. The product owner should add the changes to the product backlog for prioritization for the next iteration. The length of the sprint does not change. There is no reason to cancel the current sprint.

Bradley is a project manager for Albert Brother Company and has been assigned to a new project. The new team has had its first meeting, and Bradley is developing the team charter. Once he finished developing the team charter, he presented it to the team as a finished item. He asked them if they had any questions regarding the values, agreements, or operating guidelines. Why would the new team seem agitated at Bradley's approach to the team charter?
Correct answer
The team was not given a chance to contribute to it.
They already had a team charter from the previous project.
It was not on the company letterhead.
The team does not like the format of the team charter.
Overall explanation
The team charter works best when the team develops it or at least has a chance to contribute to it. All project team members share the responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are followed. The team not liking the team charter format is not the best option, as the team should create the charter together, not only through the project manager. Previous project charters may be used as a reference or template, but the best choice is that the team creates the team charter. The letterhead is not a valid choice. The best choice is that the team creates the team charter.

Julie is the project manager for a software development project. Julie just held the projects kickoff meeting, and in the meeting, she discussed a prominent risk in the project. The risk discussed involved dealing with the electrical work that Julie has outsourced to a licensed electrician. What type of risk response has she enacted?
Mitigation
Correct answer
Transference
Preemptive
Contractual
Overall explanation
Julie has used the transference risk response. Transference means the risk ownership is transferred to a third party; in this case, it is the licensed electrician. Mitigation is steps taken to reduce the probability/impact of the risk event. Preemptive is not a valid risk response type, so this choice is incorrect. Transference may be used in contracts, but this is not the term assigned to the risk response. Contractual is not a valid risk response type, so this choice is incorrect.

Jaclyn is a veteran project manager who inherited a new project team with very guarded answers and ideas. This team is nervous, results-driven, and avoids conflict or any semblance of it with Jaclyn, stakeholders, or each other. Through numerous conversations with team members, she finds out that the previous project manager was authoritarian and extremely results-oriented with a short fuse. Jaclyn wishes to remove this type of thinking and institute a culture of trust and participation. She wants to trust the team members to do their work and not micromanage them. Jaclyn leans towards which theory of motivation?
Myers-Briggs
MacGyver Theory A
Correct answer
McGregor Theory Y
McGregor Theory X
Overall explanation
Jaclyn manages this team in the aftermath of a previous authoritarian manager and leaned on McGregor's Theory X. Jaclyn wants to displace this primal way of doing things and replace it with McGregor's Theory Y. This theory presumes more intelligence, drive, and values autonomy more than its counterpart. McGregor's Theory X is what the previous project manager implemented through micromanagement and an authoritative attitude. MacGyver's Theory A does not exist, so this is not a valid answer. While a Myers-Briggs test might help her understand her team better, the more pressing issue is removing the authoritarian style and replacing it with a better model.

Lindsay is a project manager for a complex software development project. Her project follows the best agile practices. Lindsay is looking to ensure that knowledge transfer is happening within her project team. How can Lindsay encourage knowledge transfer engagingly?
Make two developers on the team responsible for each process.
Ensure that the functional manager knows how to complete each process.
Ask each developer to write documentation on each process they complete.
Correct answer
Encourage developers to pair together and program together.
Overall explanation
Lindsay should encourage paired programming with the developers. Paired programming will ensure that multiple people understand and have experience completing the work. While written documentation is helpful, it is not as engaging as paired programming. While making two developers responsible for a process is helpful, it is not as engaging as paired programming. Everyone on the team should have understanding and experience with each process. While it is beneficial that the functional manager knows how to do everything, the developers should understand it themselves.

Margret is on a scrum team working on a telecommunications project. The scrum master encourages the team to be self-organizing. Halfway through the current sprint, one of the development team members encounters a tricky problem. What would be the most helpful action the team member could take to improve the team's problem-solving proficiency?
Correct answer
Bring the problem to other team members and ask for help.
Figure out a solution using individual expertise. Move ahead to work on the next item so that velocity is not disrupted.
Keep moving forward and make a note of it to discuss during the retrospective meeting.
Immediately inform the scrum master since it is their job to remove impediments to progress.
Overall explanation
Agile teams rely on collaborative problem solving rather than individual ingenuity. This allows problems to be solved more quickly and generates better solutions by drawing upon a broader range of viewpoints. Problems are solved more quickly and effectively when diverse minds are brought together. This collaborative way of working encourages project team members to openly share their problems and help sustain knowledge for the future, improving the team's problem-solving proficiency. Although it is the scrum master's role to remove impediments, that primarily refers to external roadblocks. In many cases, only they have the expertise needed to resolve the issue of development. So, those kinds of problems cannot be delegated to the scrum master. Agile teams rely on collaborative problem solving rather than individual ingenuity. The retrospective is a meeting where team members improve the way they work; they do not solve problems related to tasks and user stories on the retrospective.

You are the project manager of the All-County Bridge Project for your organization. This project is designed to identify and document the status and location of every public bridge in your state. The state hired your firm to complete the assignment. There will be an incentive offered if the work is completed by the end of the year. The project will require team members to travel to each bridge, mark the GPS position, photograph the bridge from several angles, and catalog the information in specialized software. Henry, a project team member, reports that he thinks a faster method the team should try is to use a long-distance drone that can complete the work for several bridges in a five-mile radius instead of driving to each bridge. The team likes this idea and would like to try it. What should you do next?
Decline the idea as there are too many unknown factors.
Submit a change request to change the project plan.
Approve the idea as it will save time and money.
Correct answer
Submit a change request to purchase a drone.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to submit a change request to purchase a drone. Granted, these choices are ambiguous and do not offer insight into all the reasoning, but this is a typical exam question where you must choose the best option presented. This choice is best because you rarely need a change request to change the project plan but will always need a change request to purchase new equipment. Declining the idea as there are too many unknown factors is not the best choice as the team should experiment and look for innovations. Approving the idea is tempting, as it will save time and money, but this decision likely is not up to the project manager. Submitting a change request to change the project plan is not the best choice as you rarely need a change request to update the project plan, but you will always need a change request to purchase new equipment.

Correct answer
Inform all project stakeholders about the deliverables.
Share the update with the product owner.
Wait for the sprint review to share the update.
Do nothing. The project team will share the news.
Overall explanation
Fernanda should ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the new benefits Project D provides them. Waiting is not the best option as not all stakeholders will be at the review. The project team is not responsible for sharing project updates. Sharing the update with only the product owner is not ideal since all stakeholders should know about these updates.

After much deliberation, you select Tom, who has shown exceptional skills in programming. However, after three months, you receive a report that Tom has not been performing at the level you expected him in his new role. What rule did you overlook when you recommended Tom for a promotion?
Expectancy theory
Pareto principle
Murphy’s Law
Correct answer
Halo Effect
Overall explanation
You likely overlooked the halo effect in this scenario. The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias in which a person’s overall impression influences how we feel and think about their character. The Pareto principle states that 80 percent of consequences come from 20 percent of the causes. Murphy’s Law states that “anything that can go wrong will go wrong.” The expectancy theory proposes that individuals will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behavior over others due to what they expect from that chosen behavior.

Patricia works at a software development company. They work in two-week sprints to complete features requested by stakeholders during road mapping sessions. All the features receive estimates for their effort level and are subsequently prioritized by order of importance in an easily accessible Kanban board. Developers draw from the features and work on them as they have time available. A scrum master hosts daily meetings to discuss blockers or anything else that requires attention from the stakeholders or the project sponsor. Which project life cycle is appropriate?
Incremental
Correct answer
Agile
Iterative
Predictive
Overall explanation
Agile project life cycles continuously elaborate their requirements based on feedback obtained following a sprint to add a feature or group of features to a product. Sprints, Kanban boards, and scrum masters are used in agile-based methodologies. Predictive project life cycles are based on the specification of requirements and substantial planning during the beginning phases of a project. Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project's life cycle. Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time.

You are a project manager in the construction industry and are in the process of earning PDUs for your PMP certification. In a formal project management training, your instructor informs the class of documentation used to collect information on contract schedule, scope, quality, and cost performance, along with all contract change documentation, payment records, and inspection results. Your instructor also informs the class that this information can be used for lessons learned and as a basis for evaluating contractors for future contracts. Your instructor is referring to the use of which of the following documents?
Close project or phase
Inspections and audit updates
Claims administration
Correct answer
Procurement documentation
Overall explanation
In order to close the contract, all procurement documentation is collected, indexed, and filed. Information on contract schedule, scope, quality, and cost performance, along with all contract change documentation, payment records, and inspection results, are cataloged. This information can be used for lessons learned and as a basis for evaluating contractors for future contracts. Claims Administration means the processing of claims. An inspection is typically something that a site is required to do by a compliance obligation.

This review is not to be judgmental, but to ensure that the team members have the needed skills and also provide Beth and the team members a path for coaching and improvement. What is the best course of action Beth should take when she identifies skills gap for a project team member?
Work with centralized contracting to procure contractors to fill the gap.
Remove the work items from the team member's assignments and give the team member less important work to complete.
Replace the project team member, but recommend additional training via the human resource department.
Correct answer
Have an honest and emotionally intelligent conversation about the needed skills and create a path for improvement.
Overall explanation
An honest and emotionally intelligent conversation with the team member will help Beth and the team member. Within the conversation, Beth and the team member can work together for a resolution and create a goal for the needed skills. This can be training outside the project, peer-to-peer learning, or other solutions for the team member to learn and move forward in the project. Replacing the team is sometimes acceptable – especially if the skills gap is large, but this is not the first step or best answer for this scenario. It is always best, especially for your PMP exam, to coach and work with the team member to help them become a better team member. Beth may not have the authority, time, or funds to procure new resources. Giving the team member less important assignments does not solve the problem of the skills gap. This action can also be demeaning to the team member.

He also notices that a significant milestone is quickly approaching. What should Vernon do to organize around his new team's strengths quickly?
Correct answer
Schedule one-on-one discussions.
Distribute surveys and questionnaires.
Observe the team members working.
Reassign the team members based on intuition.
Overall explanation
One-on-one discussions with a team of five should not take long and will allow team members to speak freely about their interests and aptitudes as they relate to the project. Surveys and questionnaires are better for large teams, and they also take a long time to put together.

The previous project manager did not establish any key performance indicators to analyze the project's success or failure. After reviewing the project scope statement and talking with the project team members, Martina knows that she completed a similar but not identical project seven years ago. What is the best choice that Martina should make next in this scenario?
Copy the KPIs from the old project.
Start fresh and ignore the old project.
Correct answer
Create new KPIs using the old project as a resource.
Talk to the previous project manager about the problems.
Overall explanation
Martina is wise to hold onto her work from years gone by, as sometimes history repeats itself.  Martina should not ignore the old data, but she also should not blindly copy it either. The best approach here is to use the old KPI information as a reference while examining this new project to develop key performance indicators unique to this project and time. Martina should not ignore the old data, but she also should not blindly copy it either. Every project is different, and much may have changed over the past seven years. Historical information can be a good input to current planning but rarely applies exactly to current projects. Ignoring old data will make Martina invest much more time to develop KPIs for the new project. Even though Martina could talk to the previous project manager, it may not help her establish the KPIs.

This project will require your local team members to be in remote cities to complete the project work over the next four months. Team members have expressed frustration over having to work virtually and feel a loss of communication. As the project manager, what are ways that you can help increase engagement?
Send out emails that include links to daily meditations, yoga clinics, and gyms to help team members break the monotony of working remotely.
Correct answer
Integrate daily video conferencing, allowing team members to interact virtually.
Encourage team members to socialize outside of office hours with the clients.
Have management do away with virtual teams altogether, making no excuse for the loss of communication.
Overall explanation
When integrating daily video conferencing, you effectively allow each team member to read body language and understand on a deeper level what the other is saying. Face-to-face conversation, even virtually, enables a level of engagement that an email, text, or even an audio conference call does not afford. Doing away with virtual teams will not be realistic for this project, since the work is at remote facilities throughout the US. Socializing with the client outside of the working hours does nothing to improve the project team communication. Unsolicited emails with yoga tips and meditation information can be email clutter and is not the effective project management communication the team is asking for.

Checklists are a simple but effective quality management tool that the project manager can use to ensure the project team completes all the required work identically each time. A quality checklist can be a list of items to inspect, a list of steps to be performed, or a picture of the item to be inspected, with space to note any defects found. Check sheets are used in quality control to track data, such as the type and frequency of quality problems uncovered during the inspection.

Of the following choices, which best describes why Thema would direct the stakeholder to the product manager?
Thelma does not like this stakeholder.
The stakeholder is not following the agile procedure by speaking to Thelma.
Correct answer
The product owner will be able to determine those tasks' value to Project Eghart.
The product owner is the only one who can add tasks to Project Eghart.
Overall explanation
The product owner is best able to determine which features will provide value to Project Eghart. So, while anyone can request features to the product backlog, only the product owner can prioritize them. Thelma not liking the stakeholder is not a valid response. The product owner adds features and user stories, not tasks, to the project. Anyone can request a feature, but it is the product owner who maintains the product backlog. Features are written as user stories, and the team does the tasks in the sprint backlog.

The competitor is named Stanley Software. Although Gene and his team are releasing working software with each sprint, they are behind the competitor. Gene’s product is meeting their internal expectations, and they successfully implement every item on their backlog. They are baffled as to why Stanley Software seems to be so far ahead. What should Gene be examining to make sure that his product is market-worthy?
Gene should stick to his current process since they are releasing on schedule.
Correct answer
Gene should examine the current business needs.
Gene should copy Stanley Software and their features.
Gene should get his team to work the backlog faster.
Overall explanation
Gene cannot continue to produce a product or project that nobody wants. His team is functional and is creating working software, but it has to fulfill a need. Copying Stanley Software may help in the short term, but to truly make headway, Gene needs to examine the business need to make sure that what he is creating is filling a current need. If not, the current project may need to be terminated or altered to meet the market. The team cannot necessarily work the backlog faster. Rushing the team can create animosity, stress, quality errors and introduce risk to the project. While this choice is tempting, there needs to be an examination of the business need and ensure that the project deliverable is still needed.

You are the project manager of the GDS project. The project is in month seven and is scheduled to last 15 months. Management has decided to cancel the project altogether due to circumstances outside of your control and does not hold you responsible for the project cancellation. Which of the following statements best describes scope validation in this case?
Scope validation is not needed because the scope was never fulfilled.
Correct answer
Scope validation should be measured against the deliverables that were created up to the point of the project’s cancellation.
Scope validation should be deemed successful because management canceled the project due to circumstances outside of your control.
Scope validation is not needed unless the project is more than 50 percent complete.
Overall explanation
Although the project has been canceled, scope validation should take place for the deliverables up to the point the project was canceled. Scope validation is still needed, although management canceled the project due to outside circumstances. Although the scope was never completed, scope validation is still needed. This is not a valid option for the question.

Judy's team has been working to implement a new feature in her company's flagship software. The feature allows users to organize their to-do items in a way that matches their prioritization. Unfortunately, another team has been working independently on the software and decided to do away with the form that allowed users to enter their to-do items. Their change goes into production, while Judy's team is still working on finishing their feature. Judy's team's feature cannot be implemented if the other team does not allow for to-do items to be entered. What is this an example of?
Correct answer
A blocker
An obstacle
A pothole
An impediment
Overall explanation
If no progress can be made, a blocker is in effect. The team will need to find a workaround or resolve the blocker before it can proceed. Alternatively, the team may decide not to proceed. An impediment slows but does not stop a process or action. An obstacle is a challenge, but not an impossibility. A pothole is not a valid project management term.

Martina is the project manager of the Speedway Project. As she and the project team study the project management plan and its components, it becomes clear that the team does not understand why the project needs so much information. The difference between a project baseline and a project plan is what?
A baseline is a snippet of the project plan, while project plans change as needed.
Correct answer
A project baseline is a control tool, while project plans are tools for execution.
Baselines only change at milestones, while project plans change as needed.
Baselines and project plans are amended – they do not change.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is that a project baseline is used as a control tool, while the project plan's execution and work results are measured against project baselines. A baseline is more than just a snippet of the project plan – it is the expectation of how the work should be done. Project baselines and project plans do change. Baselines can change along with the project plan.

Daphne is creating a list of deliverables and specifications for the project she manages. When finished, she assigns each deliverable an estimated budget and reviews the combined budget with her program's sponsor. The sponsor reviews the figures and makes several suggestions based on where the money for different project parts will be derived. Daphne takes the sponsor's feedback and makes several adjustments before finalizing the project budget. Which aspect of expert judgment is being used to determine the budget?
Correct answer
Funding requirements and sources
Industry information
Previous, similar projects
Financial principles
Overall explanation
Funding requirements and sources are the foundation of a feasible budget since there can be no budget without them. Knowledge of previous, similar project budgets is an excellent basis for estimating a project's budget however is not what is described in this question. Industry information, especially information related to pricing and supply trends, can help teams anticipate a given project's budget needs; however, it is not described in this question.

Mark is creating a mobile phone game that teaches children mathematics in a fun way. Parents have requested to test the product every two weeks to provide feedback and suggestions to improve the game in subsequent iterations. Other stakeholders within the organization have suggested more features to improve the playing experience. Mathematicians have suggested more advanced mathematic equations as players progress through the levels. Which user requirement should the project team focus on first?
Additional features to improve the playing experience.
Correct answer
Parent feedback to improve the game.
Accomplishing all the requirements in the first iteration.
More advanced math equations.
Overall explanation
The mobile application focuses on teaching children mathematics in a fun way. The customers are parents, and their feedback is required for the product to meet customer demand. As the parents will be the application's end-users, their feedback will be the most valuable for developing the application making their suggestion the primary focus. Additional features to improve the playing experience are important; however, they are not the project priority. The software is implemented using an iteration process, and all requirements are not expected to be implemented at the end of the first iteration. Adding more advanced math equations may increase product demand; however, it is not the user requirement that the project team should focus on first.

The sponsor informs Walter to finish the planning as quickly as possible because the company has an extensive list of projects to complete in the coming year. Before starting to plan, Walter decides to review any project risks that have been identified at this point. Which document can he refer to for this review?
Risk report 
Issue log
Risk register
Correct answer
Project charter
Overall explanation
You might think that the project manager should review the risk register to learn about all identified risks. While that is correct, it is important to identify the state of the project first. Note that the question states the project manager is about to start planning the project, implying that the risk register is unavailable because it is created during the risk identification process. Only the project charter can be reviewed to understand the high-level risks identified when the project charter was drafted and approved at this point in the project. The risk report implies that the project is in the monitoring and controlling stage, and this project is in the planning stage. An issue log is a list of problems, gaps, inconsistencies, or conflicts that occur unexpectedly during the lifecycle of a project, and this project is in the planning stage.

Roger is frustrated with his firm. They get through their planned iterations, but he is often frustrated, regularly mentions the lack of support from superiors, and makes sure the team knows that some of the issues are just not his fault. Since he is the scrum master, how do you expect that the team is likely to feel?
Each person has their own feelings independent of Roger's behavior.
Correct answer
They are likely to feel a mood like Roger's.
They are more likely to be influenced by the mood of other resources on the delivery team since they spend much more time with them.
There is no way to determine their likely feelings based on the information given.
Overall explanation
A leader who is showing negative behavior and moods is likely to influence the behavior and moods of the team. Roger does likely have an influence. The team is likely not unaffected or affected more by other resources on the team since no additional details are provided about why that might be. There is enough information to make an educated guess that this behavior has an impact.

Bob is the construction manager for a multi-level bridge connecting two major cities. The bridge has a budget of $25,000,000 and must be completed within five years. Bob is working with a list of bidders to gain the most value out of the budget. Which of the following contract types would be most appropriate in this scenario?
Firm fixed price (FFP)
Cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF)
Time and material contracts (T&M)
Correct answer
Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA)
Overall explanation
A fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA) contract would be preferable in this scenario. This type of contract is used whenever the seller's performance period spans a considerable period of years (in this case, five years). It is a fixed-price contract, but with a special provision allowing for predefined final adjustments to the contract price due to changed conditions, such as inflation or raw material costs increasing or decreasing. A firm fixed price (FFP) contract is where the price is fixed and not changed unless the scope of work changes. A cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) is where the seller is reimbursed for all costs, plus a fixed fee for completion. A time and materials (T&M) contract is a mixture of a cost-plus contract and a fixed price contract.

Quality management plan
Project charter
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Correct answer
Procurement management plan
Overall explanation
Procurement management involves getting work done by people outside the project team. The procurement management plan includes performance reporting specifications that provide buyer organizations with information about how effectively the seller achieves the contractual objectives. A project charter is the statement of scope, objectives, and people participating in a project. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. Quality management planning determines quality policies and procedures relevant to the project for project deliverables and processes. It defines who is responsible for what and documents compliance.

Any agile methodology that has not been customized in any way. The best use of agile involves strict implementation without exceptions, especially as teams mature over time.
The scrum methodology, including timeboxed sprints, product owners, and all artifacts and events described by the methodology
Correct answer
There is no best method to implement agile, but teams should initially follow a proven approach.
A customized hybrid approach that combines the adaptability of Kanban and the standard rules implemented in Scrum
Overall explanation
There is no best method of implementing agile. It is recommended that new teams generally want to follow a methodology more strictly, but we do not know the maturity of Christopher’s team. There is no single right way to implement agile. Most teams end up customizing their approach as they mature in their understanding and practice of agile.

You are a scrum master for a marketing development firm and working closely with your team to bring incremental value to your client by using an agile mindset. Your team has gone through several sprints and is about to start planning for their next sprint. You have collected relevant information about the team's velocity. Based on this exhibit, what would you recommend to the team to help increase the accuracy of the team's velocity?




Correct answer
Increase the quality of estimates for story points.
Ask the product owner to provide more accurate story points.
Work only up to the sprint goal and not any further.
Increase the quality of work in each sprint.
Overall explanation
As the scrum team matures, the accuracy of their work should increase with each sprint. Focusing their efforts to systematically right-size the user stories will allow the team to better plan their work in each sprint and increase the accuracy of the velocity by delivering a consistent number of story points per iteration. There is no indication that quality is suffering in the project. This answer does not address the issue of the velocity variance. The team sizes the user stories, not the product owner.

Correct answer
Review whether all organizational governance processes have been executed.
Risk reduction
Process improvement
Quality of service
Overall explanation
A review of whether all organizational governance processes have been executed is typically completed during the closing phase of a project. The remaining answers suggest that the project is currently in the initiating phase. Quality of service benefits customers, such as quicker response to queries or providing information in a way the customers want. Process improvement allows an organization to do the same job with fewer resources, allowing cost reductions.

You reflect on the project, and you know that you have not followed up on communication as promised, and you now need to work to foster stakeholder support again. This all centers on stakeholder engagement for the project. What should you aim to do next in this scenario?
Correct answer
Do whatever it takes to communicate and satisfy the stakeholder concerns.
Have team members reach out to each stakeholder to discuss their concerns.
Communicate immediately with all stakeholders about their unhappiness.
Coordinate a meeting for the stakeholders to discuss the project goals.
Overall explanation
Although communication is critical for ensuring stakeholders engage with the project, stakeholder management's key objective is to ensure satisfaction. In this scenario, the goal is to do whatever it takes to regain stakeholder support. You do not need to communicate with all stakeholders, as not all stakeholders are unhappy. A meeting is not the best choice; the project goals have already been established. Team members do not need to take on the assignment of reaching out to stakeholders.

The project team will determine what user stories they will be able to complete from the prioritized backlog during the sprint planning meeting. This meeting happens at the launch of each sprint and allows the team to choose the user stories from the product backlog and create the sprint backlog. The initiation event is not a scrum ceremony, so this choice is incorrect. The kickoff meeting is not the time to plan the work for the sprint.

David, the construction manager, is concerned about quantifying different aspects of the project work to grasp the cost of standard resources better. The types of project work the organization completes for others last four to five months and are agriculture usage buildings, such as grain elevators, farms, and other structures. As Betty and the manager talk, she identifies one resource that is likely challenging to quantify for pricing. Which resource is this?
Metal
Commodities
Correct answer
People
Cash
Overall explanation
Human resources or people can be challenging to quantify in a project. While a project can be broken up into tasks and hours calculated, it is tougher to know how a human resource will perform. Training, education level, motivation, and other factors make human resources calculations a challenge. Cash is a resource that is easy to quantify – though forecasting revenue can be difficult. Metal, the material used in the agricultural building, is quantifiable based on the plans and architecture of the structure. Commodities are a quantifiable resource, though again, the price of the resource may fluctuate depending on market conditions.

Mateo needs to update the staffing management plan and what other document?
Risk register
Project schedule

Correct answer
Stakeholder register
Overall explanation
The stakeholder register is the document Mateo should update by providing information about stakeholders currently involved in the project. When a stakeholder leaves a project, the project manager must update the stakeholder register so that non-stakeholders are no longer included in project communications and engagement. A project manager does not necessarily update the risk register when a stakeholder leaves because the stakeholder’s absence will not always affect risk. A change log does not need to be updated simply because people have left the project. The project schedule does not always need to be updated because the stakeholder who has left may not affect the project’s schedule.

The sub-contractor begins raising his voice and threatens to walk out of the deal, but Timmy calms the sub-contractor down and convinces him to sell the fabrication service for $75,000. Which key trait of an effective negotiator BEST describes how Timmy conducted himself?
Well-developed negotiation skills
Correct answer
Comfortable with conflict
Understand different cultures
High aspiration level
Overall explanation
Most people are uncomfortable dealing with conflict and avoid conflict situations. In this case, Timmy was an effective negotiator because he was comfortable with conflict. Although the sub-contractor was raising his voice and threatening to walk out of the room, Timmy composed himself and worked through the compromise with the vendor. Although a high aspiration level may be true for Timmy, it would not help when dealing with conflict.

Willy should determine the unique communication needs of each stakeholder. This will allow him to best tailor his communication to fit their specific need. Communication is tied directly to stakeholder engagement, so it is best to understand better the communication needs to serve the stakeholders throughout the project. Setting up ongoing calls with each stakeholder is not ideal as Willy does not yet understand their needs.

Question 165
Skipped
As a PMP candidate, you will need to recognize several human resources theories and how they apply to your role as a project manager. One theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, defines our needs as humans. Which layer of the theory can best be described as our calling or purpose in our work and life?
Physiological
Self-esteem
Social
Correct answer
Self-actualization
Overall explanation
The highest point on Maslow's hierarchy of needs is self-actualization, and it describes one's calling or purpose in the work they do. Esteem is the pride you take in the work you complete and the respect you have earned from others. Social describes the need for friendship and relationships among your peers. Physiological describes the need for food and water and the items needed to live.

Steven wants to ensure that his team tries to minimize the costliest defects. To do so, Steven should measure
Average defect throughput
Correct answer
The rate of escaped defects
The rate of paired programming defects
Average defect cycle time
Overall explanation
The rate of escaped defects is the rate of bugs that ended up in the final product, which are the costliest to correct. Average defect cycle time and average defect throughput do not directly relate to defect cost but are focused more on time (which could be longer or shorter due to team size). Paired programming defects are caught very early in the cycle and much cheaper to correct.

Beth is a new project manager for her organization and she is working with you to get some on-the-job training and mentoring. You tell Beth that business value is often found in the benefits the project will create, and these should be captured as early as possible in the project. What will allow Beth to ensure that all project benefits are identified in a project?
Sharing all project reports with all stakeholders.
Ensuring that all change requests are approved.
Correct answer
Conducting a stakeholder analysis.
Composing a requirements traceability matrix.
Overall explanation
Conducting a stakeholder analysis will help ensure that all project benefits are identified. This allows all stakeholders to voice their hope towards the project. Sharing all project reports may be unnecessary and will not help identify project benefits. Approving all change requests is unnecessary and not helpful for identifying project benefits. Composing a requirements traceability matrix will help ensure that requirements are met, but these are only known requirements and may overlook unknown project benefits.

As the project manager of a hybrid, Edward is planning to facilitate a meeting between stakeholders having different agendas and coming together for the first time to discuss the project stakeholders' expectations for the project work. Before the meeting, Edward has prepared a table of constructive and destructive behaviors that could arise during the meeting to plan the mitigation measure. What should Edward do at the start of the meeting?
Encourage constructive behaviors and control destructive behaviors.
Reach agreement on the scope, approach, and expectations of the project.
Use a force field analysis.
Correct answer
Have those in attendance develop and agree on ground rules for the meeting.
Overall explanation
Edward should, in the meeting and the ground rules, define constructive behaviors and destructive behaviors. Stakeholders should agree on ground rules for the meeting, and it is best to have them engaged in the development of those rules. Reaching an agreement on the scope, approach, and expectations of the project is not the best thing for Edward to do next. In addition, in this hybrid project, we do not know what aspect of the project will utilize predictive, such as the project scope, or an agile attribute, such as the product backlog. Before getting into the definition of specific constructive and destructive behavior, Edward should work with the team to define the ground rules. The definition of the ground rules can serve as an input to what is acceptable or not acceptable in the project. Using a force field analysis is not the best choice. This approach can be useful when discussing forces for and against the project scope and requirements.

As part of the project team for the Aztec Project, Simon has some questions regarding risk identification. His project manager, Jessica, explains that risk identification is an iterative process in the project that requires the input of the project manager, project team, and other key stakeholders. Considering the nature of risk, when should risk identification occur?
Throughout the product management life cycle
As early as possible in the planning process
Correct answer
Throughout the life cycle of the project
As early as possible in the initiation process
Overall explanation
The correct answer is that risk identification is an iterative process that occurs throughout the project's life cycle. This response is incorrect because risk identification is not exclusive to any certain process group. Risk identification technically occurs throughout the project management life cycle, which is unique to each project, not the life cycle of the product. Risk identification is not exclusive to any certain process group; therefore, this response is incorrect.

Hobbs is working on a project to build a customized car for a high-profile client. As the project is nearing its completion, the client asks to have small screens installed into the back of the headrests. This addition will take time and additional funds. What should Hobbs do first?
Reject the work as it was not listed in the project scope.
Correct answer
Review the requested change against all other project constraints.
Direct the project team to get started on installing the screens.
Notify his immediate supervisor that the client is requesting the change.
Overall explanation
Hobbs should review the requested change against all other project constraints first. This process will allow him to understand better the work involved and how it will affect all aspects of the project. Project constraints include scope, cost, resource, quality, and risk. After performing the review, the change request can be analyzed further. Hobbs should not immediately reject the work or ask the team to get started with the request. This best choice is the review the change first and then determine if the change request is feasible. After the review, Hobbs should inform his immediate supervisor and the client how installing the screens will impact the project.

Project manager Shanae and her team are preparing the plan for their new project, the Angel Project. Which of the following is a project plan development constraint that Shanae and her team must consider?
Interviewing SMEs (subject matter experts) who are experienced in the project work in your project plan.
Project plans from similar projects that failed
Project plans from similar projects
Correct answer
The budget as assigned by management
Overall explanation
The correct response is the budget as assigned by management. When management has given the project a fixed budget constraint, the project manager and team must figure out how to run the project within that constraint. Interviews with SMEs is a valuable input tool, but it is not a constraint. Project plans from similar failed projects are considered a historical tool, not a constraint. Project plans from similar projects describe historical information, not a constraint.

This project aims to cut costs in the organization's shipping and delivery services. Gail wants to discuss quantifiable goals, but Marty, the project sponsor, does not know how that is possible. In this scenario, what steps should Gail discuss to establish effective goal setting for the project?
Correct answer
Definition, setting completion time, resource allotment, quality standards.
Establish project goals, sub-team goals, individual goals, define reward and recognition plan.
Setting quality standards, defining other contributions.
Negotiation, resource allotment, published goals.
Overall explanation
The steps to effective goal setting are definition, setting completion time, resource allotment, and quality standards. Goals should also be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Negotiation, resource allotment, and published goals do not quantify the goals. Definition, setting completion time, resource allotment, quality standards do not address the specifics of the goal, a timetable, how to measure the goal, and other factors Gail would need to be successful.

Linda's project development team had two solutions to address a significant issue. The development team had a face-to-face meeting where they expressed common ground between solutions and dissension points. A team ground rule was to make decisions based on majority rule. Each development team member reviewed the data, then voted candidly, following their best judgment. Solution A received 51 percent of the votes, and Solution B received 49 percent. Another team ground rule was that once the team decided, the entire team owned that decision, and there would be no "I told you so's" afterward. The team would present a united front following the meeting. Linda was concerned about whether the team had reached a true consensus. What should Linda do next?
Correct answer
Suggest that the team consider adding a team ground rule for decision-making on significant decisions where votes are close.
Nothing. The team is handling the issue.
Continue to communicate the agreed-upon solution after the meeting because commitment is sustained over time.
Change the decision-making rule for significant decisions to unanimous consent.
Overall explanation
A possible team rule would be that when the first round of voting is close on significant issues, the team would express their voting rationale and have a second vote. Doing nothing is not the best choice for this scenario as the issue needs to be addressed and future issues circumvented. Team decision-making rules should have guidelines for handling major issues and ensuring consensus when the initial vote is close. The terms "major" and "close" would need to be defined.

Business risk
Correct answer
Pure risks
Life risk
Risk acceptance
Overall explanation
The correct answer is pure risks, which could threaten the safety of the people on the project. Risk acceptance is not a relevant term and is incorrect. Life risks are incorrect because it is not a relevant term. Business risks are incorrect because they are defined as risks that affect a project's financial losses and gains.

Don is building a treehouse for his kids. Since he lives far from the hardware and building supply stores, he prefers to make only one trip. Before he leaves, he makes a drawing of the treehouse, a list of all the necessary materials and tools he will need to rent or buy, and rents a truck to haul the materials back to his house. Which project life cycle is appropriate?
Agile
Incremental
Iterative
Correct answer
Predictive
Overall explanation
Predictive project life cycles are based on the specification of requirements and substantial planning during the beginning phases of a project. Because Don lives far away from hardware and building supply stores, he will plan as much of the project upfront as possible. Iterative project life cycles are characterized by multiple planning sessions covering all or most aspects of a project throughout the project's life cycle. Incremental project life cycles include a series of small or manageable steps that are planned to be implemented over time. Agile project life cycles continuously elaborate their requirements based on feedback obtained following a sprint to add a feature or group of features to a product.

Overall explanation
Scope validation is the assurance that the project deliverables have met the project scope and is typically performed at the end of each project phase. Scope validation does not happen only at the end of a project. Each deliverable does not demand a scope validation as they are created. Scope validation happens as phases or projects are completed, not only when the customer sees fit.

Peter is the scrum master for a team developing a software application designed specifically for healthcare professionals to better coordinate with their patients through cloud-based programs. The team primarily consists of members who only have experience through IT, and there are no members with healthcare experience. Peter believes they should extend the team by hiring a healthcare professional to consult with while developing the application. What benefit for an adaptive environment best addresses the scenario above?
Generalizing specialists
Aggressive transparency
Iterative scheduling
Correct answer
A collaborative working relationship
Overall explanation
A collaborative working relationship can lead to a shared risk model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated with the project. Aggressive transparency is where the project team invites all stakeholders to project meetings and allows them to post-project artifacts in public spaces to minimize the probability of unexpected change requests or other project failures. It is also used when referencing remote work and being transparent to others on the team or in the workplace. Iterative scheduling is a scheduling technique used in agile projects where the project schedule is iteratively developed throughout the project. Generalizing specialists are used in agile projects where one person is an expert at a specific task but can also perform other tasks.

Jeremy is facilitating his project team on estimating the time it will take to complete a feature. His team is using the Fibonacci series for estimating. The feature was to add email functionality. Each member reviewed the feature, then selected a card with a number for the estimate and placed it face down. When Jeremy asked them to turn their cards over, he was surprised. One team member turned over a five-card and stated that the feature could be added in five days. Another team member turned over a twenty-one card and stated that the feature could be added in twenty-one weeks. The remainder of the team estimated eight or thirteen days. What should Jeremy do NEXT?
Use the average of all the numbers.
Find the standard deviation, using five as the optimistic estimate and 21 weeks as the pessimistic estimate.
Correct answer
Ask members to explain their assumptions to determine the cause of the misunderstanding.
Throw out the five-day and twenty-one-week estimates as outliers.
Overall explanation
Ask members to explain their assumptions to determine the cause of the misunderstanding. Using the average of all numbers is a tempting answer, but it does not first address the large variation in responses that may be due to a misunderstanding among the team members. There is no need to work on the standard deviation without first be assured that the team members understood what was required of them in the exercise. It would not be a correct choice to throw out the five-day and twenty-one-week estimates as these may need to be discussed for accuracy and team the member's understanding of the exercise.

Early in the project, you and the project team worked together to establish the needed ground rules, and during the planning process, everyone on the project team agreed to the rules. Now that the project is underway, two of the team members are in conflict about the rules. They seem to be interpreting the ground rules differently, and they have come to you for a resolution. What step should have been taken when creating the team ground rules to eliminate this type of scenario?
Demand an environment of trust, respect, and transparency.
Establish a formal grievance mechanism.
Correct answer
Establish procedures for decision-making and for changing the rules.
Establish a governing board.
Overall explanation
Once rules are made, for flexibility, they need procedures for changes. When creating the rules, it is best to explain that there may be times when you need to make decisions that not everyone on the project will like. You might also need to adjust the rules with the project team and possibly even create more rules depending on the scenarios that evolve within the project. Demanding an environment of trust, respect, and transparency can be authoritarian and conflicts with the idea of trust, respect, and transparency among the team. Establishing a formal grievance mechanism conflicts with trust and transparency in communication. Establishing a governing board, like the formal grievance approach, conflicts with openness, trust, and transparency among the project team.

Gary is the scrum master for a software development project. A minimum viable product (MVP) is required to be delivered to the client at the end of every sprint, which is every four weeks. Gary oversees a scrum team consisting of fifteen individuals. Eight of the project team members have completed similar projects in the organization, so Gary feels their experience and leadership will benefit the other project team members. The deadline for the release of the next deliverable to the client is in three days, but the scrum team feels it will not be ready to produce an MVP on time. Before any further developments can be made, Gary decides to determine the source of the conflict and prevent it from happening again. What was the most likely reason for the scrum team to experience delays?
The sprint duration was too short.
Correct answer
There were too many individuals assigned to the scrum team.
The scope of the project was beyond the team's capabilities.
There were too many small user stories for the team to clarify the client's requirements.
Overall explanation
The ideal size for a development team is between three and nine people, not including the scrum master and product owner. In this scenario, there were fifteen individuals assigned to the scrum team. For this reason, the communication channels became complex and cumbersome. If the team were smaller, the team could accomplish enough during each sprint. A sprint duration of four weeks is normal for the scrum methodology. While the project's scope may have been a factor in this conflict, many of the project team members have completed similar projects in the organization. Having too many small user stories is applicable to how the sprint backlog is created based on user story points.

A new team member that recently joined the project is used to an agile project management methodology. Because of this, the new team member is pushing back against the amount of planning that Sarah is scheduling. She tells Sarah that long-term planning is not effective as requirements shift so frequently. What should Sarah do?
Agree and change to an agile methodology.
Request that the new team member adjusts or leaves the team.
Correct answer
Walk the new team member through the project and explain why a predictive methodology is useful in this case.
Create a hybrid approach for the new team member.
Overall explanation
Some projects benefit from predictive planning, and a newcomer may not be aware of how predictive projects work. Giving a walkthrough of the project and showing how a predictive methodology is beneficial for the project could help new team member understand that agile may not be the best fit. Changing the methodology is not a light decision and may not be the best solution for this project.

Overall explanation
Greg needs to understand that his behavior is not acceptable at the team meetings, but Mike also needs to understand why it occurred. It is possible Greg is concerned about the project being over budget or that something else is bothering him. Doing nothing will not help Mike understand Greg's outburst. Complaining about Greg will do nothing to help the situation.

Overall explanation
Given the stakeholder's agitated state Kim should avoid direct conflict and allow him to calm down. Listening to the demands and then following up later will be the best option for the described scenario. Ignoring the stakeholder is not a good idea and would most likely negatively impact the relationship. Having a team member speak to the stakeholder is not ideal as they may not have appropriate answers.

A clear mission will help the team focus on Project F5E's objectives.
The project management office requires a mission statement.
Finneus needs to spend a certain amount of time planning Project F5E.
The mission statement is necessary for the scope statement.
Overall explanation
Having a clear mission statement will help Project F5E stay on track and provide guidance when the team cannot determine the best course of action. The project management office requiring a mission statement is not the best answer. A mission statement helps the team focus on project objectives. There is no required amount of planning other than what is appropriate and needed. Each project will spend a different amount of time on planning.

Project Q, which is in its planning stage and has a budget of $620,000. Eugene will be managing the project, which will be the first within the organization to utilize a new material during its execution. There is a risk that the material could be wasted due to the first-time, first-use penalty. While planning, a stakeholder recommends Eugene set aside money specifically for team training. Why should Eugene set aside funds for training?
Project Q is training-centric.
Project Q's primary customer base is teachers.
Correct answer
Training the team is a necessary part of most projects.
Project Q's team is relatively inexperienced.
Overall explanation
Training is a standard part of many projects and is necessary to ensure that the team can complete the project successfully. This project will utilize a new material, so training the team can mitigate the first-time, first-use penalty risk. The first-time, first-use penalty is the risk of additional time and costs when you first use a new resource. Training centric is not a valid answer or a valid project management term. Training for the project team to complete the work is not typically affected by the organization's customer base. If the question told us that the team is made of inexperienced workers, then perhaps this choice would be acceptable.

Four of your project team members come to you with concerns that a specific vendor they are working with fails to meet their contractual agreement and they are requesting Hugh to act. What should Hugh do next?
Terminate the vendor's contract.
Correct answer
Review the vendor's agreement.
Ask the project team how the vendor is doing.
Begin looking for another vendor.
Overall explanation
Before acting, Hugh should review any available contracts to see what the vendor should be doing. This will allow him to determine what to do next. Terminating the contract is not a good idea as Hugh does not know if the vendor is working to the terms of the contract or not. Asking the project team how the vendor is doing is not optimal as their perspective may not be accurate. Not all of the project team members are working with this specific vendor, though the four team members who have reported the issue should have some bearing. Looking for another vendor without understanding how this one is performing is not yet warranted.

Correct answer
Project performance appraisal

Individual assessment
Customer feedback
Overall explanation
A project performance appraisal will indicate that an individual requires more training. In a project performance appraisal, feedback is gathered from team members' supervisors that may point out a need for additional training. A team assessment will evaluate the effectiveness of the team, not an individual. An individual assessment is used to determine an individual's decision-making process, interactions with others, and how they prefer to be led. An individual assessment would not contain anything about an individual's skillset. While impactful, customer feedback would not be qualified enough to indicate an employee's need for training.

Lindsey is not familiar with this document and asks you what should be included. Which of the following elements are you least likely to tell her to include in the lessons learned document?
An overview or summary of the situation
The impact of any actions that were taken to correct the situation.
Correct answer
The names of the individuals who were at fault and how they were reprimanded.
Updates to the project documents.
Overall explanation
You should not include the names of individuals who were at fault in the lessons learned document. Their reprimand should certainly not be included, as that is likely a human resources violation. In addition, this is not good for team morale and will likely cause trust issues in the future. An overview or summary of the situation is included in the lessons learned documentation. The impact of any actions that were taken to correct the situation is included in the lessons learned documentation. Updates to the project documents are included in the lessons learned documentation.

As a project manager, you know that it is imperative to foster team development. Some of the team development happens naturally as the team works together, and there are other parts of team development the project manager can help accelerate. Which of the following statements regarding developing a team is false?
Developing a team results in a decreased turnover.
Correct answer
Developing a team is done once in the project's duration.
Developing a team leads to better teamwork.
Developing a team leads to growth in an individual's knowledge.
Overall explanation
Developing a team is an ongoing process that is performed throughout the project. The benefits of developing a team are a decreased turnover, an increase in an individual's skills, and better teamwork. Developing a team results in a decreased turnover is a valid statement about team development. Developing a team leads to better teamwork is a valid statement about team development. Developing a team leads to growth in an individual's knowledge is a valid statement about team development.

You are the project manager for your organization and have been working in that capacity for seven years. Your company has recently hired a new Chief Operating Officer. She has asked you to provide her with a list of organizational impediments as she is looking to make company improvements. Which of the following would be considered an organizational impediment?
The QA team now requires a new issue recording tool.
A coding audit will take place randomly to prevent software bugs from being delivered.
Correct answer
The office's internet is unreliable.
The CEO will now take the last Friday of the month off.
Overall explanation
An organizational impediment impacts an organization as a whole. The internet being out for the entire office is an example of an organizational impediment. The other impediments listed are examples of team impediments. These team impediments only impact a subset of the organization. The recording tool needed by the QA team only affects the QA team, so it is a team impediment. The coding audit only impacts the technical teams. The CEO's schedule only impacts a small subset of the organization.

You are the project manager of the HJ Project and a large portion of the project will be outsourced to the Munk Electric Corporation. Midway through contract negotiations, your project sponsor asks for the addition of a relatively small feature to the scope. You and the Munk Electric Corporation have agreed to the terms of the contract for the identified project work items and this change, albeit small, must be addressed. How should you proceed?
Email the contractor, letting them know that the scope has an addition.
Mention this scope addition in a call with the contractor after the contract has been signed.
Correct answer
Add the new item to the current set of objectives and adjust the contract price accordingly.
Tell the project sponsor that you cannot accommodate this addition to the scope.
Overall explanation
Because the contract is not finalized, but the terms have been agreed upon, it is best to issue a revised contract that should include this addition to the scope for the contractors to sign. The contractor is not obligated to perform the work if it is not clearly stated in the contract. Emailing the contractor is not the best choice as you need to finalize the contractual terms and price for the additional work item. Only mentioning it to the contractor in an email is not enough to ensure that the new scope is added. You should clearly state the expectation in a contract that both parties have signed. Bringing up changes to the scope in a meeting after the contract is not appropriate. Because the contract has not yet been signed, the project's scope can be changed, and the project sponsor's request should be accommodated.

Jesse's project is a multinational project with hundreds of stakeholders. There is not enough time for Jesse to meet with every stakeholder individually. Which stakeholder does Jesse make it the highest priority to meet?
Correct answer
An influential stakeholder who is resistant to the project.
The project sponsor who is very supportive of the project.
The engineers who will be completing the project work.
A new employee who requires technical training to contribute to the project.
Overall explanation
Jesse should prioritize meeting with the stakeholder who is resistant to the project. This individual influences the project and should be assured by Jesse that the project is successful. Negative influence has the potential to disrupt a project. Therefore, Jesse should meet with this stakeholder to prevent any disruption, learn why the stakeholder is resistant, and try to work with them. Because the project sponsor is already supportive, there is no need to invest much time meeting with this stakeholder right now. While the engineers' work is critical Jesse will not have time to meet with all stakeholders right now. The engineer is part of the project team, so Jesse will be meeting with them regularly throughout the project. The new employee may be important to the project team, but not as important as ensuring the buy-in of the influential stakeholder.

You are the project manager for a large manufacturer which has facilities in several countries. Management has come to you and asked you to provide mentorship to all project managers in each facility on the organizational best practices. Which of the following is an example of mentorship?
John's supervisor enrolls him in a course to learn a new programming language.
Jose attends an industry-wide conference hosted by PMI.
Correct answer
Brittany meets regularly with Beth to learn more about a career path in project management.
Sarah has been hired as an intern by a well-renowned business consultant.
Overall explanation
Keep in mind that mentorship leads to career clarity and confidence. Therefore, the best example of mentorship here is Brittany learning about Beth's project management career path. John learning a new programming language is an example of training, not mentorship. Training results in a unique skillset. Jose attending a PMI conference will likely result in him learning about an industry, but it is not personalized as mentorship. Sarah's internship will likely result in new knowledge for her, but we cannot assume that she will be mentored by the consultant who hired her.

Your PMO has tasked you with hiring a new project manager for the organization. They have asked that you specifically find someone with mentorship experience. What core competency deals most with mentorship?
Industry-specific skills
Correct answer
General management
Project management
Lengthy experience
Overall explanation
Mentorship is encompassed by general management. While other competencies can include mentorship, mentorship is a form of general management that is not constrained by industry, project management, nor years of experience. Industry-specific skills can be ideal for mentorship in a specific technology, but general management skills are the best option for this question. Project management can be ideal for mentorship, but mentorship can be broader than just project management. Lengthy experience does not necessarily translate to good mentoring.

Consider a large controversial project in your community. The project is favored by some citizens, while other people are against the project. The performing organization has put Jennifer as the project manager as she is well-versed in this type of project work. Jennifer is also considered to be an emotionally intelligent team leader. Which of the following conflict resolution techniques is Jennifer most likely to embody in this type of project work?
Correct answer
Smoothing
Withdrawal
Forcing
Compromising
Overall explanation
Emotionally intelligent leaders are more likely to use a smoothing conflict resolution technique. Smoothing involves making some concessions but focuses on an agreement. Jennifer will need to downplay the differences and uplay the commonalities among the stakeholders. Withdrawal means she will remove herself from the argument, which is a yield-lose approach to conflict resolution. Forcing means, she will utilize her authority and power to force decisions in the project which is a lose-lose approach to conflict resolution. Compromising means that both parties have to give up something in the confrontation and is considered a lose-lose approach to conflict resolution.

Jason is the project manager of a construction project, and he needs to ensure the project finishes on time as there is another project that the team must start on as soon as this project is complete. As part of his project strategy, Jason wants to improve his emotional intelligence while still rewarding the team for their hard work and keep them on track to deliver the project on time. What is the best way Jason can reward his team?
Promise his team a $500.00 bonus at the end of the project.
Correct answer
Gather the team and individually thank each team member for their important contributions.
Let the supervisors of each team member know how well each team member is doing.
Reward the top two contributors of the team with an early dismissal on Friday.
Overall explanation
Jason should gather the team and individually thank each team member and stress the importance of their contributions. This is a clear example of demonstrating emotional intelligence while praising and rewarding the team. While the team may like a bonus at the end, this is not demonstrative of emotional intelligence. The team's supervisors should know about their excellent work; however, this is not emotional intelligence on Jason's part. Rewarding a team subset is rarely a good idea and may cause conflict within the team and derail the project.

Jan is a humble introvert and a key performer for your team. She has recently delivered a critical software bundle to a client on time and under budget. The client is extraordinarily impressed with her work. As Jan's project manager, how should you praise her work in an emotionally intelligent way?
At the next team meeting, give Jan a round of applause.
Give Jan a $100 bonus for completing the project under budget.
Correct answer
Have a private meeting with Jan where you thank her and express to her the importance of her contributions.
Mention Jan's accomplishments in the employee newsletter.
Overall explanation
While all these options are nice ways to reward a high achiever, a project manager must be emotionally intelligent enough to understand how individual team members prefer to be rewarded. Jan being a humble introvert implies that she likely does not like public praise. Therefore, mentioning her in a public newsletter or in front of the entire team may cause her to feel uncomfortable. Putting Jan in the spotlight when you know she is an introvert may make her feel uncomfortable. Financial incentives are helpful, but these are not emotionally intelligent rewards. Understanding Jan's shy nature helps guide the project manager in praising her in a private discussion, which is the most appropriate reward for Jan.

Olivia is an IT project manager for a beauty consulting company. Due to COVID 19, the project team is now meeting entirely by virtual meetings. Some project team members are angry about meeting virtually and feel that face-to-face meetings would be better. What should Olivia do to address the conflict?
Ensure the team that virtual team meetings will continue until health officials confirm it is safe to gather in face-to-face environments.
Update the project team on what company policies are taking place to allow face-to-face meetings in the future.
Correct answer
Brainstorm with the team creative ways to ensure team engagement through virtual meetings until face-to-face meetings can resume.
Inform the team that everyone will follow safety guidelines, and virtual meetings will continue until further notice.
Overall explanation
Brainstorming with the team is an excellent way to engage the team and find new ways to overcome challenges. The continuation of virtual meetings is fine, but there must first be a resolution to the conflict. Company policies regarding virtual meetings are good, but this choice does not offer a current resolution to the issue. This choice is not the best answer as it does not address the current issue for resolution.

You are the leader of a successful project management group at your company. The project management group consists of consultant project managers who are opinionated and outspoken about their work. What type of leadership style would work best for this group?
The coaching leadership style is a leadership style dedicated to the ongoing development and growth of employees. As a coach for the project management group, this leadership style will work best for leading the group.
A transactional leadership style would work best for leading a group of project managers. The transactional leadership style encourages employees to enhance their performance by offering rewards and bonuses for high performance.
An autocratic leadership style is the best for leading a group of opinionated project managers. The autocratic leader focuses on results, which is what the group of project managers would appreciate.
Correct answer
The best leadership style to lead a group of high opinionated and strong-willed project managers is a hands-off approach that maintains a high level of confidence in their employees.
Overall explanation
A hands-off approach that puts trust in their project managers is the best approach to lead a group of project managers. The coaching leadership style is a leadership style dedicated to the ongoing development and growth of employees and is a fine choice, but a hands-off approach with a successful group of project managers is preferred. The transactional leadership style encouraging employees to enhance their performance by offering rewards and bonuses for high performance is not the best choice as the group is already successful. The autocratic leader tells the team what to do instead of allowing the successful group to be self-led.

Demands are never good choices for a project team, especially one that is already unmotivated and discouraged by the working conditions. Highlighting the benefits of the work that the team is doing for the agency is a motivational approach that would help this team.

Call a meeting with Brian and discuss that you would like to delegate some of his work to another developer because he has fallen behind for the last three sprints.
Correct answer
Schedule a meeting with Brian to determine why he keeps failing to complete his work during the assigned sprint and let him know how this impacts the project while brainstorming possible solutions to the problem.
Assign Brian to a new project team that has a light workload.
Allow Brian to improve his performance in the next sprint before discussing that he will be reassigned to a new project if his performance does not improve.
Overall explanation
The best approach is to schedule a meeting with Brian to determine why he is falling behind in getting the work done and what solutions can be put in place to solve the problem. The team could also bring this to light in a retrospective. Delegating some of Brian's work to another developer is not the best choice as you first need to determine what the problem is. There also may not be enough capable resources on the development team to do all of the assigned work. Assigning Brian to a new project team that has a light workload is not the best choice as Brian's skills may be required on the current project. Reassigning Brian to a new project if his performance does not improve does not resolve the problem or address how the required work will be completed in this project.

One of the team members had a disruptive argument with another team member during a weekly meeting. What does Ben do to resolve this conflict?
Pull the two team members aside after the meeting, determine the argument, and explain to them that they cannot be disruptive during the weekly meeting.
Meet with their manager and ask them to control their employees at the weekly meeting.
Ignore the argument since it did not jeopardize the timeline.
Correct answer
Stop the meeting, reinforce the rules, and address the issue immediately.
Overall explanation
The most correct answer is to stop the meeting and address the issue immediately. This provides an opportunity to reinforce that this type of behavior will not be allowed during any meeting because it is inappropriate and wastes time in the meeting. The disruption needs to be addressed immediately rather than allowing it to continue and then addressing the argument after the meeting. The project manager's responsibility is to facilitate meetings effectively rather than report these types of issues to management instead. A workplace may have policies or rules that govern what the project manager can do, but generally, the project manager does not allow arguments to disrupt meetings. Ignoring the argument since it did not jeopardize the timeline is not the best choice as it can make others uncomfortable, is rude, and takes time away from the value of the meeting.

During a planning meeting with the development team, the project manager conveys the importance of a clear vision. Which of the following best describes the importance of a clear vision in an agile release planning?
The release plan drives the product roadmap.
The product roadmap establishes iterations.
Correct answer
The product vision drives the product roadmap.
The release plan establishes a clear vision.
Overall explanation
In agile release planning, the product vision drives the product roadmap. A clear understanding of the product vision is needed to build a product roadmap. This allows specifications based on the vision and allows the roadmap decomposition into a backlog of smaller, concrete requirements. The release plan does not drive the product roadmap. The product roadmap can help predict the overall duration, but it is not very reliable as doing such. The release plan establishing a clear vision is somewhat true, but this is not the best choice presented.

Project performance
Attitudes of team members
Technical competencies
Correct answer
All the above
Overall explanation
The project management team should capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle, and promote working together interdependently in a mutual trust climate. Project performance is true because the team can rely on each other to do the work more accurately and efficiently. Attitudes of team members can be improved when they are culturally aware and reliant on each other in the project. Technical competencies is true as the team members can better communicate to learn new things about the technical aspects of the project.

Monica is a project manager for her organization and recently conducted some training sessions with the project team. After the training sessions were completed, Monica delivered a proficiency test that 90 percent of the team scored poorly on. The team's primary complaint was that they did not understand the content and that the delivery method was mainly conducted by watching a recorded video. What should Monica do to address these concerns?
Correct answer
Conduct a survey to determine each team member's preferred learning method and adjust the training delivery accordingly.
Have the team members retake the training and insist everyone pay attention this time.
Have 10 percent of the team deliver the training sessions to the 90 percent of the team that did poorly.
Have the training delivered in person instead of utilizing a recorded video.
Overall explanation
Everyone's learning style is different. The correct approach is to conduct a survey or questionnaire to determine each team member's learning styles. It would then be easier to develop practical training that meets each team member's needs. Retaking the training is not the best choice as the participants did not retain the information the first time. It may be that the training method was not effective for the topic. Having the 10 percent deliver the training to the remainder of the team can be seen as punitive. In addition, this answer assumes the 10 percent of the team can create and teach a class. Have the training delivered in person instead of utilizing a recorded video may be a good choice once Monica knows how team members prefer to learn, but this is not the best choice for the question.

What is the best way to communicate and track progress on this project?
Have daily meetings with the team members and have all team members update every day on all their assignments.
Have a daily standup where the team members report the status of their current tasks.
Correct answer
Have a weekly meeting where everyone provides an update on their tasks.
Have the team members send in their updates to a group email every day.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to have a daily standup where the team members report the tasks' status. The status should be short and concise – red, amber, or green could be implemented. Green means they are good, amber means they have identified a risk, and red means a problem that must be addressed. Effective standup meetings are imperative to the success of short projects. Updating the team on the status of all assignments would include assignments that are done or have not started, so this is not the most effective solution. A weekly meeting would not be as effective as a quick daily meeting as too much time may pass from week to week to respond to issues and risks. A group email can be messy to organize and may not follow a standard such as RAG rating.

Mike is a project manager for his organization. He has been assigned a new project that has a charter. During the resource planning, Joe consulted with the other project managers, and he posted the Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) results. There were a couple of resources that were not happy with their assessed skill level. What should Mike do to resolve this conflict?
Allow the resources to retake the assessment test.
Allow the resources to provide documentation that shows why their assessed level should be different.
Tell the resources that they received that assessment from prior work, and it will not be changed.
Correct answer
Continue assigning tasks as usual and modify the assessed skill level as the work progresses.
Overall explanation
The assessments were provided as part of the organizational process assessments (OPA) and are internal to the organization. The assessed skill level is how the organization perceives the skill level of the resource. Regardless of how the resource feels about the assessed level, the levels are changed based on performance. However, a note should be placed in the RBS showing where the resource feels they are more valuable as an asset than was assessed. Assessment of skills is based on team members' performance, not a performance test. Documentation is fine, but it is the actual performance of the team members' work in the past that is assessed. It is wise not to share assessment information to avoid this issue. It is best to be emotionally intelligent and not blunt with the team members when dealing with this issue. Explain how the assessment was created and the opportunities to improve upon the assessment in the current project.

Darlene has been a project manager over a sizeable project that encompasses a significant amount of 745 stakeholders. These stakeholders have been sending her team emails and calling to request information concerning the project's different aspects. During the morning standup, she discusses the importance of utilizing the communication management plan with her team. She also discusses less time-consuming channels of communication. Why is this important?
There is not any new information that can be provided to the stakeholders.
The project is almost complete, and the stakeholders are just concerned about not meeting deadlines.
Correct answer
The time devoted to the large quantity of responses is taking away from the time needed for the completion of the project.
She does not want to deal with the stakeholders and is finding ways to avoid them until the project is over.
Overall explanation
When the project charter is developed, it identifies the stakeholders. It also outlines the various roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, including communication. The communication management plan outlines how and when stakeholders will receive information and exceptions. If the project team uses their time to answer stakeholders' questions, they will have difficulty completing tasks needed to keep the project on time. By reviewing the plan with her team and stakeholders, the agreement boundaries can be defined. There may be new information for the stakeholders, but the correct communication channels should be employed. There is no evidence that the project is nearing completion. Regardless, the communications management plan addresses how stakeholder communication should be handled throughout the project. Dealing with stakeholder communication demands can be cumbersome, so the communications management plan should be reviewed and followed.

LYM Plastics Corporation has just established a Project Management Office (PMO). They have hired Daniel to be the new PMO director. As Daniel begins to develop teams for the PMO, he must ensure that the members understand the importance of building trust with stakeholders. Why is building stakeholder relationships and encouraging engagement a must for the newly established PMO?
Stakeholders hold power with management to have the PMO shut down.
Team members could benefit from socializing outside of work with other employees.
Correct answer
Team members and stakeholders have explicit and tacit knowledge. Creating an environment of trust would allow for this knowledge to be shared.
Daniel would look good in management's eyes if he developed a means for a reward for team members.
Overall explanation
While documentation of knowledge is essential, if team members and stakeholders develop a level of trust, then there is an excellent possibility that each person will share knowledge freely. Knowledge resides in people's minds. Documentation is valuable, but it does not always lend to the full meaning needed. Stakeholders can clarify and give insight into documentation. Trust and relationships are extremely important between team members and project stakeholders. It is unlikely that stakeholders hold the authority with management to shut down the newly formed PMO. In addition, this answer does not place trust in the stakeholders or create a spirit of cooperation. Team members benefiting from socializing outside of work with other employees may be a true statement, but this is not why good stakeholder relationships are needed. Daniel looking good in management's eyes is not a valid option that protects and promotes the projects, stakeholders, and the PMO.

Your team has begun to use focus groups, questionnaires, and interviews to determine the information needed from stakeholders on a new project. Once the team members gather the information, they will start brainstorming to understand and document the collected data. This method is known as
Tactical knowledge gathering
Data mining
Trust building
Correct answer
Data gathering
Overall explanation
Data-gathering is a technique that encompasses brainstorming, gathering information from focus groups and interviews, to name a few. When a team utilizes these avenues, they can gather information quickly to learn about perceived project risk, idea generation, analysis assumptions and constraints, approval criteria, and various other information for the stakeholders. This is done by speaking to the stakeholders directly and documenting the team's findings for future reference and discussion. Tactical knowledge gathering is not a valid project management term.

Management has informed you, the PMO director, that they have a one-year time frame to complete this project. To ensure that you have all aspects covered for stakeholders, what must your team do to determine that all objectives are met?
Have the team show you where they think the new building should be built.
Correct answer
Have your team begin the process of collecting requirements from stakeholders.
Verify what the weather is expected to be like around the time allotted for the building to start.
Voice all your concerns for this time frame to management, citing you are not sure they realize the constraints.
Overall explanation
Collection of requirements is where the process of determination of stakeholder needs is outlined. Those needs are then documented and managed to meet the objectives. This process's benefits are that it lays a foundational basis for defining the product scope and project scope. The location of the building is important, but you will need all the requirements in order to create and fulfill the project scope. Weather is an assumption, not a requirement for the project scope. Assumptions and constraints must be identified, but the best choice is first to identify the project requirements and build the project scope.

As a project manager, Isabella has learned that specific skills are vital to ensure a project's success. How does having soft skills, such as understanding how others work together and conflict management, benefit a project manager?
When a project manager has interpersonal skills, it makes them more appealing to management when applying for a job.
It allows project managers to ask for raises.
It shows project teams that the project managers can manipulate stakeholders, making it easier for them to complete tasks.
Correct answer
Working with people while balancing conflict and competing aspects of project stakeholders helps achieve consensus on project objectives.
Overall explanation
When a project manager can further the project objectives by utilizing a skill set that effectively helps team members and stakeholders build relationships, they are doing what is best for the project and ultimately best for the organization. Interpersonal skills are just one facet management considers when hiring project managers. Interpersonal skills behoove the project team to meet project goals, not just the project manager when asking for raises or promotions. Manipulation is never an admirable trait of the project manager. Interpersonal skills help the project manager and the project team (and stakeholders) work together to achieve the project's goals.

The most likely scenario is that they break down the large user story into segments that span releases, which they could not test until the end. Breaking down a user story into tasks has no bearing on how it fits into an iteration. There is no need to make a user story simpler as there is nothing wrong with a complicated user story, but the functionality will not be usable until all segments are complete.

Sarah is a scrum master assigned to an information technology-based company in California. She is responsible for delivering a significant software application that will enhance the user experience in grocery shopping. In a recent customer survey, 76 percent of clients expressed concern that the application had too many features and was difficult to use. What likely occurred because of this concern?
Ineffective use of the scaled agile framework (SAFe).
Correct answer
Failed to produce a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Did not create an effective stakeholder engagement plan.
The participating grocery stores did not make their requirements for the application clear.
Overall explanation
In this scenario, Sarah likely did not produce an MVP for her clients in regular sprints. As a result, she failed to capture the requirements of the most important stakeholder the customer. SAFe is used for scaling agile across organizations and is not relevant in this scenario. While a comprehensive stakeholder engagement plan may have prevented the situation, it is more suited for more traditional project management than agile methods. As the customer primarily measures value, they are ultimately the ones who decide how the application should be developed, not the grocery stores.

They can commit, as they expect the velocity to increase with each sprint.
They should add more team members to get it done in time.
The team should make this commitment, not him.
Overall explanation
After having one sprint with 30 points, they cannot assume that this should be expected after that. It could have been an anomaly, and velocity will normalize after several sprints. The team should not commit because they have only achieved 30 points once ever. The team should not add more team members just because of this request, as there’s no additional information indicating that it is needed. The team nor Thomas should commit.

Velma is a young project manager, and she is sifting through company manuals to determine what she can or cannot do on her first project. She is passionate about the health of her project team and all its stakeholders. As she is reading, she finds something essential. The company’s manual makes several references to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). Based on HIPAA, the company has many rules on handling the health information of the project team and stakeholders. In short, the company is very conservative in its approach to health information, who accesses it, and why. How should Velma categorize the HIPAA rules that she is reading and view them in the context of her project work?
Company policies that are negotiable
Correct answer
Compliance mandated by government law
Rules that are for other people
Not applicable since Velma does not work for a doctor
Overall explanation
Companies often create health records even if their primary focus is not in the healthcare field. HIPAA is a federal regulation and therefore falls into the category of compliance. While a company manual or rulebook may reference HIPAA, a company’s rules in an area like this should be focused on government compliance. If Velma views HIPAA as just another company rule, something that could be broken, she could expose her company to untold liability. Although it might be in a company manual and next to other company rules that may or may not be government-mandated, Velma must learn to spot obvious compliance issues such as HIPAA and know that they are for everyone. If Velma views HIPAA as not applicable because it is only a rule for doctors and nurses, she could expose her company to untold liability.

Karen’s team is now in their 7th sprint. In the first three sprints, the team completed 30, 40, and 45 points. Since that time, they have produced an average of 50 points for every sprint. They have 240 points remaining in their backlog. How many sprints will it take for them to complete the remaining work?
Six
Eight
Correct answer
Five
This cannot be determined without knowing the average of the last two sprints
Overall explanation
If the team has averaged 50 points a sprint for weeks, it is reasonable to assume it will remain at 50. 240/5 = 5 sprints. Six is an incorrect calculation for this answer. Eight is an incorrect calculation for this answer. There is no requirement about how a team determines its velocity.

Before taking any action, Cara should evaluate how the global supply shortage will impact Project H. Once she determines this, she can take appropriate action. Until Cara understands Project H's impact, hoarding supplies is not a good option. Until Cara understands Project H's impact, adjusting tasks is not a good option.

Jerry should review the behavior of the feature and determine if it does present a compliance risk. This will let Jerry take the next best step. Fixing the issue without understanding if it is a compliance risk is not the best step, as Jerry does not understand its impact.

Rose is an employee of a major technology company. According to the project schedule, the company is developing a new innovative product and is approximately 35 percent complete. While performing a regular audit of the work progress, Rose notices that some employees leave their work computers unlocked for their lunch breaks, which directly violates the company's Personal Identifiable Information (PII) requirements. In this scenario, what should Rose do?
Ignore the situation as it is not Roses' responsibility.
Notify the workers to return to their computers.
Correct answer
Notify the security manager immediately.
Document the incident in the Issue Log.
Overall explanation
The situation at hand is a safety issue that requires immediate attention. Rose should inform the security manager as it is their responsibility to prevent any unnecessary non-compliance issues. Ignoring the situation is not a valid answer as it does not address the problem. While telling the workers to return to their computers is an immediate response, Rose is not the workers' direct supervisor's so this is not her responsibility.

Project Spiders is a three-year project that will ensure that the organization adheres to new financial regulations. Project bulletproof is a one-year project that will protect the company against the risk of a lawsuit. What is the best way to determine which project will provide the company the most value?
No analysis is needed, as both projects must be done.
Whichever project receives the most support from the company’s board.
Correct answer
Calculate the net present value of both and choose the one with the higher NPV.
Calculate the forecast revenues for both and choose the one with the highest forecast revenues.
Overall explanation
Net present value allows you to calculate the value of a project in today’s terms, regardless of the project length and is the best choice for comparing the value of projects. Avoiding analysis will not determine the greatest value. Having the board vote is not an agile best practice. Calculating future revenues does not tell us a project’s value at a single point in time, which would include the deduction of costs and the time value of money which is part of NPV.

The result of seven measurements in a row on one side of the mean in a control chart is called the Rule of Seven. This is an assignable cause. The Rule of Seven is why it is out of control, so C is the best answer. “Within control” means that the result of one measurement stayed within the control limits. The Rule of Seven does not always signal quality improvement. It could, in some instances, signal that the mean is set too low for the project.

You are the project manager of a large project that will last several years, and your budget is extremely tight. You have another business that sells computer parts via the Internet. Although your company has a policy against conflict of interests in procurement, you know that you can save the project thousands of dollars by the company purchasing the equipment through your website, because you would sell the equipment for 1 percent above your costs. No one within the company would know you are involved in the purchase if you do not say anything. What should you do?
Buy from your business so the project can save thousands of dollars.
Buy from yourself if management approves the decision.
Correct answer
Do not influence the decision for personal profit.
Allow several vendors, including your company, to bid on the sale and go with the lowest vendor.
Overall explanation
The project manager cannot—must not—influence the decision for personal profit. This decision is a clear conflict of interest and goes against your company’s policies. You should not approach management with this decision—a policy already exists against this activity. Even though you know that your company will likely have the lowest cost, this is inappropriate.

Some of the end-users are critical of the update because they are worried about a few things: where the data is stored, future access to the data, and their mapped drives. She has informed all users that the server update will change how they access their files and home folders in the future. Now, a bunch of end users have gone to their functional managers to complain about the change. In this situation, the end-users are what type of stakeholders?
Unresponsive
Correct answer
Negative
Uninformed
Low influence/low interest
Overall explanation
The correct answer is negative. The end-users here are negative stakeholders, meaning they do not want Stella's project to be successful or even exist at all. Unresponsive is not a correct description for stakeholders. In describing a stakeholder's attitude towards the project, this is not the correct terminology. An uninformed stakeholder is one who is not aware of the project; Stella would have to inform them about the project and how it might affect them.

Several stakeholders noted by the functional managers have concerns regarding the deployment and how it will affect the company's productivity. The project sponsor, Avi, asks Miriam to create a diagram that, based on the stakeholders' power in the company, details which stakeholders can affect the project the most. What kind of chart should Miriam create?
Correct answer
Power/influence diagram
Tornado diagram
Pareto diagram
Ishikawa diagram
Overall explanation
The correct answer is Miriam should create a power/influence diagram, which defines the correlation between power over the project and influence over the project for each key stakeholder. For instance, a stakeholder with a lot of power and influence needs to be monitored more closely than a stakeholder with less power and influence. A power/influence diagram prioritizes project stakeholders and allows the team to create a stakeholder management strategy better. The other responses are incorrect. A tornado diagram shows the forces for a decision and against the decision. A Pareto diagram details the organized defect distribution as a result of quality control. An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone or cause-and-effect diagram, is used to nail down casual elements contributing to a project effect. You will see Ishikawa diagrams are primarily used in quality control.

Some stakeholders might just remain unhappy.
Correct answer
She must explain what the project benefits are.
Put these stakeholders in the “resistant” category.
She should ignore the stakeholders’ complaints.
Overall explanation
The correct answer is that Monica must explain to the stakeholders what the project benefits are. She should also inform them how the project will help the Morgan Corporation, and the people affected. Some stakeholders may indeed just be unhappy, but the attempt should be made to address their concerns and needs. It may be appropriate to put stakeholders in the “resistant” category, but the categorization of them does nothing to engage them or respond to their complaints.

Pull communications
Push communications
Interactive communications
Correct answer
Ad hoc communications
Overall explanation
Ad hoc communications is not a type of structured stakeholder management communication and is the correct answer. Project managers use ad hoc communications to facilitate quick, informal communications, but they are not a structured, formal, or planned approach to manage communication between stakeholders. Pull communications, such as information from a project’s website, are a form of planned, structured communications. An e-mail or memo sent to a project stakeholder is a push communication and is a structured approach to stakeholder management communication.

An impediment has been identified regarding the transportation of supplies from the supplier to the work site involving available delivery dates within the time frame for completion. What is the best option for Mario to avoid a delay?
Submit a change request that switches the schedule baseline to show the delay caused by the impediment.
Recommend the team find another supplier that can meet the timeline even if it means additional cost.
Take on the supplier himself to ensure that there are no delays no matter what it takes. Because he is the project manager, he is ultimately responsible for any situations that could delay project completion.
Correct answer
Have the team members use collaboration techniques to clear the impediment.
Overall explanation
The team can work together by pairing, swarming, or mobbing to develop a solution that keeps the project within budget and on time. While this may be a viable solution in some projects, it is not the best choice presented. If some additional costs and logistics must be adjusted for a new supplier, then the changes could cause the project not to be completed in the manner it initially outlined in the requirements.

June decides that she will award one team member the title of "Team Member of the Month." This person will get to park in a reserved parking space and will receive one paid day off from the project. What is the danger in June's plan for rewards and recognition?
There is no danger. This is an example of a reward and recognition system.
Only project team members who have activities during the month can be awarded the title.
Correct answer
Only one team member can be awarded the title per month.
The project manager chooses the team member, not the project team.
Overall explanation
This is an example of a zero-sum reward. Only one team member can be awarded the title. This is an example of a zero-sum reward. This answer choice does not fully answer the question. This is not the issue; regardless of who chooses the reward, only one team member can receive the award.

Jerry has been assigned to a team that is working on the development of a new mobile application. While Jerry is familiar with agile project management methodologies such as Kanban boards, his team consists of individuals who only know how to conduct waterfall methods. What action should Jerry take next to address these shortcomings?
Encourage the team to learn about agile project management during their spare time.
Correct answer
Facilitate agile project management training for the rest of the team.
Talk about agile project management during the daily standup meeting.
Review agile project management during the sprint retrospective.
Overall explanation
As Jerry is familiar with agile project management, he can facilitate training for his team. Alternatively, he can arrange a workshop for his team to attend. Encouraging the team to learn about agile project management during their spare time is not the best course of action as the team members will not receive the hands-on training they should receive from the actual project. Daily standup meetings are typically 15 minutes long and are used to discuss the team's work for the day. Sprint retrospectives are an opportunity for the scrum team to inspect and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint.

Otto is new to your scrum team. He has never worked in a scrum environment and is wondering how impediments are typically prioritized. What are you most likely to tell him?
Impediments are addressed in the order that they arise.
Impediments are addressed in the duration order, where impediments that take less time to address are first.
Correct answer
The scrum team analyzes impediments, and the most impactful impediments are addressed first.
Every impediment is addressed in the subsequent release period after reviewing the impediments in the retrospective meeting.
Overall explanation
Impediments should be analyzed by the team, who should prioritize the work along as a team. Then the scrum master should take over the responsibility for ensuring that it is addressed. Note that the team is not responsible for solving the impediment; they are responsible for assessing the impact, affecting how an impediment is prioritized. The team should not address impediments in the order that they arise because critical impediments come up and cannot be sent to the bottom of the backlog to be addressed in the future. The team should not address impediments based on duration because critical impediments come up and cannot be sent to the bottom of the backlog to be addressed in the future. A critical impediment may present itself. You cannot address it later because it takes longer than less critical impediments, which is also true of addressing impediments in the subsequent release iteration. Sometimes impediments may need to be addressed when they are found; other times, it may be appropriate to wait to address an impediment after several months or maybe even accept the impediment and do nothing about it.

Heather, a scrum master for Project Z, is approached by the product owner. The product owner mentions that they have noticed Heather frequently coordinating activities, clearing conference rooms, and performing other activities they believe the project team should perform. The product owner asks Heather why she performs these activities. How should Heather respond?
Correct answer
Let the product owner know about the concept of servant leadership.
Complain to the project manager that the project team refuses to perform these actions.
Direct the product owner to read the team's ground rules.
Tell the product manager to perform these activities in the future.
Overall explanation
This stakeholder likely is unfamiliar with the concept of servant leadership. Letting them know that a servant leader puts themselves in the team's service will help explain Heather's actions. These actions align with servant leadership, so the team likely is not refusing to perform them. Ground rules refer to acceptable behavior, e.g., how to communicate updates or behave in meetings. Telling the product owner to perform these actions will not help them understand the reason for doing them.

Denise is a scrum master at Acme Corporation. Initial planning and high-level scoping have been completed for Project G. Denise would now like to acquire a team for this project. What should Denise do next?
Ask stakeholders to volunteer team members.
Ask people she worked with before to join the team.
Do nothing. Stakeholders will provide a team for her.
Correct answer
Analyze the initial plan and determine the skill sets needed.
Overall explanation
Before Denise can acquire project resources, she needs to understand what competencies and skills are required for success. Once this is completed, she may begin finding a team. Without knowing what skills are needed, volunteers are not helpful. Asking people she has worked with before to join the team will not provide Denise with the necessary skills.

Consider a new project team led by an experienced project manager. The project manager needs to coach the team to ensure they understand what the project requires and how the work should be completed. Which one of the following is the most valuable approach to working with this new team to ensure they understand how the project will operate and how to achieve the value the project aims to create?
Rely on the staffing management plan
Discuss the resource management process 
Create a RACI chart with the project team
Correct answer
Utilize the team development processes
Overall explanation
The best choice is to utilize the team development processes. This answer includes team building, training, and working with the team to establish ground rules for the project. This is the best choice for a new project team to get the project moving in a good direction. The staffing management plan does not create the needed direction and edification required by the project team. The resource management process is not the best choice. Resource management describes how resources, both human and physical resources, are utilized in the project. A RACI chart is a good activity to do with the project team, but for a new team to focus on value, it is best to first work on team development activities.

Determine activities that the team should undertake to gain quick improvements to the stakeholder's sentiment.
Determine long-term issues and concerns related to the stakeholder's sentiments, update the issues log, and conduct a risk analysis.
Correct answer
Review and update the stakeholder engagement plan.
Update the risk management plan.
Overall explanation
The project manager should review and update the stakeholder engagement plan to ensure it meets the stakeholder's needs. The team should determine activities they should undertake to gain quick improvements to the stakeholder's sentiment and long-term issues.

Elizabeth is a project team member, and she does not want to complete the lessons learned documentation on this project. Elizabeth does not see the value in the documentation or the process. What is the point of the lessons learned documentation?
It keeps the project manager focused on the project work.
It maintains communication with management.
It ensures that all the project work is complete.
Correct answer
It enables other project managers to learn from this project.
Overall explanation
Lessons learned are documents used for future reference, and they enable other project managers to learn from the current project. The project plan and scope statement, not the lessons learned documentation, keep the project manager focused on the project work. Various reports are used to communicate with management, but not lessons learned documentation. This is not to say that management would not review the lessons learned documentation; it is not the best answer for the question. Management will inspect reports and other communications to keep them informed. Lessons learned do not ensure that the project work is complete.

Perform a Monte Carlo analysis.
Meet with stakeholders.
Update the information radiators.
Correct answer
Hold a sprint retrospective.
Overall explanation
A retrospective should be held at the end of every iteration, and this will allow the project team to improve and learn from the prior iteration. There is no need for a Monte Carlo simulation at this time. While meeting with stakeholders seems like a good idea, the best answer is to move into the sprint retrospective.

Reset the backlog to how it was before.
Speak to the product owner.
Correct answer
Ensure the project team is aware of the reprioritized tasks.
Complain to his manager.
Overall explanation
Backlog changes are common in agile projects, so Oscar should ensure his team that he is aware of their slated work updates. Resetting the backlog is not ideal as the product owner ultimately decides on priority. Speaking to the product owner will not help ensure his team is aware.

One of the primary requirements for this project is that the new product must be completely documented for training and ongoing maintenance. Eighteen people are working on this new project. What is the best way to communicate and track progress on this project?
Have daily meetings with the team members and have all team members update every day on all their assignments.
Correct answer
Have a daily standup where the team members report the status of their current tasks.
Have a weekly meeting where everyone provides an update on their tasks.
Have the team members send in their updates to a group email every day.
Overall explanation
The best answer is to have a daily standup where the team members report the tasks' status. The status should be short and concise – red, amber, or green could be implemented. Green means they are good, amber means they have identified a risk, and red means a problem that must be addressed. Effective standup meetings are imperative to the success of short projects. Updating the team on the status of all assignments would include assignments that are done or have not started, so this is not the most effective solution. A weekly meeting would not be as effective as a quick daily meeting as too much time may pass from week to week to respond to issues and risks. A group email can be messy to organize and may not follow a standard such as RAG rating.

Ben is the scrum master for a software development team. Sprints are conducted in four-week intervals to produce a minimum viable product (MVP). Historically, the development team has had issues with implementing software features as they do not communicate well. Ben’s team is conducting a sprint retrospective to determine what actions can be taken to increase the next sprint’s productivity. What is the most likely reason why the software features do not communicate well?
Ben is too focused on preventing external distractions.
The sprints are not long enough for the team to develop MVPs.
Ben is not involved enough in developing the software.
Correct answer
Each team member is working in a silo.
Overall explanation
A key aspect of agile project teams is their ability to take on generalized specialists, who are individuals with one or more technical specialties and who have learned to be productive in other team roles. In this scenario, each team member is likely working in a silo because the software features are not communicating with each other. The team should be working with each other every step of the way to ensure the features’ proper functionality. As the scrum master, Ben’s responsibility is to ensure external distractions are not interfering with the team’s daily processes. While the sprint duration could be too short, there is not enough information to suggest this is the team’s primary concern. The scrum master is responsible for ensuring the scrum process is used as intended, enforces the rules, and removes impediments to the team’s ability to deliver the sprint goal. Ben is not responsible for developing the software himself.

The new website must incorporate best practices from your competitors and be subject to change as new trends emerge. Which of the following methodologies would be best used in this scenario?
Predictive/plan-driven
Iterative
Incremental
Correct answer
Agile
Overall explanation
Agile methodologies are best suited for projects where changes are relatively easy and waste is not costly. Additionally, these methodologies work for projects in a complex environment where the end product is not fully known, and user feedback is precious. Predictive is resistant to change, so this is not the best choice presented. Iterative means the approach moves through iterations. Agile is the best choice presented. Incremental means the approach moves through increments. Agile can use iterative and incremental depending on the nature of the work and the flavor of agile selected.

Robin has been tasked with the construction of a more sustainable building. This building must adhere to recent legislation that mandates that the energy output cannot exceed a certain amount of pollution based on a monthly inspection. Which of the following methodologies would be best used in this scenario?
Correct answer
Predictive
Iterative
Incremental
Agile
Overall explanation
Predictive projects are ideal for projects where change is not easy, up-front planning is required, and stakeholders want a defined project scope. Construction projects often use predictive project management. Iterative projects use iterations to create versions of the product deliverable, something that would not be effective in a construction project. Incremental projects create increments, such as new versions of software, to complete a project. This approach would not be ideal for a construction project. Not all projects are suited for agile.

Overall explanation
The communications management plan determines who gets what information when needed and in what modality the information is expected. All stakeholders likely will not need the project closure report. Consider a large project that affects a community not everyone in the community needs or wants the report. The project sponsor may need a copy of the report, but option D answers the question better.

Jimmy is a project manager at Water Corporation, which is looking to deploy a new app to connect writers with publishers. During a recent meeting with stakeholders, he was asked the best way for this project to provide value to Water Corporation incrementally. What is the best option for Jimmy to select?
Correct answer
Use agile to deploy small deliverables regularly.
Use a hybrid model to plan big chunks but easily adjust scope.
Use a predictive model to plan out the project fully.
Conduct a Monte Carlo analysis to determine the optimal development path.
Overall explanation
Agile methodology is the most appropriate response as it will provide value incrementally throughout its life cycle. This is especially true in cases where the scope may rapidly shift. A hybrid approach incorporates both waterfall and agile aspects but is not as consistent in its delivery of value as pure agile. Waterfall operates in larger phases but is not necessarily incremental. A Monte Carlo analysis is used to examine the impact of variables on an outcome.

Correct answer
Budget as best you can at the start, and adjust as you go.

A user story is a way of stating a requirement. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. Its purpose is to articulate how a feature or function will provide value to the customer. In short, a user story describes the type of user, what they want, and why.

In this scenario, both the team members have different interpretations of the customer's product description, which is the definition of a gulf of evaluation. While the scenario may seem to point to the Definition of Done, the disagreement itself is not an example of that concept.

You want to capture the correct information when changes are presented and analyzed for your project. Which one of the following must be completed for each change that is proposed for a project?
The project charter must be examined.
The project life-cycle costs must be reviewed.
Correct answer
The change must be reviewed for any associated risks.
The benefit/cost ratio must be reviewed.
Overall explanation
Integrated change control calls for all of the knowledge areas, including risks, to be reviewed for the impact of the proposed change. The charter does not have to be examined. The life-cycle costs concern the cost of the project's deliverable once it is in production. In some instances, life-cycle costing may be appropriate, but not in every instance of a change request.

During the original conversation about the change, the stakeholder wanted to perform a cost-benefit analysis, and he reported the results to you. What is your response?
The change was not needed.
The change would have cost too much.
The change would have taken too long to deliver.
Correct answer
The change request was never documented or entered into integrated change control.
Overall explanation
All changes should be formally documented in the project, even if they were stated in a conversation. The project manager should have followed up on the change request, documented it, and entered it into integrated change control.

Your project sponsor has asked you to review some of the risks of the project with him. In particular, the project sponsor wants to define some of the root causes of risks. Which component will help you, the project manager, identify the root causes of risk?
The project team
Expert judgment
Project scope
Correct answer
Risk register
Overall explanation
The risk register includes the root causes of risk. The project team may contribute to the root-cause analysis, but the risk register is the component that stores the root cause of identified risk. Experts may contribute to the root-cause analysis, but the risk register is the component that stores the root cause of identified risk. The project scope does not contribute to or supply the root cause of risks.

You are the project manager for your organization. Marcy, the project sponsor, has asked that you use a different grade of materials for your project. She believes the current materials used are of lesser quality than the materials she proposes. The customer demands the highest quality on the project deliverable. This change in materials will cause the project costs to increase by 20 percent. Which one of the following best describes the cost of the materials?
Gold plating
Correct answer
Cost of quality
The project management cost
Discretionary costs
Overall explanation
The cost of quality is the best choice. The expense of the better materials is attributed to the better product the project will create, which meets the customer’s demands. Gold plating is the act of adding work, materials, or more expensive than needed materials to drive up the project cost for personal gain. This is not an example of project management costs. These are not discretionary costs but costs attributed to the cost of the quality as demanded by the customer.

Protecting the project scope is paramount in all projects, but sometimes changes will happen. In which of the following is the project scope change control documented?
Correct answer
The project scope management plan
The quality management plan
The change control board documentation
The project charter
Overall explanation
The project scope change control is documented in the project scope management plan. The quality management plan addresses the quality of the project, not the process for controlling changes. This is not a valid answer to this question. The project charter authorizes the project and does not address the process for managing changes.

Dean’s company uses ISO 9000 standards as part of its manufacturing environment. Dean has been asked to incorporate an ISO 9000 approach into his projects. What is ISO 9000?
A quality management system
A quality control system
A management approach to implement quality on customer projects
Correct answer
A method of following procedures created internally to an organization
Overall explanation
ISO 9000 is a method of following procedures created internally by an organization. ISO 9000 is not a quality management system. ISO 9000 is not a quality control system. ISO 9000 is an organization-wide approach, not just a project-centric one.

Question 124
Skipped
You are the project manager for a construction project. One of the identified risks within the project has a 20 percent chance of happening. If the risk occurs, it will cost your project an additional $150,000. Given this, what is the contingency amount you will need for this risk event?
$150,000
Correct answer
$30,000
$75,000
Zero. The risk is not real until it occurs.
Overall explanation
The risk has a 20 percent chance of happening and will cost the project $150,000. Twenty percent of $150,000 is $30,000—the expected amount of contingency. $150,000 is 100 percent of the risk event occurring. $75,000 is based on a 50 percent likelihood of the risk occurring. The risk is real even if the risk event does not occur.

Question 125
Skipped
You are the project manager for a large project that spans several of your organization’s sites. There are many risks identified throughout the project in each of the locations of the project. Which one of the following is the most effective method of dealing with the project risks?
Correct answer
Create risk owners for each of the project risks.
Buy insurance for each of the identified risks.
The project manager will need to travel to each site as the risk event is coming into the project schedule.
The project manager will need to schedule the risk events so that no risk events overlap at any one time.
Overall explanation
Risk owners can monitor, respond, and communicate on risk events. Buying insurance, also known as transference, may not be an affordable or available solution for all the risks within the project. Multiple risks may overlap each other in the schedule, making this unfeasible. In addition, the project manager’s presence would not address the risk event itself. This option is not feasible. A project may have multiple risks on multiple paths, and it would be highly unlikely for the project manager to schedule activities to avoid overlapping those with risks.

Joanna is the project manager for project ICS, and Marcy is the project manager for project FSL. Both projects have similar objectives that benefit the development department of their firm. Gary, the program manager, oversees each project. A portion of Joanna's project is experiencing delays that harm some resource availability requirements for Marcy's project. Who should be responsible for managing this issue?
Joanna is responsible because her project is causing a negative impact
Marcy is responsible because she needs to adapt her project to the impact.
Correct answer
Gary is responsible because he oversees both projects, and the related projects are impacted.
The portfolio manager is responsible because the related programs are impacted.
Overall explanation
The projects are related, so Gary, the program manager, is responsible for managing this issue with the project managers. Programs are composed of related projects and have oversight of project issues, management, and decisions. Joanna is independently accountable for her project; however, the program manager is responsible for the interconnected projects in this scenario. Marcy is independently responsible for her project; however, the program manager is responsible for the interconnected projects in this scenario. The portfolio manager is not responsible because there are not interrelated programs in this example; there are interrelated projects.

Carly was recently hired at an IT consulting firm where she is implementing an agile project management approach. The company that hired Carly did not reveal to her that they use a project management office with rigid rules and requirements for all projects. The project management office assigns the project managers their projects and directs them on requirements for managing the projects. Additionally, the project management office is directly responsible for every project's success. Therefore, the management office can also exert control over the projects. What kind of project management office does Carly's firm demonstrate?
Controlling
Supportive
Correct answer
Directive
Portfolio
Overall explanation
Carly's office is an example of a directive project management office. A directive project management office is rigid and is responsible for the success of all projects. A controlling project management office exerts a moderate level of control but is not accountable for the success of projects. A supportive project management office provides OPAs and consultation for projects but has a very low level of control over projects. A portfolio is not a kind of project management office but describes the collection of projects, programs, operations, and investments within an organization.

Chris works in a project management office that is very hands-off. He meets with the project management office when he needs training on certain project management practices or requires access to a project artifact template. The project management office does not have any control over the outcomes or success of Chris's projects. The project management office can consult on projects if Chris needs help but is generally hands-off when it comes to management. What kind of project management office does Chris's office have?
Controlling
Correct answer
Supportive
Directive
Laisse-faire
Overall explanation
This scenario describes a supportive project management office. A supportive project management office provides tools, templates, software, and consultation for projects but has a very low level of control over projects. A controlling project management office exerts a moderate level of control but is not accountable for the success of projects. A directive project management office is rigid and is responsible for the success of all projects. Laisse-faire is not a type of project management office, so this choice is incorrect.

You are managing a technical project for your organization, and your team identified a project risk that the vendor may not be able to deliver servers on time. The vendor reports they will be late delivering the servers to your site by two weeks. The delay of the servers will cause a halt in project progress as the project work requires the servers to be installed and functioning by a specific date. What should you do next?
Alert the project sponsor about the delay.
Correct answer
Implement the risk management plan.
Document the issue in the issue log and assign an issue owner.
There is nothing you can do as this is an external risk.
Overall explanation
The primary purpose of an issue log is to track issue resolution. The issue log assigns an issue owner responsible for resolving or maintaining an issue and conveying the issue's status to relevant stakeholders. When a risk happens, it becomes an issue and should be documented in an issue log. You should alert the project sponsor about the delay and offer some solution on how the issue will be managed, but you should first update the issue log. Implementing the risk management plan is not the correct choice; you may implement risk responses, but not the actual plan for managing, assessing, and responding to risk events. This is an external risk, but there is always something you can do, such as, at a minimum, updating the issue log.

Doug, one of the team members, is in charge of installing a machine for the project that must be balanced within .03 millimeters, or it will not function properly. Doug will be using a tool that measures the vibrations in the machine that may cause the imbalance. If the machine is not installed by next Monday, it will cause a delay in the project as the other equipment in the project's queue are dependant on this task. What term describes the installation of this piece of equipment in relation to the downstream activities?
Risk triggers
Issues
Correct answer
Hard logic
Float
Overall explanation
When activities must be completed in a particular order, such as in this scenario, you are dealing with hard logic, also called mandatory dependencies. Risk triggers will alert the team when a risk is about to become an issue. Issues are risk events that have occurred in the project. Float describes the opportunity to delay an activity without affecting the start date of successor activities.

A stakeholder on your project emails you a request that the grade of material used in manufacturing is not as optimal as it could be. In reviewing project assumptions, scope, and quality documents, you find that the grade of the material is, in fact, acceptable to the sponsor. What should you do next?
Do nothing because the current grade of the material is acceptable.
Note this information in the risk register because it may cause problems with the project.
Correct answer
Add this information to the issue log.
Alert the sponsor to this feedback.
Overall explanation
The project manager should note the information in the issue log. The issue log serves to record anything that comes up in the project that there may not be complete alignment or that may pose a problem in the future. Doing nothing with the information is not respectful to the needs of the stakeholder who voiced this information. Noting this in the issue log ensures the stakeholder that their concerns are heard. This information should not be in the risk register because there is no reason to note this as a risk. The grade is acceptable per project assumptions, scope, and quality. The sponsor already mentioned that the grade is acceptable, so there is no need to alert the sponsor.

During this training, Marvin is helping you add some entries to the lessons learned documentation for a project you are closing. Marvin asks you when the lessons learned documentation should be updated. Which of the following choices would be the best response?
The lessons learned document should be updated at the end of the project in the closing phase.
The lessons learned document should be updated in the retrospective meetings.
Correct answer
The lessons learned document should be updated throughout the project.
The lessons learned document should be updated when there is an update made to the issue log.
Overall explanation
The lessons learned register is a living document that should be updated throughout the project. There is no predetermined point at which this document should be updated. In project closing, you should finalize the lessons learned documentation, but lessons learned should be maintained throughout the project, not just at the end. The lessons learned document can be updated following a retrospective meeting if there is cause for an update. However, the best choice is that a lessons learned document should be updated throughout the project. The lessons learned document can be updated when an update is made to the issue log if there is a cause.

Jenny is a project manager at Berry Corporation, which is planning a new program of related projects. Some of the projects in the program are similar to past projects completed by Jenny in the organization. Jenny elects to use the past projects to predict the current cost of the new projects. What cost estimating approach is she most likely using in this scenario?
Bottom-up
Correct answer
Top-down
Parametric
Triangular
Overall explanation
Top-down estimating, also known as analogous estimating, predicts current costs based on past projects. Bottom-up estimating is used for projects that have no similar projects. The project starts at zero and accounts for the full cost of the project. This is also known as a definitive estimate. Parametric projects utilize a parameter, such as cost per unit, to predict costs. Triangular is the average estimate of optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic. It is also known as a three-point estimate.

Indy is the project manager for Project Yellowstone, eight weeks into a planned fifteen-week implementation, one week behind schedule, and has a CPI of .95. Indy has been closely monitoring one specific task that presented a significant risk to his project. The risk has a probability of .45 and an impact of $120,000. What is the amount that should be in the contingency reserve for this risk event?
$120,000
Correct answer
$54,000
$60,000
$95,000
Overall explanation
To find this answer, you should take the probability times the impact, which is $120,000 times .45, for a value of $54,000. $120,000 is the entire risk exposure. $60,000 is not a valid calculation for this scenario, so this choice is incorrect. $95,000 is not a valid calculation for this scenario, so this choice is incorrect.

Do nothing; the risk owner should take over.
Alert the project team.
Correct answer
Add the risk to the risk register.
Escalate the issue to the product owner.
Overall explanation
Larry should add the risk to the risk register before taking any additional action. Risk owners are closest to the risk event and are empowered to act if the risk appears to be occurring. Doing nothing is not the best choice. Alerting the project team is not the best choice as the team has identified the risk event. Escalating the issue is not the best answer as issues are negative risk events that have occurred. This positive risk has not yet occurred in the project.

Today, the vendor reports that they have finalized a large portion of the contracted work and they would like to go over the completed items with George. In addition to checking their work, what else should George do?
Correct answer
Ensure appropriate knowledge transfers have occurred.
Release the vendor from their contract.
Refer the vendor to another client.
Update organizational process assets.
Overall explanation
Before the vendor finalizes their work, George should ensure they have transferred any appropriate knowledge to the project team. This will help ensure the team is able to improve and use the vendor's deliverables. George should not release the vendor as they have completed a large portion of the project work but have not completed all of the contracted work.

Last week, however, Corey, a developer on the project, has left the project and the organization. Sarah, a new developer, joins the team and company today. The team is worried that Sarah may take too long to figure things out and get up to speed on the project. What should Nicole do in this situation?
Update the project velocity to account for the new employee's learning curve.
Make certain Sarah understands the project and has read the project plan.
Correct answer
Assign Sarah a partner to coach her in the project work.
Ask Corey if Sarah can contact him with any questions about his past work.
Overall explanation
The best choice presented is to partner Sarah with another developer on the project team to coach her on the project work. This will help with the learning curve and welcome Sarah to the team. Updating the project velocity is not the best choice as there is no evidence yet that the velocity has changed due to adding the new team member and Corey's departure from the project. Because this is an agile project there is no formal project management plan for Sarah to read, making this choice incorrect. It is not appropriate to ask Corey to take calls and answer Sarah's questions when Corey is no longer an employee of the organization.

Overall explanation
Zachary should ensure the new team member knows the rest of the project team and that everyone on the team clearly understands their responsibilities. This will help integrate them and get them up to speed. Generally, the team members do not attend steering committee meetings.

Martin, the CIO, is topically aware of agile but requested weekly status reports and copies of the project plan. Jolene explains that these items are not part of agile as documentation in agile has little value. Which one of the following items could Jolene share with Martin to show how well the team is progressing with the project requirements and accomplishing value for the organization?
Cost burndown chart
Correct answer
Burndown chart
Information radiator
Bubble chart
Overall explanation
The best choice is the burndown chart for the project. A burndown chart shows how many requirements, in story points, are left in the queue. It will also show how many story points have been completed per iteration. Burndown charts can be used for the entire project and for the sprint backlog. A cost burndown chart is not something used in agile projects, so this choice is incorrect. An information radiator is a central place, such as a wall in the project area, where the project information on progress is shared. The information radiator can include burndown charts, goals for the project, and other project information that is openly shared with others. A bubble chart is a risk analysis chart where the size and location of bubbles in the chart represent the size and severity of an identified risk.

Overall explanation
The stakeholder register is the first document updated as soon as stakeholders are identified. Communication reports are not updated first. Documents such as status reports, exception reports, and other project reports may not necessarily be given to external stakeholders.

While reviewing the other phases of the project, Jess realizes she does not have a way to know when a specific phase is complete. Jess needs a definitive answer for when a phase is complete so that other teams can start their work based on what her project has accomplished. What should Jess do next?
Do nothing. Once the phase begins, Jess will have a better idea of when it is complete.
Ask her project team to define the end of a phase when they reach it.

Jess should work with her stakeholders to ensure objective ways to determine when each phase is complete, which can then be used to sign off on a phase. Doing nothing risks the project not completing a phase and is not a good plan for the other teams contingent on Jess’s project’s work. The project team can offer insight, but the end of the phase should be identified as part of planning, not just when the team is approaching the end of the work.

Amanda is the scrum master for Project DBA, which recently had its final deliverable signed off by the product owner and steering committee. Amanda and the project team have completed documenting their lessons learned, and the product owner has transitioned the product to the operations team. What steps are left in this project’s lifecycle?
Correct answer
Release the project team.
Begin support planning.
Assign the project team to monitor the operations team.
Closeout of the remaining tasks.
Overall explanation
Once everything has been signed off and the product transitions to the final customer, Amanda should release the project team back to their functional team or the next project. Unless support planning is part of Project U, this is not necessary. The project team would not monitor the operations team as the project is now closed. Once the final customer accepts the product, the project team is done; there should not be any remaining tasks.

Chris is a scrum master for the ABC project, and the team is completing their sprint backlog of software development. The team has not completed all of the user stories they thought they could in this sprint. The team has completed a significant portion of the user stories, but the software is not really ready to be demonstrated without all of the stories finished. What should Chris do next?
Perform rolling wave planning.
Correct answer
Have the team lead the sprint review.
Host a retrospective to discuss the issue.
Pause the sprint until the team comes completes the user stories.
Overall explanation
At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates what they have completed. Incomplete work items are not demonstrated, only items that have met the definition of done. It will not be a pleasant meeting, but the team should show what they have done in the sprint. Rolling wave planning is not the best choice for the scenario. This answer does not address the issue of demonstrating what the team has completed in the sprint. A retrospective comes after the sprint review, and it should be led by the scrum master to discuss ways to improve the project. The sprint should not be paused. Incomplete user stories are returned to the product owner for prioritization for the next sprint.

Sherry works for a company that designs and delivers custom workflow solutions for its customers. Sherry is a scrum master for the XYZ project, one of many active projects in this business. Sherry’s project has just concluded a development sprint and has held the sprint review with the product owner and other stakeholders. Sherry schedules and holds a sprint retrospective that identifies changes to several areas of wasted time that need to be removed. These inefficiencies will increase her team’s efficiency. This is an example of which of the following choices?
Business value assessment
Task decomposition
Correct answer
Lean principles
Rolling wave planning
Overall explanation
Lean principles are the correct choice because the sprint retrospective has identified unnecessary activities (waste) in Sherry’s project. Lean looks to remove waste to improve the project or organization. Business value assessment is incorrect because the development process changes are about Sherry’s internal business processes, not about her project’s scope (which is her customer’s business processes). Task decomposition is incorrect because the changes in the development process are about Sherry’s internal business processes, not her project’s scope (which is her customer’s business processes). Rolling wave planning is incorrect because this situation is not at the level of project planning.

Sherry is a project manager for a project which has several non-collocated teams. Her teams are in three different countries with widely separated time zones, and there is no point in time where the business hours for all her teams overlap. However, Sherry’s business day does have a small overlap with her teams on most days. Sherry decides to publish a blog on a schedule so that each team has access to updated project statuses in near real-time on most days. Sherry feels this will make her team feel more connected to the project. What type of communication is Sherry using?
Rolling wave communication
Correct answer
Pull communications
Iterative communications
Push communications
Overall explanation
Pull communication is the correct answer because readers need to take steps to access a blog. Rolling wave communication is incorrect because it is not specified as a communication type. Iterative communications are incorrect because these are not specified as communication types. Push communications are incorrect because Sherry is not sending the communication to specific individuals or groups.

Chris is a project manager for the Alpha Project. Eric, the project sponsor, identifies several senior management stakeholders to Chris. Some of these stakeholders have a significant impact on Chris’s project, and they are concerned about the scope, budget, and deadline. While high in the organization chart, some of the stakeholders don’t have much interest in the project. Chris is preparing a presentation to discuss with Eric how to best interact with these stakeholders. Which artifact would be the most useful to include in this presentation?
Interest/impact matrix
Tornado diagram
Correct answer
Power/interest grid
Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix
Overall explanation
The power/interest grid is correct because Chris is seeking to understand how much power each stakeholder has and how much interest they have in the project to plan how to manage their engagement. The interest/impact matrix is incorrect because it is not a valid project management term – note the word matrix as opposed to grid. It is important on your exam to always choose the most correct answer. The tornado diagram is incorrect because it is not a stakeholder management tool. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is incorrect because there is no information about how engaged each stakeholder is.

Correct answer
Key-value indicators
The effort put into the development
The number of story points completed
Cost savings
Overall explanation
Key-value indicators are the performance metrics you placed based on the context of value in your production environment. It is critical to focus the team on meeting these metrics rather than sprint goals or the number of story points completed. The other options are not values the product owner should steer the team to complete. Agile projects aim to create business value.

Richard is the scrum master for Project WDS, nine iterations into deployment, and has a velocity of 25 story points. Recently Richard discovered that a stakeholder was circumventing established processes and escalating complaints to Richard's manager instead of bringing them up at the sprint reviews. How should Richard handle this scenario?
Confront the stakeholder directly.
E-mail all the stakeholders, reminding them to report issues at sprint reviews.
Hold a special meeting to surface complaints.
Correct answer
Align with his manager on the best approach.
Overall explanation
Given that the stakeholder approached his manager, Richard should align with his manager on the complaint's nature and the best path forward. This will help show a united front and help ensure the stakeholder is appropriately managed. Confronting the stakeholder directly is not ideal as they may have had valid reasons for going around Richard. E-mailing all the stakeholders is an indirect answer that does not directly address the one stakeholder who went around Richard. A special meeting to surface complaints is not ideal as it will not align Richard and his manager.

Rex, a key stakeholder, has stopped by the project commons area and asks Marty, one of the developers, to see the updates on one of the project's features. What should Quincy do next?
Allow Marty to show the stakeholder the work.
Direct the stakeholder to the sprint retrospective.
Correct answer
Ask the stakeholder to wait until the sprint review.
Ask the stakeholder to leave and not come back.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to ask the stakeholder to wait to see the work until the sprint review. Quincy needs to protect the team from interruptions, and the stakeholder needs to review the work when it is ready to be demonstrated at the sprint review. Allowing Marty to show the stakeholder the work is not the best choice as this can disrupt the development team. Stakeholders get to review the work in the sprint review meeting, not during the sprint. The sprint retrospective allows the team to find better ways to improve the project, not review the work. Asking the stakeholder to leave and not come back is certainly tempting, but it is better to coach the stakeholder on the best practices of agile.

Matthew has written code to validate input to ensure that it is appropriate for street addresses. It is the quickest and most comprehensive code written for this purpose to date. In an agile project, we can expect that
Correct answer
All code written for this purpose should be refactored to use Matthew’s approach.
It is inefficient to go back and make corrections to past code, so only future functionality like this should use Matthew’s approach.
The team should create a task on all future address verification work to look at Matthew’s approach.
This should be placed into a user story and put in the backlog.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to refactor using Matthew’s approach. Agile expects that refactoring is estimated and included in the completion of each item. It is not inefficient to go back and make corrections to past code, but it becomes more so the more technical debt builds. There is no requirement to create a future task. Refactoring is considered part of every item and is not a separate user story.

She should limit the team size to 12 resources or less.
She should make sure that they are not assigned more story points than their capacity.
She should ensure that established processes for communication points are followed well.

The most critical focus is creating a shared vision to allow the team to produce faster decisions and trust each other. These incorrect answer choices are not the initial focus to ensure improvement in the two areas listed. There is no mention of having excess team members or her team getting excessive assignments, and there is also nothing mentioned about not having established processes.

You are the project manager for your organization. The ART Project, which you have been working on for the last two months, has a very strict cost constraint, high requirements for quality, and a completion date that falls within the next eight months. If the project exceeds its budget by more than one percent, management will deem the project a failure. Changes to your project have caused the project costs to increase slightly, thereby expanding the project schedule by two weeks. Of the following, which control mechanism is the most important in this project?
Time control
Correct answer
Cost control
Quality control
Scope control
Overall explanation
The predominant constraint on this project is cost, so cost control is the best answer. Though time is important, the cost is the defined constraint. Quality is always important, but the quality is affected by the project’s cost constraint. Scope control is important to a project, but cost control is of higher importance based on the question's information. Though changes to the scope can affect the cost, unacceptable work within the scope can also affect cost.

A new project is forming to create a new warehouse. The warehouse plans call for completion within one year if the expected resources are available. Management requires an in-house development team on this project. However, the project manager and the project sponsor feel the available resources are committed to too many other projects and will not be available to work on the new project. Because of all this, additional time will be needed in developing which of the following choices?
A team development plan
Correct answer
A resource-limited schedule
A procurement management plan
A responsibility assignment matrix
Overall explanation
The project manager should develop a resource-limited schedule because the project team is assigned too many different projects and is not readily available for the project work. A team development plan is a subsidiary plan to train the project team on new or missing skills. Procurement is not an option in this instance. The responsibility assignment matrix is not needed at this time in the project.

Resource planning is an essential component of every project. You will need to know when resources are needed, when they will be released from the project, and what the schedule of each resource is. One tool, a resource histogram, can help with project planning. What is the purpose of a resource histogram?
Correct answer
It enables the project manager to identify when resources will be utilized in project activities.
It enables the project manager to determine how many resources are used in each time period on the project.
It enables the project manager to determine the cost of the resources.
It enables the project manager to identify slipping resources.
Overall explanation
Resource histograms are charts that illustrate when resources are used in a project.

John is the project manager for a software development company. One of his team members, Chris, is not accomplishing the tasks on a project because he has little coding experience. However, there is no one else who meets the skillsets required to succeed in the role. What is the most appropriate solution for John to take?
Provide project completion incentives for Chris to complete the work faster.
Correct answer
Arrange sufficient training for Chris.
Remove Chris from the position and hire a more knowledgeable employee.
Allocate some of the project schedule reserves.
Overall explanation
As the project manager, John should provide or obtain project-specific training for team members. Removing Chris is not the best choice as Chris has been assigned to the team, and there is not enough information to know if Chris was put on the project to learn. In addition, there are no other developers available to help with the coding. Allocating some of the project schedule reserves does not solve the problem of Chris requiring the training to complete the project work. Incentives are not going to be useful as Chris does not know how to do the current work and needs training.

Akshat has taken over a landscaping project in the local community. While attempting to get up to date on the progress made so far, Akshat discovers several significant issues on why the previous project manager was fired from his position. A recurring theme was that the project manager received a lot of negative feedback from residents for trying to build over historic lands. For this reason, the project manager made several critical decisions without consulting with the regional council. What conflict management technique did the previous project manager most likely used?
Smooth or accommodate
Correct answer
Withdraw or avoid
Force or direct
Compromise or reconcile
Overall explanation
In this scenario, the construction manager used the withdraw/avoid conflict resolution technique. The project manager was likely pressured by the community residents due to the controversy surrounding the project and avoided communicating with them while making critical project decisions and avoiding difficult conversations. Force or direct happens when the project manager makes decisions with little input or consideration for others' viewpoints. Compromise means that both parties give up something they want and is considered a lose-lose. Smoothing or accommodating smooths over the issues and downplays the differences without really achieving a solution for both parties.

Ronald is assessing his agile project at Haly’s Circus using a double-S curve earned value tool. The line representing the scope built is much lower than the lines representing actual spending and projected progress. What does this tell him?
Correct answer
The team is behind in scope compared to projections.
The team is fine, as projected progress and actual spending are aligned.
The actual spending is much higher than projected spending.
The team is behind in scope, and the costs are higher than expected.
Overall explanation
A line showing scope built at a very low level compared to projected progress indicates that the story points completed are not where they were forecast to be. The chart does not indicate anything related to spending, as we do not know the projected spending amount. The line representing the scope creation shows the scope is less than what was planned, but the costs are not lower than anticipated. It does indicate that there is an issue with scope, so the team is not fine.

Jan took over a project that is 80% completed. The project is scheduled to be completed in two months. It is ahead of schedule and under budget. The project will provide value to the company in general. It is a high-profile project, and the project team is composed of team members that temporarily became part of the team for the project's sake. When the project ends, the team members will go back to their respective teams and resume their everyday work. Most team members are happy with the assignment and the break in their day-to-day work. However, two of the team members have a severe conflict. Three months before Jan took over, these two team members had a nasty argument and then settled into a quiet silence. The two team members with the issues are doing their work but will not speak to one another. When the project ends in two months, they will go back to their respective teams. How should Jan handle this conflict?
Mediation
Forcefulness
Correct answer
Avoidance
Collaborate
Overall explanation
This is a rare situation where avoidance may be best. If Jan ignores the conflict, then she is not bringing the conflict to the surface at a critical time for the project. In two months, the project will complete, and the team will disband. If the project had more time, it would be wise for Jan to dig deeper into the conflict. For now, she should leave the issue alone but keep a close eye on it. Mediation sounds like a good solution, but the team members who hate one another have settled into a place where they are co-existing already. Forcing the two employees to do something is likely to spark more conflict. Collaboration is already happening on the team, so this is not the best choice for the scenario.

Jeremy is the project manager for Project Planet, which is in its third week of implementation, is $5,000 over a $100,000 budget, and is on schedule. A stakeholder has asked Jeremy to move a significant project milestone two weeks later in the project. What should Jeremy do next?
Agree and move the milestone since it is later in the project.
Reject the request since it is not in the project plan.
Hire a consultant to advise Jeremy on the implications of the move.
Correct answer
Gather data about the milestone and the impact of moving it.
Overall explanation
Before deciding on the move, Jeremy should review the milestone and determine what impact moving the milestone would have on the project. Agreeing to the proposal is not ideal, as Jeremy does not know that will impact the project. Bringing in a consultant before analyzing the change will only incur additional costs. It is best to gather data and see what effect delaying the milestone will have on the remainder of the project. Rejecting the proposal is not ideal, as Jeremy does not know how the proposal will impact the project.

Alison is the project manager of an agile project and she's meeting with her team to coach them on the best agile approaches. The team is concerned that stakeholders will constantly be adding things to the project scope and they'll never finish the project. Why is this not a valid concern in an agile project?

Agile projects welcome change and it's okay if the project continues indefinitely.

Changes are limited to ten percent of the project budget.

Correct answer
The cost and time are fixed in an agile project.

Changes are limited to ten percent of the project costs.

Overall explanation
Agile projects utilize an inverted triple constraints triangle, where the project scope is flexible, but the time and costs are fixed. There is only so much time and money to complete the project. The most important elements of the project are always done first, and the lesser-valued items are done last. Additions to the scope will be prioritized, so some items may fall out of the project due to the costs and time available, but the most important items are done first for the customer.

Zachary is the project manager for Project Ice. The project is in its fifth week of the planned twelve-week implementation, one week behind schedule, and has a CPI of 1.01. Recently a new team member joined the team. In addition to reviewing the project with them, what else should Zachary do?
Correct answer
Ensure the new team member knows what the team's responsibilities are.
Ask the product owner to help the new team member.
Do nothing. The project team will handle the rest.
Invite the new member to the steering committee meetings.
Overall explanation
Zachary should ensure the new team member knows the rest of the project team and what everyone is responsible for in the project. This will help integrate the new team member and get them up to speed. Generally, the team does not attend steering committee meetings. Doing nothing risks the new team member not fully integrating with the team, which would harm productivity. There is no product owner in a predictive project.

Michele is the project manager of a large project, and she has fifty stakeholders. Just a few days ago, Michele was assigned three new graduate employees on her team to work on this project. The three new team members will help with project communication, providing status reports, and maintaining project information from other project team members. As a means of getting them acclimated with the current project, Michele wants to get them up to date quickly. What should Michele do first?
Update the stakeholder engagement plan.
Hold a team-building exercise with the new members.
Set the graduate employees aside and discuss with them their expectations.
Correct answer
Review the stakeholder register with the new graduate employees.
Overall explanation
The stakeholder register is a project document that contains all current information about the stakeholders. The stakeholder register includes the stakeholder identification information, assessment information, and stakeholder classification. The project team uses it to maintain information about the stakeholder's expectations and interests with the project. By reviewing the stakeholder register with the new team members, the project manager can provide them with information about each project stakeholder, politics surrounding the project, and other relevant details about the project and the stakeholders that may help the new team members to get up to speed with the overall dynamics of the project and engage effectively with the project stakeholders. There is no change to the stakeholder engagement plan at this point; Michele is onboarding new staff members. Team building exercises are a great way to achieve cohesiveness and gel the team together; however, they will not quickly get a person up to date on project matters. Discussing expectations with a staff member is a necessary step to make sure they are happy; however, it will not bring a person up to speed.

Yang is the financial manager at a major banking corporation. He has been placed in charge of opening new branches in three different countries. This project will require Yang to coordinate with local project teams, consider compliance requirements for each country, and work closely with the bank's regulatory officers. Alice, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), is also interested in seeing this project through as excellent potential to make the corporation several millions of dollars in profits. What stakeholder management strategy should Yang utilize for Alice?
Keep Alice satisfied.
Correct answer
Manage Alice closely.
Keep Alice informed.
Monitor Alice's actions.
Overall explanation
In a typical power/interest grid, Alice falls under the category of a high-power/high-interest stakeholder. For this reason, Yang should manage Alice closely as she is the highest-ranking employee within the corporation. She is also interested in the profits that can be made from the project. Keeping Alice informed is not the best choice as she has high power as the CEO and has expressed high interest in the project. If Alice had low power and low interest, then keeping her informed would be appropriate. Keeping Alice satisfied is useful when a person has high power in the organization, but low interest in the project. Monitoring Alice's actions would be applicable if Alice had low power and low interest. Of course, Alice has high power and high interest in this large project.

Today is Juan's first day back. In the last hour, he has had stakeholders and project team members come to his office stating that they do not understand why there is an inconsistency in a report. Each one is blaming the other for the improper documentation. Juan must determine what the inconsistency is and if the concern was raised while he was gone. Where could Juan look to find possible documentation of any conflicts?
Change request forms
Correct answer
Issue log
Activity list
Risk register
Overall explanation
Documentation on various events that could be considered as gaps, inconsistencies, conflicts, or problems is called an issue log. This is a project document that is used to record and track data that covers these issues. If an issue was noted in the issue log, Juan could find out why there is an inconsistency within the report and where the breakdown happened. Once found, he can use conflict management to work with the stakeholders and team members to address the concerns and resolve the issue. Change request forms are not going to document issues but would instead document change requests for the project. The activity list does not address issues but lists all the activities needed to complete the items in the project's work breakdown structure. The risk register is used to document the identified risk, risk responses, and outcomes of the risk event.

The conversation was getting heated, and David interjected, requesting that the two team members remain calm in the disagreement and table the issue for a day. What should David do next?
Correct answer
Speak with both team members about the misunderstanding.
Do nothing. The team members will figure it out.
Report the conflict to the team members’ functional manager.
Escalate the issue to the change control board.
Overall explanation
David should work with the team members to understand what is going on and determine a path forward. David should ensure that the team members work through the conflict, and he should coach the team member's on what's best for the project's business value. The team member's manager is unlikely to assist and likely does not need to be involved. It is David's responsibility to work with the team members and coach them to a good resolution.

What should be the first step for Conor to take as the relieving project manager?
Consult with the general manager on what needs to be done next.
Correct answer
Determine a management strategy.
Review the schedule management plan.
Review the cost management plan.
Overall explanation
Before any other actions, Conor needs to determine a more effective management strategy. A proper approach encourages performance and buy-in to achieve the project objectives, rather than Conor's predecessor's attempts to micromanage the team. Reviewing the schedule management plan will need to be completed, but first, an effective management strategy needs to be created, communicated, and implemented.

You are the project manager of a project to manufacture a new product. The project is almost complete. The initial product is being tested, and the quality engineers discover a part is 7 millimeters off target. Because of the error, the product was rejected. What is the likely outcome of this scenario?
Correct answer
The project team must rework the part to correct the problem.
The prototype is discarded, and the design document is re-created.
The project has been deemed a failure and is canceled.
A change request must be immediately created to change the product’s design.
Overall explanation
The project is not over. Rework must be done to align the project with the product requirements. A change request is not the best answer for this question. Rework is required instead to correct the problem. A change request signifies an addition or subtraction from the project scope. This is not a viable option.

Correct answer
The project cycles each have a fixed time and fixed cost, but the scope of the work completed within each cycle may vary.
Overall explanation
The agile triangle of constraints is a model that represents fixed cost and time, but variable scope. A fixed scope represents the traditional model of the triangle of constraints.

An increase in the duration of the project when the amount of work in progress is limited.
Overall explanation
Little’s Law states that the length of time it takes to complete work increases with the amount of work in progress, so a decrease in the length of time it takes to complete work corresponds to a decrease in the amount of work in progress. All other choices do not accurately represent Little’s Law.

Javiera works as a project manager but spends more time coordinating stakeholder approval, sign-off for requirements gathering and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). This focus on stakeholder engagement leads to a significant deficit in time spent monitoring risk, quality, and cost. The coordination provided by Javiera is so significant that her company is considering hiring another project manager to take over the work she does not have time to do. This is an outcome Javiera would prefer to avoid. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by:
Using open and effective communication
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Correct answer
Encouraging collaborative decision-making
Creating team-building opportunities
Overall explanation
Mentors can often offload work that they do not need to oversee by mentoring stakeholders on collaborative decision-making. While it can help closely oversee stakeholder processes, it is almost always ideal to set up a process that encourages stakeholders to collaborate without a facilitator before requesting a project manager. Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance, but this is more crucial at the early stages of team development. Managing conflicts is an important part of mentorship and coaching, but there is not a conflict to resolve in this scenario. Open and effective communication is paramount in project management, but communication is happening in this scenario. The best choice is to create collaboration opportunities for the team and the stakeholders.

You are the project manager for your organization and you are leading a software development program. Your project team has eleven people working on the project objectives. Over the past six months, your team has been virtual due to the travel restrictions and the pandemic. Several team members have expressed interest in an upcoming conference in Las Vegas and travel restrictions have been significantly reduced. How do you handle their interest?
Tell them that there will be another event next year and that they need to be focused on this project.
Correct answer
Verify with management the availability of funds that have been allocated for training so that you can sign them up for the event.
Encourage them to find smaller workshops that are not costly or time-consuming.
Sign up for the event yourself and then come back and have a PowerPoint presentation about the event.
Overall explanation
Having team members that want to grow their knowledge and skills is as important as project completion. Ensuring that time is spent in training can motivate team members to keep working hard and for the company. Placing value on their interest can also develop more in-depth communication and trust within your team. Minimizing the team's interest in the training event and putting it off until next year can be demoralizing. The best choice is to review the training with management and see if the budget would allow the team to attend the event. The best choice is to communicate with management about the training budget and approval for the team to learn new approaches for the organizational work. No. Just no. Your team will not appreciate you trekking to Vegas and later showing them a PowerPoint about the conference. Not a good idea at all.

Deni thought about this for a moment and realized this was correct. Jose does, however, type quickly and does a good job taking the minutes. What should Deni do next?
Tell Jose that one of his assignments in this project is to take the meeting minutes.
Request that Jose develops a training program on how to take minutes and train the other team members to take minutes.
Explain to Jose that taking the minutes in a meeting is an essential task and should be done by someone competent.
Correct answer
Rotate the task of taking minutes among the team members.
Overall explanation
Taking meeting minutes can be painful, even if you type quickly and do a good job. It is not fair to seemingly punish Jose for being a good note-taker. It is fair that everyone takes turns to keep the minutes and not always pick Jose to do this job. Some organizations hire a scribe to keep minutes as it is such a tedious assignment. Asking Jose to develop a training program and train the other team members to take minutes is not the best choice as Jose may not have the competency or time to develop a training program for others. Telling Jose that one of his assignments in this project is to take the meeting minutes is not the best choice as the question tells us he is always picked in the meeting to keep the minutes.

Yolanda is the scrum master for Project F that is midway through its ninth iteration. A new developer asks the team why Yolanda spends so much time ensuring the team has everything it needs to work during a retrospective. What is Yolanda's most likely response?
She does not trust the team, so she keeps a close eye on it.
Correct answer
Setting the team up for success is part of servant leadership.
Scrum masters do not have anything better to do.
Her bonus is tied to the success of Project F.
Overall explanation
Servant leadership involves "carrying food and water for the team", such leaders support the team members to maximize their impact. By ensuring the team has everything they need, Yolanda is clearing obstacles and enhancing their work. Yolanda's bonus may or may not be tied to the success of the project, but the best answer is that servant leaders provide for the project team. Keeping a close eye on the team members is not an agile principle, as the team is to be self-led and self-organizing.

Virginia is a project manager for her organization. She has a new team, and all the team members require the same training to complete the project planning and execution. When scheduling time for the training, what is Virginia's best option?

Purchase the online training and have the team members complete the training at their own pace.
Have one team member attend the training and then have that team member train the rest of the team.
To keep the project moving, schedule the team members for the training on different days.
Overall explanation
Since the training is required to work on the project, the team members should not work on the project until the training is completed. Conducting work without the proper training could result in unnecessary risk and rework. The training needs to be completed before the project work begins. This choice does not ensure that the training will precede the project work. The option makes the solution more complex and does not ensure that the training will precede the project work.

A construction project is behind schedule because of a safety mishap on the worksite. Due to safety requirements not being followed, an employee was hurt. This accident has caused inspections and regulatory delays for the project. After further investigation, the construction manager discovered that one of the front-line supervisors had been signing off on safety checklists without taking the proper precautions. As a result, the construction manager removes the supervisor from the team. This is an example of what type of conflict resolution technique?
Correct answer
Force or direct
Collaborate, or problem-solve
Compromise or reconcile
Smooth or accommodate
Overall explanation
In this scenario, the construction manager used the force/direct conflict resolution technique. As the source of conflict was a situation where a safety mishap occurred, the construction manager used his position of power to resolve the emergency. Collaborate, or problem-solve requires the people in conflict to work together for a resolution in the project. Compromise or reconcile conflict resolution requires both parties to give up something as part of the agreed-upon solution. Smooth or accommodate downplays the problems and smooths over the issue.

Project team members' emails are broad and undefined, long and too informal. Riley feels that there has been a disregard of the ground rules for stakeholder engagement and team communications. What should Riley do next to improve project communications with the team?
Correct answer
Coach the team members to be better communicators and show the reasons why better communications are needed.
Send a team email addressing those who have become lax in their communications.
Call the stakeholders and take responsibility for the poor communications of your team.
Call a meeting with stakeholders and team members addressing these issues and ways to correct them.

As part of servant leadership, you coach the team members as needed. Showing the team the reasons why helps people better understand the coaching and the reason for the conversation. Sending an email is not as effective as coaching and explaining the issue with the team members. Calling the stakeholders and taking the blame is not the best choice.

Paulina should include equipment for team members who are not co-located. This will help ensure they can effectively engage with other team members. Weekly flights to bring in the remote team members is not a likely solution due to the costs involved with ongoing travel. Remote team members may also not be open to this solution.

Thomas is the project manager for installing a fiber-optic network in the company's headquarters. He is holding a brainstorming session with key stakeholders to identify inherent risks in the project. After all of the risks have been identified, Thomas immediately assigns risk owners for the project. He also delegates the task of preparing risk response plans to each risk owner. Has Thomas properly conducted risk management planning?
Yes, Thomas is correct in assigning the risk owners to create a risk response plan after identifying the risks.
No, Thomas is overall responsible for the fiber optic installation outcome and should be the one who develops all the risk responses.
Correct answer
No, Thomas should assess each risk's probability of occurrence and its impact on the project.
Yes, risk response plans should be developed as soon as possible to submit the risk management plan for approval.
Overall explanation
Thomas should ensure each risk is assessed for the probability of occurrence and its impact on the project. After identifying the risks, the next step in the risk management framework is to evaluate the risks through qualitative and quantitative risk analysis. Although Thomas is overall responsible for the project outcomes, he should make an informed decision before assigning risk owners by analyzing the risks. This process includes qualitative and quantitative analysis of the identified risks, determining who is most suited to own those risks.

You lead a self-organizing team of developers and testers who are rapidly releasing incremental features on a mobile banking application that the team has built from the ground up. During which scrum ceremony will you involve the operations team, whose responsibility will be to support the applications and the new features after product increment has gone into production mode?
Sprint planning
Correct answer
Sprint review
Backlog grooming
Daily standup
Overall explanation
A sprint review meeting is held to showcase the completed work to the stakeholders. The sprint review meeting is an appropriate time to include the operations groups supporting the product. Sprint planning is a ceremony where the team determines how much work can be completed in the sprint. Backlog grooming is completed by the product owner to prioritize the product backlog. The daily standup is a type of status meeting for the project team members.

Congratulations! You have just been hired as a contract project manager for a large software development project. Your project team will be a remote team spread across five time zones. Today, you are managing your first virtual team meeting. What will be the most helpful towards managing a diverse, virtual team that works well together?
Correct answer
Developing team ground rules with the project team.
Mandating that the team attend every status check-in meeting.
Hosting a team-building event at the start of his project.
Have the entire team work overlapping hours.
Overall explanation
Of these options, the most helpful tool for managing a virtual team is developing ground rules. Ground rules, especially those developed by the team itself, serve to prevent conflicts in the team. Hosting a team-building event at the start of a project is a great idea. However, this will not sustain team cohesion over the life of a long project. Mandating the team's status check-in attendance may seem helpful, but this will not ensure that the team will work well together. Having the entire team work overlapping hours likely is not realistic as the team is spread across five time zones. This option, even if feasible, does not necessarily contribute to managing the team as much as establish fair and reasonable ground rules for the project.

One of the most distinguishing features of the FDD approach to building software is:
Having a single business analyst, programmer, and development team own each section of code.
Having a single set of peers own each section of code.
Having a feature team own each section of code.
Correct answer
Having a single owner for each section of code.

Your team is negotiating with another team to determine how the software components both teams are designing will eventually interface with each other. The conversations focus on three subjects: identifying the core competencies of the different team members, enumerating the skills that they are missing, and confirming a viable path forward for both teams. In addition to discussing features that must be present, the teams share their thoughts on which features would be nice to have and which issues they expect to encounter along the way. Which stage of the negotiating process does this represent?
Terms negotiation
Closure
Correct answer
Exploration
Acceptance
Overall explanation
Exploration occurs when the negotiating parties explore their strengths and weaknesses, compare goals, and otherwise articulate desired outcomes. Terms negotiation entails each party making offers and exploring all possible scenarios before finding a middle path. Closure is when both parties restate and confirm any trade-offs they are willing to make or issues that require further negotiation. Acceptance occurs when both parties accept the outcome or the fact that there will not be an outcome.

Rebecca is the project manager for Project Reading, which recently conducted a gap analysis of its plan. Several stakeholders have pressed Rebecca to take immediate action on the analysis. What should Rebecca do next?
Ask the project team for their opinion.
Agree and act immediately.
Correct answer
Thoroughly review the analysis and propose a series of changes.
Escalate the decision to the steering committee.
Overall explanation
Before taking any action, Rebecca should understand the analysis. Once she understands the analysis, she can submit change requests to close the gaps. Acting immediately is not ideal as Rebecca may not fully understand the analysis, and any changes will have to go through the change management process. Escalating the situation to the steering committee is not likely to be able to assist in this situation. Asking the project team for their opinion is not likely to assist in this scenario and is not the best answer to this question.

Doris has noticed that they have a trend of insufficiently described user stories on their team as of late. What should Doris do about this issue?
Correct answer
Focus more on team collaboration and potentially on more training for those writing the user stories if they would like it.
Ensure that performance feedback is given to those writing requirements.
Insist on training on user stories to the team writing them.
Ensure that the entire team receives training on their software tracking tool to ensure user stories are entered correctly.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to focus on collaboration and facilitate training if the team feels it is needed. Doris should not decide about training alone, and the team would be responsible for feedback to others as well, not Doris. Agile solutions tend to focus on collaboration rather than unilateral decision-making.

You are a project management consultant for a large, international manufacturer. They are considering shifting to remote teams throughout the globe so people can work from home, but they have some concerns about the configuration and management of these remote teams. What is a potential benefit of a virtual team?
Virtual teams broaden market reach.
Virtual teams are less expensive than collocated teams.
Virtual teams give most organizations a tax break.
Correct answer
Virtual teams make expertise from other locations available.
Overall explanation
The primary benefit of a virtual team is making the expertise more widely available. Rather than having resources collocated in one physical environment, virtual teams can utilize resources regardless of their physical location. Through virtual teams, organizations can access the best expertise in the world. Virtual teams are not inherently more or less expensive than collocated teams. Virtual teams broadening market reach is not an attribute of virtual teams. Virtual teams do not give most organizations a tax break. The PMP exam will not question you at any depth about tax scenarios as each country and region have different tax laws.

Brian has encountered an issue in his project. He chooses to write a new function that takes a few hours to create. If he had first researched the built-in functions of the coding language he is using, he would have learned that there is already an existing function created to fulfill this need. The best choice to describe Brian’s behavior is:
Self-reliance
A poor reward system
Correct answer
A failure mode
A success mode
Overall explanation
Brian’s behavior is an example of preferring to invent rather than research, which is a failure mode. A success mode is focused on an area that helps, not hinders, and does not best describe his behavior. Self-reliance is an irrelevant term. A poor reward system is an irrelevant term.

You have requested that your team complete an individual brainstorming session before the next meeting to generate ideas for what features these playgrounds should incorporate. Which data representation technique would be most appropriate to use for the meeting?
Pareto diagram
Affinity diagrams
Fishbone diagrams
Correct answer
Mind mapping
Overall explanation
Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and generating new ideas. A Pareto diagram is a bar chart used to identify the fewest sources that solve the largest amount of problems. Affinity diagrams are a group of creative techniques that classify a large number of items into groups.

Wade excelled as a technician for ten years before being promoted to project manager. Since then, his department has experienced a fifty percent turnover annually. While his new employees are almost always collaborative, self-motivated, and well acquainted with Wade's department's goals, they frequently must work overtime to fix mistakes in their work, which is complex and often requires individual attention. Although Wade often anticipates issues in his employee's work, he does not always mention them because he does not want to seem overly critical, even though several employees have actively solicited his feedback. If Wade wants to decrease turnover in his department, what is the appropriate leadership style he should adopt?
Correct answer
Coaching
Directive
Participative
Visionary
Overall explanation
Coaching allows skilled project managers to impart their knowledge to employees, increasing human capital and encouraging acknowledgment and acceptance of feedback. If employees are open to learning more, a coaching leadership style will help employees grow into their roles. A directive style is not appropriate for complex work that requires critical thinking. A participative leadership style is inappropriate for work that can be done more productively alone than in collaboration with others. A visionary leadership style may not be beneficial if employees already understand a department or organization's goals.

Chris is a project manager for Ringydingy Corporation, which is just beginning a new project. This organization does not use agile, though they are interested in the approach. The organization has strict compliance requirements and is worried agile projects cannot comply. After a recent meeting, a senior stakeholder approached Chris, who asked him to begin project work immediately on a new initiative that has high business value. How should Chris respond?
Agree and begin work using an agile approach.
Correct answer
Let the stakeholder know he first must develop the project's plans.
Refer the stakeholder to senior management.
Ask them to speak with the project team.
Overall explanation
Chris first needs to consolidate all the work required for this project. Once he has completed that, he may begin work. This organization is still using predictive, so Chris and the team will follow the predictive approach and do the upfront planning before executing the plan. Agreeing is not a good option as Chris has not yet developed the project plans. Referring them to senior management is not the best choice as this is a senior stakeholder in the organization. Asking the stakeholder to speak with the project team is not the best answer as the new project likely does not yet have the project team assembled.

This project will create a new structure for the organization's road repair equipment. A vendor reports that they have finalized an elevator lift for the project. In addition to checking their work, what should George do next?
Update organizational process assets.
Correct answer
Ensure appropriate knowledge transfers have occurred.
Refer the vendor to another client.
Release the vendor from their contract.
Overall explanation
George should ensure they have transferred any appropriate knowledge to the project team. This will help ensure the team is able to use the vendor's deliverables properly. For example, there may be maintenance the team should do on the elevator, operational controls, warranty information, and other materials that George should confirm the team is in possession of before the vendor leaves the project. George should not release the vendor until any appropriate knowledge transfers have occurred. Referring the vendor to another client would not be an appropriate next step in this scenario. Updating the organizational process assets would not be the best next step.

An organization is seeking to improve its individual and team performance to achieve its overall goals better. Caroline, the portfolio manager, has asked you to develop some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using SMART criteria. Which of the following factors should be considered to obtain a high-level understanding of how the KPIs should be aligned?
Organizational objectives
Critical Success Factors
How the work packages will be managed
Correct answer
The strategic vision
Overall explanation
The strategic vision is the highest level that feeds down to organization strategy, objectives, critical success factors, KPIs, and final individual action. Work packages are typically associated at the lowest levels of a work breakdown structure. KPIs must be in alignment with the organization's objectives, but the strategic vision is the first thing project and performance must be aligned to. Critical success factors are components of performance that communicate if a project has been successful or not. KPIs are often aligned, after the strategic vision, with the critical success factors.

Management has come to you, a senior project manager, to help Ralph review the ground rules he and the team have created for a new project. As you and Ralph review suggestions for ground rules with his project team, which one of the following suggested rules is inappropriate as a team ground rule?
The team will meet on Tuesdays to distribute work items across team members.
The team will appoint a team member to direct contractors.
Correct answer
The team will award a $500 bonus every month to the team member who contributes the most.
The team will share bi-weekly status updates with the project manager.
Overall explanation
It is not appropriate for the team to financially reward another team member. Not only is it unlikely that the project team has the authority to provide a financial reward, but it is also likely that this would pose a conflict of interest. In addition, when only one person can win the reward, it is considered a zero-sum reward and may cause contempt among the team members. The team will meet on Tuesdays to distribute work items across team members is a reasonable ground rule, so this choice is incorrect. The team will share bi-weekly status updates with the project manager is a reasonable ground rule, so this choice is incorrect. The team will appoint a team member to direct contractors is a reasonable ground rule, so this choice is incorrect.

Susan has created an agile approach to welcome and incorporate expected changes into her team’s project. Her best approach is:
Susan holds daily standup change request meetings to incorporate changes quickly.
Susan adds all changes to the sprint backlog.
Correct answer
As changes are discovered, Susan notes the new work needed and places the notes into a backlog where the full team can see them in the future.
Susan makes her company aware of the new items and works out a guarantee with the sponsor to respond in 24 hours to all new change control requests.
Overall explanation
The appropriate approach to handling changes is to make the changes highly visible, discuss them as a team, and place the change request into the backlog for future use. An appropriate change management approach involves more than meeting with the client. New items do not go into the sprint backlog; they go into the product backlog instead. This approach would be enforcing a very formal change control process, which is not the best approach.

Pull the junior member aside and discipline them.
Correct answer
Work with the senior member to make time for instructing the junior team member.
Remove the junior member from the team.
Tell the senior member to discipline the junior member.
Overall explanation
The time taken by the senior member of the team to fix the mistakes could be better spent teaching the junior member. This prevents future errors, frees the senior member's time, and upskills the junior team member. Team discipline, when needed, should come from the project manager. Disciplining the junior member will not help them stop making mistakes. Removing the junior member from the team deprives him of a learning opportunity.

Based on the team's previous performance evaluation, the CEO wants to keep the team together to work on an upcoming, similar project but with Jim, a new project manager. What would be the best way for Joe to hand the team off to Jim?
Correct answer
Let Jim build a new team charter, assumption log, and risk register.
Do nothing and let Jim figure it out for himself.
Share all the training and performance review information from the last two years.
Share the current team charter, assumption log, and risk register.
Overall explanation
Since Jim is the new project manager and the team will be working on a new project together, it is the project manager's responsibility to acquire the new team charter, assumption log, and risk register. While the project may be similar to past projects, assuming that any documentation can be recycled is not good. Most project documentation is archived for reference but generally cannot be immediately adapted to new projects. Doing nothing and letting Jim figure it out for himself is not a professional or valid answer. Sharing all the training and performance review information from the last two years will not help Jim get the new project moving forward. Sharing the current team charter, assumption log, and risk register is an acceptable second-choice answer. Still, the best answer is that each project is different, so the charter, assumption log, and risk register will need to be created and be unique to each project.

She may need to require another level of testing on her projects.
Government projects typically require additional community feedback.
Correct answer
Her team may desire more rigorous processes in some cases due to the impact of the software on others.
Overall explanation
The best choice is that her team may want to have more rigorous processes in some cases, as a mistake in their software could have a major community impact. There is nothing that points to extra testing specifically but more to extra rigor across many aspects of the project. The government project information is irrelevant. There is nothing to indicate that she would need a larger team than another agile project.

A project manager successfully delivers on a project but discovers that their perceived competence has a downside: they have been invited to every meeting the stakeholders attend, effectively reducing their time for managing a new project to zero. After attending several rounds of meetings, the project manager observes that they have little to contribute and tend to meet with the same people, albeit in the company of different stakeholders. When the project manager does contribute, it is typically to remind the stakeholders of the policies, job aids, and SOPs they themselves approved. Without the project manager's leadership, the new project comes to a standstill. This is an opportunity to provide mentoring by:
Creating team-building opportunities
Managing conflicts in a constructive manner
Correct answer
Using open and effective communication
Encouraging collaborative problem-solving
Overall explanation
Mentorship for open and effective communication is always an ongoing process since communication tends toward whatever is expedient rather than efficient. Creating a wiki with commonly asked questions is one way a project manager can save time spent communicating the same ideas repeatedly or otherwise serving as a kind of professional safety blanket. Mentorship to encourage team building is critical for cultivating high team performance, but this is more crucial at the early stages of team development. There is not a conflict in this scenario, so this is not the best choice for the question. The question does not present a collaboration issue, so this is not the best choice.

She relates that she felt left out of decisions and direction in the project before she became a project manager. One of her first goals is to communicate the organizational principles of her project to her team and stakeholders. Of the following, which one would not be effective for Darlene to choose for this goal?
Poster of project goals, objectives, and expected benefit and value
Stakeholder roles and responsibility matrix, RACI chart

A project status report is generally used to communicate project details rather than overarching principles. This is a tricky question as it hints that Darlene wants to keep everyone informed, but the question is about Darlene reaching her first goal of communicating the organizational principles of her project. A project organizational chart can be helpful to show the segments of the stakeholders and the project team. Stakeholder roles and responsibility matrix and RACI charts focus on who's doing what task and their responsibility.

After joining the project team, Deidra has discovered that the project team is already in the project's execution phase. The project methodology the team has taken is unknown. When Deidra asks the project team to document the project requirements, the developer bluntly mentions that the project's extensive documentation is not complete. The developer feels that documentation would be a burden to the project and would slow down project work. What should Deidra do as the new project manager to obtain the project's documentation while establishing a good relationship with the developer and other team members?
Avoid the issue altogether by not addressing the problem any further with the developer and project team.
Try to accommodate the developer and team's concerns by focusing on agreement areas regarding the project's documentation while maintaining harmony among the team members.
Correct answer
Collaborate with the project team regarding documentation of project requirements by problem-solving to determine the level of documentation needed for the project.
Directly inform the developer and the team that documentation of project requirements or a product backlog will be required so that the project manager can track the project.
Overall explanation
Collaborate/problem-solve. Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives; requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to consensus and commitment. This approach can result in a win-win situation. Avoiding the issue altogether does not resolve the scenario and can create more issues in the project. Accommodation is sometimes acceptable for smaller issues that can be smoothed over, but it is usually best to confront the problem and find a collaboration to get the work done. Forcing the resolution is more authoritarian and does not allow the team to work together to find a resolution for the issue.

The next sprint is about to start, and Oscar has been informed the product owner has rearranged the backlog. What should he do next?
Speak to the product owner on why the change has been made.
Complain to his manager about the product owner changing the backlog.
Correct answer
Let the team choose the work for their sprint backlog.
Reset the backlog to how it was before as the change was not approved.
Overall explanation
Backlog changes are common in agile projects, and the product owner oversees prioritizing the requirements in the backlog. In the sprint planning meeting, the team will choose the number of stories they can complete in the sprint. This selection of features will become the tasks in the sprint backlog. Resetting the backlog is not ideal as the product owner ultimately decides on priority. Speaking to the product owner is not necessary as the product owner is responsible for the prioritization of the backlog. Complaining to the manager is not helpful; there is really nothing to complain about because the product owner is doing what he is supposed to do in the project.

Dana leads a team of consultants that come from many different backgrounds. His oldest employee has been with the company for twenty years, and his newest just graduated from high school. Some are playful and witty, while others are quiet and reflective. Most of them grew up in the same country as Dana, but a few were born abroad. Dana's team will be working on a proposal. To kick it off, Dana wants to have a whiteboarding session that will allow people to brainstorm ideas, refine them with the group, and assign them. While this has worked well in the past, Dana is concerned that some team members will not speak up. Which type of diversity could be supported to improve team performance?
Behavioral
Age
Cultural
Correct answer
Cognitive
Overall explanation
Cognitive diversity recognizes that people have different ways of thinking about things and coming to conclusions. Some people do well in a collaborative cognitive capacity, but others perform best when they can work alone. Behavioral diversity describes the work ethics, teamwork, and professionalism of the individual. Cultural diversity describes the culture, beliefs and value system of an individual or team. Age diversity describes the relative age and experience among the project team.

Emelia is the scrum master for Project O, which just completed a sprint review for its stakeholders. What additional task does Emelia need to perform before the next iteration begins?
Correct answer
Perform a retrospective with the team.
Update the team’s velocity.
Document lessons learned.
Release the project team.
Overall explanation
Before beginning the next iteration, the team should conduct a retrospective. This will allow the team to learn from the last sprint and improve their performance. Lessons learned are an output of the retrospective. The project team should not be released until the project is completed. The team’s velocity depends on the number of story points completed.

Ronald’s team has asked that the WIP limit for their project be increased from 12 to 15. Ronald’s initial response to this request should be:
To adhere to whatever the team has decided for themselves.
Correct answer
To investigate the cause of this before tailoring the process.
To calculate the throughput and determine the impact on cycle time.
To communicate the process change to all stakeholders.
Overall explanation
The initial focus should be on why there is a need to increase the WIP limit, which is likely due to the number of open items being worked at one time. If WIP limits need to increase, the team should first understand why, as too many items in WIP often point to a bottleneck. There is no requirement to calculate throughput or cycle time. There is no need to change the communication process.

Tom is the scrum master for a project in its second iteration and finished 25 story points in its first sprint. During a recent sprint review, several stakeholders were confused over who was responsible for completing various project tasks. How can Tom clear up this confusion?
Perform qualitative analysis to determine who is responsible for what.
Correct answer
Refer the stakeholders to the roles and responsibilities of the project.
Have the project team meet with the stakeholders.
Refer the stakeholders to the project’s information radiators.
Overall explanation
Tom should refer the stakeholders to the project’s roles and responsibilities matrix. This document clearly outlines who is responsible for what and will answer their questions. Qualitative analysis is used to understand the quality of risks or other events. Information radiators share status information relating to the project. Having the project team meet with the stakeholders will not help answer questions about who is responsible for what.

Hannah is the project manager for Project Leopard, which is ten weeks into implementation, two weeks behind schedule, and has ten weeks of planned work. Recently Hannah was told that a highly critical task was just completed but has spawned several follow-on tasks. The tasks are needed to install the deliverable that has been created. Once the deliverable installation is complete, then the successor activities can move forward. During the project planning, the team assumed that someone else would be installing the deliverable. What should Hannah do about the additional work?
Escalate the tasks to the steering committee.
Fast track the tasks.
Use the management reserve.
Correct answer
Refer to the change control process.
Overall explanation
Hannah should refer to the project's documented change control process, which will guide her in her next steps. The steering committee provides a high-level oversite of the project and is unlikely able to assist. Fast-tracking may not be the ideal solution given Project L's change control processes. The management reserve is used for unknown risks that impact the project.

Priya is taking notes during a meeting with Bob, a major stakeholder. Bob talks very quickly and at length about his expectations for the project they are planning. Priya tries to write as much down as possible, but Bob quickly switches between subjects, giving only a high-level overview. After the meeting, Priya compiles her notes and reviews them with her project manager. The project manager explains that they already have a high-level understanding of the project but that what they needed from the meeting were deadlines for several milestones. The project manager explains to Priya that Bob does not do deep dives into the work and usually relies on project managers or their employees to suggest and finalize details. What is the root cause of the misunderstanding?
Lack of leadership
Lack of stakeholder management
Correct answer
Lack of active listening
Lack of cultural awareness
Overall explanation
Active listening includes asking questions in one's own words to confirm understanding or solicit additional information. In this case, a major stakeholder expected someone else to suggest specific components of a project plan for them. A lack of cultural awareness generally occurs when people from different backgrounds overlook contextual clues that might be obvious to people from the same background. A lack of stakeholder management stems from allowing stakeholders to overstep the boundaries necessary for completing a project. A lack of leadership occurs when there is no vision or inspiration to run the project correctly.

An excellent goal to reward your customer service representatives is to introduce incentives for improving the feedback system. This action will enhance the organization's historical issues. Increasing the number of phones sold does not address the issue of feedback for the organization. Taking initiatives to reduce connectivity issues does not address the issue of feedback for the organization.

Ethan has several specialists on his team. What can he most likely expect as they begin work on their agile project?
Ethan can expect the team to require a structured collaboration process to ensure good communication among the specialties.
Correct answer
Ethan can expect bottlenecks as work is waiting for certain specialists.
None of the above
He can expect a high level of efficiency from those specialized in a given area, which will move the work along quickly.
Overall explanation
The most likely issue is that bottlenecks will be created because specialists can create bottlenecks as work has to wait for a role at each stage to provide a required function. Ethan is not as likely to have the other scenarios happen. Having specialists is not more efficient, and there is no specific requirement for collaboration.

Do nothing. The project team is responsible for the retrospective.
Escalate the issue to the team members' functional managers.
Reprimand both team members.
Correct answer
Remind the team that retrospectives are about improving, not assigning blame.
Overall explanation
Retrospectives are intended to allow the team to learn from the past and not intended to assign blame. Samantha should return the focus of the discussion to improvements. Reprimanding the team members will not help refocus the retrospective. Escalating the issue to their managers will also not help as they will still be placing blame.

A Buy More Corporation Business Analyst attends a daily scrum meeting with the core team members. Her boss, the product owner, joins them every other week to assist in sprint and backlog planning.
Correct answer
The Buy More Corporation business and development team members meet briefly face-to-face each morning to discuss new or changing requirements, potential solutions, and alternatives to business requests.
Overall explanation
Frequent face-to-face communication is always preferred over any other communication type but can be difficult to implement with distributed teams. Emails are not the preferred method for team communication. Sending a representative of the product owner, even regularly, is not the preferred method for team communication. Phone calls and written documents are not the preferred methods for team communication.

Project SPA is using the predictive approach to create a new circuit board for printing equipment manufacturers use. The project is on budget and two weeks ahead of schedule. Phil is working with a directive project management office for best practices and advice on how to move forward. While reviewing his project plan, Phil has determined that his team lacks critical knowledge to complete an upcoming activity in the project. The activity is technical but will only take two days to complete. However, if there is an error in this task, it will cost the project $12,000 and at least a week delay. What should Phil do to mitigate this risk?
Correct answer
Work with his project management office to get an expert to advise on this task.
Stop the project work to perform quantitative risk analysis.
Use the management reserves to hire a contractor to handle the task.
Move the task later in the project to free up time for training.
Overall explanation
Using the project management office to support the project will allow Phil to mitigate this risk. The risk has already been quantified – as it will have a cost effect and a week delay. Hiring a contractor to complete the task is risk transference, not mitigation. Mitigation aims to lower the probability and/or impact of the risk event. Moving the task for training is a good second choice, but Phil should consult with the directive PMO before delaying the project and implementing training.

Correct answer
Review the requirements at the next team meeting.
Do nothing. The legal department is responsible for compliance.

Overall explanation
Twila should review the requirements at the next team meeting and ensure everyone is aware of these requirements. This will help ensure the team is staying compliant. Asking a single team member to ensure the project remains in compliance exposes Project L to risks as other team members may stray out of compliance.

Thomas has ensured that all tasks have been properly closed out and that deliverables have been delivered to customers. The vendors have provided the needed documentation, and the project sponsor is happy with the project result, though costs were slightly over budget. What else should Thomas do to close out Project Anchor?
Clear out the backlog.
Correct answer
Ensure all project contracts are closed out.
Determine project velocity.
Finalize quality control.
Overall explanation
Thomas should review all project contracts to ensure they have been properly closed out and have met their terms. Closing all contracts must be completed before the project is officially closed, which can be coordinated with centralized contracting. However, Thomas may have to approve the invoices for payment as part of the organizational framework. Quality control happens before the customers see the result, so it is assumed that this task has been completed already. Given that all tasks have been closed out, there should not be a backlog.

Chris wants to include the epic in the next sprint. What would be the best activity to perform next?
Rolling wave planning
Correct answer
Task decomposition
Incremental development
Business value assessment
Overall explanation
Task decomposition is correct because the epic needs to be broken down into smaller tasks such that some or all of them will fit within the velocity of the upcoming sprint.

Keep satisfied
Correct answer
Manage closely
Keep informed
Monitor
Overall explanation
Christopher should closely manage the upper management team as they have high power and high interest in the project. This group of stakeholders are critical decision-makers within the organization and have the most significant impact on the project's success, and therefore, Christopher must closely manage their expectations. Stakeholders who should be monitored have low power and low interest in the project and should not be bored with excessive communication. Stakeholders who should be kept informed have low power but high interest to avoid significant issues from arising. Stakeholders who should be kept satisfied have high power but low interest to avoid negatively influencing the project.

Shawn is a project manager at a new company. Shawn's default leadership style is servant leadership, which makes Shawn very popular with his team. The team feels as though Shawn supports them in every way and has their success and the team's success as the primary goal. Despite the team's appreciation of Shawn, they often feel like they do not have a clear direction. While they feel Shawn would do anything to support their work, some team members do not have a clear grasp of what should be done and why. What leadership style should Shawn adopt or incorporate into his current style to accommodate his team?
Correct answer
Directing. Shawn should come up with a clear vision and goals.
Laissez-Faire. Since Shawn is popular, he should only get involved when he needs to.
Servant leadership only.  It is selfless and always the best choice.
Autocratic. Shawn should be stricter and just focus on goals.
Overall explanation
Shawn should incorporate directing into his management style. Servant leadership is a great style, but the team will struggle for progress without direction and goals. Directing the team with a vision, goals, instructions, and expectations while retaining his passion for servant leadership is an excellent path for Shawn. Servant leadership is a good model for agile projects, but it is not always the best choice for new project teams or predictive projects. A laissez-faire style would likely frustrate the team further and makes Shawn seem more removed. An autocratic style will nullify the aspect of his management style that is already working.

Now, he must let their project manager, Theodore, know what is happening or risk impacting the project. How should Theodore handle the situation?
Theodore should call a meeting and allow the team members to discuss why they cannot come to a unified decision.
Correct answer
Theodore should bring in a skilled facilitator that can help Max and the team members to overcome bias and resolve the disagreements.
Theodore should dismiss Max's concerns, knowing that all team members are highly skilled and have worked well with each other at this point, believing that it will all work out.
Theodore should sit down with each team member and find out why there has been so much disagreement.
Overall explanation
A skilled facilitator can help the team members reach a unified decision and work out any bias causing the disagreements. This will allow the team members to return their focus to the project and reach a consensus on the project requirements. Face-to-face meetings to discuss issues are a good choice, but this is not the best answer presented. Theodore should not dismiss Max's concerns. There is a risk that is affecting the project and the project manager must deal with the risk before it becomes an issue and delays the project.

Jeff is managing a virtual team spreading across seven countries and six time zones. Of the choices provided, what will make his project most likely to succeed?
Asking each team member to email a status update to the entire team daily.
Correct answer
Providing virtual communication tools like teleconferencing to all team members.
Mandating that all team members' work schedules overlap.
Inviting all team members to attend a co-located work week, once per year.
Overall explanation
Virtual communication tools that allow instant messaging or video conferences are critical to a virtual team's success. These tools allow for seamless communication across distance and time zones. It is likely impossible for Jeff to mandate that his team members' work schedules overlap, especially considering six time zones. While inviting all team members to meet in one place and work together is a great idea, this will not provide sustainable success as it is only done once per year. It is good to have team members provide updates as often as possible; however, email is not the best means. Communicating using virtual tools like teleconferencing or instant messaging is a much better way to communicate across a team that is spread so far out.

The project manager of a large software implementation project just finished a project status meeting. He learned that a crucial piece of the software his team was creating was faulty in the meeting. The news will cause the project to be late by at least one month and will likely cost additional fees for the developers’ time. What is the next step the project manager should take?
Fire the project team member responsible for the mistake.
Complete a root-cause analysis to determine why the problem occurred.
Create a change request for the immediate correction to the software.
Correct answer
Present the news to management and the customer with a solution to resolve the problem.
Overall explanation
The project manager needs to share the news with management and the customers with a solution to fix the problem. The project manager should never go to management with a problem without a solution. Firing the project team member may not be appropriate. In addition, the project manager may not have the authority to release the project team member. Change requests are needed for additions to (or subtractions from) the project scope, not to complete rework. In addition, this answer calls for immediate correction to the software. Root-cause analysis can be helpful, but it should be completed after informing both management and the customer of the problem.

The Chinese members are frustrated with the American team because sometimes they will send a text message to an American team member and will not get an answer until regular office hours resume the next day. Bobby regularly hears complaints from the Chinese team members stating that they experience delays in their work due to this dynamic. The American team members want to help but not at the expense of personal time or creating a culture of constantly being "on-call."  What kind of team conflict is Bobby running into here?
Work ethic
Language barrier
Religious differences
Correct answer
Cultural differences
Overall explanation
The scenario is about an expectation of responsiveness. In Chinese culture, there is more of an expectation of being on call twenty-four hours a day. In China, you should always be near your cell phone. This dynamic exists in the United States, but the expectation is usually clearly stated and as part of the job description. The Chinese team and the American team have different expectations. Bobby can remedy this by talking to both teams about cultural differences and creating a system for the Chinese team to utilize when they encounter a true emergency. Bobby may consider asking one or more American team members to be on call if it is an in-depth enough problem. A language barrier is not the best choice as the scenario is about connecting via the technology, not the language being used in the conversation. Work ethic is not the issue as this communication happens during regular work hours. Religious differences are not presented in the scenario.

Casey could have allowed the team to study for ten minutes before taking the test.

While Casey measured the outcome of a recently provided training, the correct approach would be to assimilate the training into the work being performed; otherwise, it is just wasted time spent on training. This choice does not help the team retain the information or prep them for an exam. Like most education, you will lose the information if you do not use it or stay involved with the topic.

Refer the developers to the steering committee.
Overall explanation
Janessa should encourage the developers to continue their prior agreement. This will help build good faith and will encourage the team to work together. Doing nothing risks the situation escalating. Janessa's position as the moderator is to encourage the developers to continue their prior agreement and work together. Referring the developers to the steering committee is not a good choice as it is Janessa's role and responsibility to work with the team and coach them to a good resolution. Janessa is the scrum master in this scenario, so this is not a valid option.

Hannah has inherited an agile team that was not doing so well. She has two business analysts, five developers, two database administrators, and two testers. What is one of her initial areas of focus?
To work with the team on a solution to focus on the creation of cross-functional skills.
To evaluate each of the team members.
Correct answer
To combine the business analyst and testing functions into cross-functional roles.
Overall explanation
Hannah’s best focus is to work with the team to begin creating generalizing specialists, as no one is performing a general role on her team. The team is not too large for an agile project. It is not an initial responsibility to evaluate the team. She should not decide what to do about functions without discussing them with the team.

Alice is carrying out a new initiative to adopt more agile processes into practices that traditionally use a waterfall approach. Alice has identified the need to change the current schedule management plan template as part of this process. Which of the following components of the template is Alice most likely going to adjust?
Correct answer
The schedule model development, the release and iteration length, and the reporting formats.
The control thresholds, project schedule model maintenance, and the units of measure.
Organizational procedures link, control thresholds, and rules of performance measurement.
The level of accuracy, rules of performance measurement, and project organization charts.
Overall explanation
The question suggests that Alice is currently working on the plan schedule management process. The schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The project schedule model development specifies the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool used to develop the project schedule model. The release and iteration length are used in an adaptive life cycle and is where time-boxes periods for releases, waves, and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward completing a goal, minimizing scope creep as it forces the teams to develop essential features first, then other features when time permits. The reporting formats are where the formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined. All these components are best suited for planning out adaptive life cycles. The other components of the template may need to be changed; however, the other choices listed do not describe the correct answer to the question.

You are the project manager of a large project with 750 stakeholders in your community. You have been tasked with hosting a public forum for the stakeholders to get their input and to field questions. Management wants you to guide the group to buying into the project and to support its goals. You report that you would feel more comfortable if a professional facilitator were involved to keep the meeting running smoothly. What is the primary goal of facilitation?
Correct answer
Guiding the group towards a shared and successful solution.
Making sure that everyone speaks at least once.
Keeping disagreements to a minimum.
Recording meeting minutes for future reference.
Overall explanation
The primary goal of facilitation is ensuring that the group reaches a solution or decision. Recording the meeting minutes is the job of a scribe, not the facilitator. Keeping disagreements to a minimum is not the job of facilitation as disagreements can be insightful to stakeholder concerns about the project. Making sure that everyone speaks once is not possible in all meetings, especially in larger meetings like this one.

James manages a project in which he replenishes his storage of materials and uses his own trademark approach. What type of process is his project utilizing?
An empirical process
An exemplified process
Correct answer
A defined process
A hybrid of both an empirical and defined process
Overall explanation
A defined process is one in which the materials are known and understood and the approach to the solution is known. A good example is a construction project. An empirical process is one in which learning takes place along the way and the path is uncertain. Exemplified is a synonym of empirical, which this approach is not. There is no such thing as a hybrid empirical and defined process, as those are two opposing process types.

Frank is the scrum master for Project Yellow, which is in its third iteration and is on budget. Recently a team member noted that some project tasks appear to depend on deliverables from another project team. The project cannot move forward until the other project team completes their work and supplies Project Yellow with the deliverables. What should Frank do with this information?
Do nothing. The product owner owns the backlog.
Correct answer
Identify the dependencies and track the tasks as much as he can.
Assign a team member to close the gaps.
Have the project team work extra hours to cover the gaps.
Overall explanation
Frank should identify which tasks have missing dependencies and track the work as closely as he can. He should communicate with the project manager of the other project regarding the deliverables that his project is dependent upon to understand and plan the timing for both projects. Doing nothing risks the project missing critical tasks. Working additional hours may not accomplish anything for the team, so this is not a good choice without understanding the dependencies and timing of the other project. Assigning a team member to close the gaps is not optimal as Frank has not yet identified all of the gaps.

Maria is a project manager for her organization. She was recently assigned a project that requires the assembly of a cross-functional team. The team will be comprised of seven members and herself. Maria has asked other project managers for assistance in assembling her team. Why would she ask other project managers for assistance in assembling her team?
Other project managers may have worked with specific team members and can provide knowledge on other team members' skills.
Maria wants the other project managers to like her, so she asks them what they think.
Maria wants to know who the troublemakers are.
Correct answer
Lessons learned and past experiences are important when assembling a team. Other project managers within the organization will be able to provide feedback on prospective team members.
Overall explanation
Tacit knowledge possessed by project managers and documentation from previous projects regarding team members is invaluable when assembling a team. If this information is readily available, it will assist in assembling a team and allow Maria to make an informed decision. This is a good second choice, but the concept is that lessons learned, which are documented, are always more reliable than recollections and preferences. The best choice is not to identify the troublemakers, if there are any, but to learn about the skills of the project team members. Maria's likeability does not stem from asking other project managers for their input. This is not the best option for this question.

Colt is a project manager for the Anew Corporation and he is halfway through his project. This project is under budget and ahead of schedule, but key stakeholders keep adding scope changes to the project. Colt has been able to accommodate the changes so far. Through integrated change control, he has been able to predict the cost, schedule, other effects the changes will have on the project. The stakeholders have paid for their change requests and allowed additional time as needed. However, a recent change request is significant and well outside the scope and vision of the project. How should Cole most appropriately handle this most recent change request?
Ask his project sponsor to stop the behavior as changes are becoming a nuisance in the project.
Make the change request process more difficult for the stakeholders.
He should not do anything. His job is to serve stakeholders, and the change should be approved.
Correct answer
Escalate the change to the project sponsor with a recommendation not to approve the change.
Overall explanation
For significant changes outside of the original project vision, the change should be escalated to the project sponsor with a recommendation not to approve the change. If the organization has a change control board (CCB) that would be helpful in this scenario. While the project manager should work with the stakeholders, not all change requests should be approved. Change requests that are significantly different than the project vision should be discussed with the project sponsor and/or the change control board. Changes may be a nuisance, but changes are expected in projects. Making the change control process more difficult is not a good solution to this problem.

She should hold off on change requests until the end of the current release cycle.
She must limit her comments on new enhancements to two minutes or less in the scrum sessions.
She can discuss these features outside of the scrum session in their team area after the standup.
Correct answer
She is encouraged to think of innovative new features but should not mention them in the scrum.
Overall explanation
Scrum encourages changes, but they should be discussed in the sprint planning session, not in the daily scrum. New enhancements that are not assigned to an iteration should not be mentioned in the scrum sessions. New features should not be mentioned in the team’s area on the same day.

While planning the next milestone, he is informed that one of his teams has been struggling to adapt to the new technology needed to complete the project. Harold knows that several other teams have easily adapted to this technology. What should Harold do next?
Record the lack of knowledge as a risk and inform the steering committee.
Reassign relevant tasks to the stronger teams.
Correct answer
Schedule time for one of the successful teams to mentor the struggling team.
Inform the struggling team that if they do not improve their performance, they will be reprimanded.
Overall explanation
Having a stronger team mentor the weaker team will improve their skillset and foster collaboration among the teams. Reprimanding the team for not adapting to new technology will morally hurt and will not help the team in improvement. While this is a risk to the project, simply recording the risk will not help its mitigation. It is not always feasible to move tasks from one team to another as multi-team projects and programs have different skillsets among the team. In addition, there may not be work capacity to take on additional assignments in the different teams.

While planning communications management, Ricky decides to send a weekly status update email to all stakeholders on Monday and follow up with phone calls as needed. One of Ricky's employees reviews the communication management plan and notes that some stakeholders rarely check their email for status updates. Instead, they are used to having an in-person status meeting every Friday. The employee suggests that it might be easier to get everyone in a room on Friday than get all the stakeholders to read their emails. What aspect of stakeholder collaboration is the project manager evaluating?
Correct answer
Communication means and strategies
Environment and culture
Analytical and assessment techniques
Politics and power structures
Overall explanation
Communication means and strategies are the plans and intentions of communication from the project to the stakeholder. This answer also defines the frequency that stakeholders prefer to interact with the project manager. Politics and power structures constitute a hierarchy of authority within and beyond an organization. Environment and culture entail the way things are commonly done in an organization, such as the organizational framework and reporting structure. Analytics and assessment techniques are important for letting stakeholders apply their metrics for success to project outcomes. None of these are appropriate for communicating to an audience of stakeholders with different preferences.

Forward the email from the client to David.
Write up a formal letter of reprimand for David.
Send a text message to David about the feedback.
Correct answer
Meet with and discuss the feedback with David.
Overall explanation
The product owner should discuss the feedback with David. This is the most personal form of communication and will likely be the most effective way of having David improve in the future. Forwarding the email from the client to David does not resolve the problem as effectively as meeting and talking with David. Writing up a formal letter of reprimand for David does not explain how David can operate better with the client. Sending a text message to David about the feedback is the least effective answer.

The conflict has escalated to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to consider the vendor's termination. How should you try and resolve the conflict and update the CIO on the situation?
Correct answer
Analyze and clarify the problem by developing a problem statement for the agency's vendor and internal resources. The problem statement can be reviewed and agreed upon for issue resolution.
Ensure that the future procurement document provides a terms and definitions section for IT-related terminology to avoid this conflict from happening again.
Ask the vendor to provide documentation that explains the definition of the technology term that is causing the conflict.
Schedule a meeting with the vendor and internal resources to discuss and clarify the issue.
Overall explanation
The best choice is to analyze and clarify the problem by developing a problem statement for the agency's vendor and internal resources. Future procurement documentation may be ideal, but this choice doesn't solve the immediate problem. While a meeting to discuss the issue can work, creating a problem statement for internal and external review is the best choice. Asking the vendor to provide documentation explaining the definition of the technology term causing the conflict isn't the best choice as there's a conflict already regarding the term with the vendor and the buyer.

Correct answer
Add the requirement to the product backlog.
Submit a change request to ask for additional funding for the server.
Update the resource requirements.
Update the issue log.
Overall explanation
The special server will become part of the requirements for the project work to be completed, so it should be added to the product backlog. Submitting a change request to ask for additional funding for the server may be needed, but first, the server requirement should be added to the product backlog. Updating the resource requirements is not the best choice for this agile project.

Overall explanation
Louis should work with the vendor to see if they can negotiate a better fee. This may result in the project saving money while getting their preferred vendor. A cheaper vendor may not be the best fit for Project H. Having the team vote is not ideal as they will likely pick the vendor in question anyway.

Delta is a project manager who is dealing with a project that utilizes a lot of materials. Most of those materials are manufactured in China with a two to three-month lead time. Delta has a team member who does all the purchasing for the project, who recently came to Delta in a panic. The team member explained that it is almost the Chinese New Year, and her orders will be delayed an additional month or more because of this. As the project manager Delta is tasked with helping her buyer resolve this impediment. How should she proceed?
Pause the project until the issue is resolved.
Add an additional month to the project schedule.
Correct answer
Look at rush options with the Chinese manufacturer.
Fire the buyer as this is a fundamental mistake.
Overall explanation
The most viable choice is to ask for rush options with the Chinese manufacturer. There may be a cost increase for the resources and the rush work, but this could keep the project from being delayed and the cost may be worth the time savings. Adding an additional month to the project schedule is not the best immediate choice. Firing the buyer, as this is a fundamental mistake, is not the best choice as the project manager likely would not have the authority to fire the individual. Mistakes, even big mistakes happen, when dealing with other cultures and holidays. This is a good lesson learned for the individual and the project team. Pausing the project until the issue is resolved is not the best choice as the delay will not affect the project work currently but will affect the project downstream.

Overall explanation
Before acting, Yestin should determine the priorities of Project BKL and its stakeholders. This will allow him to best balance their needs. Not all stakeholders carry the same level of importance in project management. The steering committee is unlikely to help with this scenario; this is the project manager's responsibility.

How can Laurie create the change that her senior management has mandated?
Start scrum sprints and let the team experiment with the scrum practices.
Stay with what is successful for this organization.
Slowly introduce scrum practices into current projects.
Correct answer
Mentor key team members in agile and start with small projects.
Overall explanation
Mentorship and starting small is an excellent strategy for the project teams to get used to the agile project management approach. Small projects offer a look into agile, learn by doing, lets the team get confident in the approach, and shows management some quick victories for the organization. Introducing scrum practices into current projects can be disruptive and confusing for new learners. It is best to separate the two ideas rather than try to create a hybrid approach to current projects. Experimenting with scrum practices is fine once the team understands the rules completely. Coaching the team through the process is better than setting the team loose to figure things out on their own. Staying with what works in the organization is an option, but not the best option.

Of all the choices presented, Martha should follow up developer's task, inspect the deliverable and ensure it was completed correctly. Doing nothing risks the task being completed improperly and being non-compliant. Asking another team member to inspect the task is non-ideal as Martha will not have firsthand knowledge.

This task will cost the project an additional $12,000 and will take three weeks to complete. What should Larry do next?
Schedule the task for immediate work.
Correct answer
Submit the task to the change control board.
Do nothing because the team can only work on planned tasks.

Overall explanation
Despite its criticality, Larry should still follow the project's change control processes to ensure the task is properly integrated into the project. Submitting the task for immediate work is not ideal as this likely violates the project's change control process. Sprint reviews are only found in agile projects, and project managers are not used in these types of projects. Doing nothing risks critical work being missed by Project PureAir.

Additionally, Yang facilitates retrospectives every three weeks. Which of the following processes best describes what Yang is performing?
Manage stakeholder engagement
Correct answer
Control schedule
Estimate activity resources
Control scope
Overall explanation
Controlling the schedule is the process of monitoring the project's status to update the project schedule and manage changes to the schedule baseline. For scrum projects, this is performed by reprioritizing the product backlog, determining the velocity for past iterations, adapting the team's work plans accordingly, and performing retrospectives. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout the project. This process is performed throughout the project.

If the changes the stakeholders are requesting at each of the sites are valid requests that should be approved, the project manager should integrate these changes across all installations, not just for the customers who request the changes. If the changes are valid, they should be approved. Changes should be uniform across the project, not piecemeal. Adding the changes later rather than anticipating the change requests is not cost-effective. The project manager should evaluate the changes and implement them as part of the project plan.

James has been assigned as the team leader for a project designed to improve the organization's employees' well-being. For this project, James observes how other big-name companies with low turnover rates treat their employees. A common trend is that employees are granted free lunches and healthcare at the workplace. James presents his findings to the executive team and desires to replicate these processes for their organization. What type of leadership style best describes what James is trying to utilize?
Pacesetting
Correct answer
Affiliative
Laissez-Faire
Authoritative
Overall explanation
James is seeking to employ an affiliative style of leadership. This leadership style places people first and is characterized by leaders who pay attention and support their emotional needs. It also encourages harmony and involves informing collaborative relationships with the team. The authoritative style is characterized by confident leaders who map the way and set expectations while engaging and energizing followers along the way. Leaders also take the time to explain their thinking. The laissez-faire style involves the least amount of oversight from leaders. However, this can lead to a lack of direction for the team if the team is inexperienced. The pacesetting style is for leaders who set the standard that their subordinates need to achieve.

Sean’s team has discovered a missing requirement in their user story. The developer speaks with the person who best can describe what should happen in the scenario discovered. However, that person failed to update their software tracking tool with the updated requirement. Sean knows that he should:
Correct answer
Make sure that this change is discussed in the next standup meeting and not worry as much about the process for their tracking tool.
Ensure that the tool is changed immediately for the best means of communication.
Disallow a change such as this, as new items should always go to the backlog.
Ask that no discussions take place without the involvement of the party most likely to be testing.
Overall explanation
If this missing requirement has a minor impact, it is acceptable to discuss and not worry about the process of changing the tool. People over processes is a core focus of agile. There is no agile requirement that documentation needs to be updated immediately, as the team decides the level of documentation needed and processes around it. There is no rule about requirements related to the involvement of the party testing. There is no rule about a potentially minor change going to the backlog.

Frank is the scrum master for Project Minnesota, which is in its first iteration. Frank talked with the team about acceptable behavior in the team's space during a recent team meeting. Why would Frank dedicate time to this topic?
It was on the agenda.
To single out a troublemaker.
Because the team has been misbehaving.
Correct answer
To help reinforce a positive working environment.
Overall explanation
By reviewing what is acceptable and not acceptable, Frank is reinforcing a positive working environment. It is sometimes necessary to define what is acceptable and not acceptable in the public workspace; for example, listening to music without headphones or loud conversations are a distraction and rude. A scrum master should create and reinforce a positive working environment. It is not likely that the team is misbehaving, and even in that case, it would not be the most likely reason for Frank to have this discussion with the team. A single member of the team causing trouble would not be a likely reason for Frank to have a discussion of this type with the team. This topic being on the agenda is not the best reason to cover this topic.

Recently Anderson noticed one of his team members marked a task as completed but did not follow the proper closing processes. What should Anderson do?
Do nothing. The team will hold this individual accountable.
Correct answer
Privately speak with this team member about following the closing process.
Report this behavior to the individual's manager.
Call out the team member publicly.
Overall explanation
Anderson should privately speak with this team member and remind him about following the closing procedures. This will help the team member be accountable and keep correct behavior. Doing nothing risks other tasks being completed improperly as it sets a bad example. Reporting this individual to his manager may not help him to improve or prevent future violations.

Correct answer
Focusing on an area like individuals and interactions is more valuable than focusing on other values like processes and tools.
Focusing on an area like individuals and interactions is valuable, whereas focusing on other values like processes and tools is not.
Only those who fully understand the 12 principles of an agile mindset can be permitted to review the four values.
A prioritized focus on all eight values compared is the best approach to agile success.
Overall explanation
A focus on a value that is stated to be over another value means that the value of the item that is over the other is more important, but it does not imply that the value it is over is not important at all. There is no implication that only the four values are important, and the others are not important. There is no need to focus on all eight areas, as one of each pair is the value to focus on, while the other deserves lesser focus. The four values can be reviewed on their own, although ideally both the four values and 12 principles are both reviewed together.

Correct answer
32 weeks

Overall explanation
The best choice is 32 weeks. If each iteration or sprint lasts for four weeks and the velocity is 28 user story points, you'd divide the velocity into the total story points in the backlog, which is 220.

To foster a team environment to deliver value effectively.
To measure the realization of the business value.
To be clear about the business value of the project.
Correct answer
To understand the project vision.
Overall explanation
Understanding the vision of the project is the first step to delivering business value. For the upcoming meeting, the sponsor should be able to identify their idea of the project. This vision should include a high-level view of the project's scope and why the water piping project was created. Fostering a team environment is the project manager's responsibility to generate deliverables.

Alice is starting a project that will last at least two years. Her project team is full-time, and barring any unusual circumstances, they will all continue with her. She may also need to add to her team. The company, in general, is in decline, and morale throughout the company is low. Alice is well-liked, but she hears rumbling from the team. The team does not see the project's value, and they do not like the fact that they were pulled from their regular jobs for this assignment. The team is worried about the long-term prospects of the company. They wonder if this is a true project, if they have been put on a "special project" or are being sunsetted somehow. How should Alice handle this fundamental problem?
Avoidance
Smoothing
Correct answer
Confrontation or problem solving
Compromising
Overall explanation
Alice should tackle this issue head-on. Alice needs a fully engaged project team. Alice should confront the mood of the room and address it directly. Alice needs to let her team know that the project is important to the organization's future. The team needs to know that they were chosen for the project based on their skill set and the project's desired results. Alice needs to work with her team to remove this malaise and replace it with optimism and a shared spirit in getting the job done. Smoothing or avoidance will fuel the project team's fire as they are already filled with anxiety and suspicion. The team will not appreciate an approach that does not address the issue directly. Avoidance is the opposite choice of confronting the problem. The team and Alice need to work together to address the issue, not avoid it. Alice should not take a compromising approach as the solution is where both parties give up something to find a solution, even if neither party is completely happy with the decision.

All four developers agree on one technical path.
Three developers agree on one technical path, and the fourth does not support the decision but is willing to accept the decision.
Correct answer
The team cannot agree, so the project manager must decide for the team.
Two developers support one option while the other two support another but are willing to try a common solution.
Overall explanation
Without agreement and willingness to support a decision, there is no consensus. Therefore, the team not reaching an agreement, and having the project manager decide for them is not consensus. All four developers agreeing on one technical path is the purest form of consensus. Three developers agreeing on one technical path, and the fourth not supporting the decision but being willing to accept the decision is a consensus to move forward with one direction.

However, this week, two of the key stakeholders, John and Tina, came to you demanding that you change some aspects of the scope statement. What should you do? (Choose the best answer.)
Refuse to make any changes because the scope cannot be changed once it has been approved.
Refuse to make any changes, but refer the stakeholders to your project sponsor.
Refuse to make any changes because the scope has already been approved.
Correct answer
Refuse to make any changes, but have the stakeholders complete a change request form.
Overall explanation
A change request form will allow the request to be documented, considered, approved, or declined. In some instances, the project manager may document the change request for the stakeholders. Note that choice C is the best answer for this question, but it is not what you would normally do in your role as a project manager as you would normally document the change request yourself. This is not a correct statement about the circumstances described. Scope statements can be changed if the need is appropriate.

$4,225,000
$4,500,000
Correct answer
0.66
$3,000,000

Danny recently inherited a project management office. It is efficient and has some good project managers, but they all view each other as competition. Danny's predecessor fostered this dynamic by creating scorecards for each project manager and their teams. The scores were publicly shared and he held contests among which team could perform the best. Whichever team performed the best received a project bonus, while the other teams received a warning to perform better. Friendly competition is good, but not all projects have the same challenges and skillsets. Some of the project managers felt they were punished for things outside of their control. As a result of this environment, project managers seem to be out only for their own careers and are not willing to help other project managers and teams. What should Danny do next?
Correct answer
Create a development plan where everyone can win.
Move all the project managers to new teams every month.
Fuel the competition since projects are being successfully completed.
Mentor the more open-minded project managers and ask them to coach other teams.
Overall explanation
While healthy competition is good, this dynamic is not. A mentor should not view his team as competition and should not deliberately pit people against each other. Of all the options, the best choice is to create a plan where everyone can win. Fueling the competition is not a good idea. This scenario is a zero-sum reward, where most people lose and only one set of people win. This can create resentment in the organization and that can lead to more issues. Choosing only the amenable project managers to mentor other project managers may create more division and resentment. Moving the project managers every month is not a good option as the move could interrupt current projects.

You have just taken over a project that is several months late and is in unbelievably bad shape. The previous project manager had not kept accurate records on the project work, project expenses, or the project's overall performance. The customer is still very interested in having the project completed and is not holding you responsible for the project work up to this point. Of the following choices, which one is the best solution to move forward and to create accurate records of your progress?
Create a new project plan.
Scrap the project and start over.
Create a work authorization system.
Correct answer
Rebaseline the project.
Overall explanation
Rebaselining the project is probably the best solution in this instance because the project is in such disarray. This also enables the project manager to record and compare work actions from this point forward. The customer does not want to cancel the project. Although a work authorization system is needed, it is not the solution to this problem. The question does not indicate that the project plan is bad or has not been appropriately implemented.

Multiple project teams at Standard Technologies have been using a variety of project management methodologies. The teams must use several different software to track their time, costs of materials, and the utilization of the resources. The teams have a unified complaint that this is causing an impediment due to the continual time it takes to document the same information differently. As the lead project manager, what should you do to remove this impediment?
Have a meeting that allows members to cast votes on what methodology is to be adapted across all projects.
Correct answer
Ascertain which tools and information can be used to provide appropriate governance of all teams.
Inform all teams that there will be no project progression until they can stop complaining and reach a solution.
Tell the team that this is how it has been done and that there is no need for change, citing that the redundancy ensures accuracy.
Overall explanation
Collaborative governance that allows for the effective use of human, financial, and physical resources can significantly impact a project. Multiple software to track common project resources and time can become burdensome for the project team and make the project information ineffective, unreliable, and cause frustration for the people involved in the project. Telling the team that this is how it has been done and that there is no need for change does not acknowledge the concern or the risk the current process has on the project team. A meeting to vote on what methodology is to be adapted across all projects is a good choice, but the best answer is for the project managers to work together to choose a software that can unify the process. The teams voting for a solution does include their feedback and opinions, but this answer assumes the team already knows the available options. Threatening the project team does not address their concerns and frustration, and this is answer can be seen as punitive. Threatening to stop project progress also is not good to keep moving forward.

Correct answer

Overall explanation
Helen should determine what dependencies are missing with the development team and then add appropriate tasks to develop those capabilities. She should also work with the product owner to adjust the place the stories have in the roadmap to ensure the dependencies would be completed in time. Removing those stories is not ideal, as this will change what Project Super delivers. Deprioritizing the stories is not a good choice as the product owner has prioritized the product backlog based on the value the stories will bring the organization.

During the meeting on Friday, the team took more time to complete their update, pushing the meeting outside of the timebox designated for the meeting. What can William do to fix this situation?
Correct answer
Change the meeting back to a daily standup meeting.
Allow the team to provide an update on their tasks via email before the meeting on Friday.
Change the format and the timebox for the meeting.
Conduct a training class with the team and discuss how to deliver meeting updates efficiently.

The daily standup meeting is already timeboxed to 15 minutes and should happen every day. The meeting addresses three questions: What did you do since we last met? What are you doing today? Are there any impediments preventing you from moving forward? Allowing the team to provide an update on their tasks via email before the meeting on Friday is not the best choice as Scrum utilizes the daily standup and has a prescribed timebox and format. Changing the format and the timebox for the meeting is necessary, but the best choice is to follow the guidelines of Scrum with the daily standup meeting.

Pairing Pedro and Jesse together to work on the project is the best choice as Jesse listens to Pedro and they get along well. In this scenario, it is best to allow Pedro to coach Jesse. Telling everyone that they must remember the team charter and ground rules is important for the project manager to do.

Jordan should wait to celebrate project completion until the project is completely closed.

Question 173

Maria is a product owner for the GEOAPP project. During a recent sprint planning meeting, her scrum master, Ted, has advised that prioritizing an emergent task indicated by the development team will prevent future work. The development team has said that this user story will require 12 of the available 30 story points. Prioritizing this task would result in several essential user stories being moved to future sprints. What should Maria do?
Add the new task to the backlog after the user stories are completed.
Correct answer
Work with Ted to understand the new task and prioritize it accordingly.
Refuse to add the new task to the backlog.
Remove every story except the new task from the next sprint.
Overall explanation
Maria should work with Ted to fully understand this new task's impact and then prioritize it accordingly. This will allow the team to address the issue and continue work on user stories in the current or future sprints. Refusing to add this task to the backlog exposes the project to risks. Adding the task to the backlog after the stories are completed will not resolve the blocker and puts the project at risk. Removing every story is not necessary as the team has sized the user story at 12 of 30 available story points.

Zebra Trout, Inc. has hired you to create a Project Management Office (PMO). One of your first orders of business is to develop a team charter with a project team. Team members have voiced that they do not understand what a team charter is or why there is a need for one. The team argues that there is already an employee handbook that outlines expected behavior within the organization. What do you do to address their opinions?
Correct answer
Call a meeting to develop the team charter and outline the importance of it for a functioning PMO.
Ignore them. You have been tasked with creating the PMO and have authority over the team.
Do not develop a team charter. They are right; the employee handbook is well written, and overall, from what you have seen, they all work well with others.
Tell management that there is no way that you can create a PMO with your current employees' attitudes.
Overall explanation
Team members may not fully understand why a team charter is essential and integral to the PMO. By explaining and outlining what a team charter is and why it is a crucial part of a successful PMO, you allow them to help grow the company while assisting them in understanding what is expected. A team charter outlines the behavior of the project team members, and by having these guidelines set from the beginning, the PMO is being set up for success. Ignoring the team is never a good option. You need to educate the team and address their concerns about the project charter. The employee handbook is a different document than the team charter. The team charter is specific to the teams in the PMO and offers project-specific guidelines. Reporting the team to management is not the best strategy. You need to meet and educate the project team on the importance of the team charter.

Julene is the scrum master for Project Roberston, which is just ending its first iteration and has completed twenty-seven story points of work. The team is relatively new to scrum, but they have been doing well with the new approach. Some team members have reported they want to try new things in the development but are unsure how to ask for the change in the process. Other team members like the daily scrum meetings. What should Julene do next?
Release the project team.
Correct answer
Coach the team for the sprint review.
Perform planning poker.
Update Project' R's velocity.
Overall explanation
The next activity is the sprint review. As this is the first iteration and the team is new to the agile approach, Julene should coach the team on the steps to take next in the project, which is to do the sprint review. The project's velocity will set itself over time. Planning poker is used to estimate the story point value of user stories. Unless the project is completed after a single iteration, which is doubtful, it would not be a good idea to release the project team.

Karen is a new project assistant on your team and you are the project manager. After a brainstorming session with key stakeholders regarding risk management, you ask Karen to quickly assess the impacts of what you believe are the twelve most significant risks on the rest of the project. What are you asking Karen to do in this scenario?
Integrated Risk Management
Correct answer
Qualitative Risk Analysis
Customized Risk Management
Continual improvement
Overall explanation
You have asked Karen to perform a qualitative risk analysis, which is a quick analysis of the probability and impact of the risk event on the project. All risks should be assessed for their impact on the rest of the project, including the external, political, cultural, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors. The integrated principal is where risk management is performed throughout the organization. The risk management framework and process are customized and proportionate to the organization's external and internal context related to its objectives. The continual improvement element describes risk management as being continually improved through learning and experience.

Billy has just taken over a project in execution. During his second week, he notices that his team members have spent a lot of time working on requests from many different project stakeholders. Due to these distractions, the team has been unable to focus on their assigned tasks. This has caused the project to fall behind. What action should Billy take first?
Advise team members to ignore all unexpected requests as it is not their responsibility.
Correct answer
Document and communicate integrated change control to all stakeholders.
Request for the team to complete these requests as soon as possible so they can focus on their assigned work.
Inform team members to forward all these requests to Billy.
Overall explanation
Billy should document and communicate the project's integrated change control process to capture and examine all proposed project changes. Stakeholders should not directly contact the team members as this is not the most efficient use of their time. Advising team members to ignore all requests may result in ignoring valid requests, reducing project value, or harming relationships. Having the team members complete the requests a soon as possible may result in the request generating no project value. Having the team members forward the requests to Billy may be inefficient because the requests may be valid, and the project team members would be the only individuals who can complete the request. Billy must communicate the integrated change control process to better manage frequent changes from stakeholders.

Thelma is the project manager for Project Raindrop, which recently completed a major milestone. The project has strict quality requirements for compliance, and Thelma must inspect the work before the customer accepts what has been created. After inspecting the deliverable, Thelma has determined a deliverable can be passed onto the business for use. What additional steps should Thelma take?
Correct answer
Ensure there is appropriate documentation for the deliverables.
Perform quality control.
Do nothing. The deliverable is complete.
Closeout all tasks related to the deliverable.
Overall explanation
Before passing the deliverable over to the business, Thelma should ensure it is adequately documented, transferring knowledge to the business. This will help set the business up for success. Closing out all tasks related to the deliverable is performed before the milestone is completed. Quality control is performed when the deliverable is being created to confirm the deliverable meets the expected quality. Doing nothing will result in knowledge not being transferred.

Frances is a project manager for Hydro Corporation and was placed on a team where Janet, the project manager, went on paternity leave. When assessing the project documentation, the RACI chart had an "A" next to Janet's name for all the tasks. The other team members share responsibility, consult, and inform. What should Frances do?
Frances should evaluate the issue log, determine if the RACI chart is correct, and put his name next to Janet's.
Frances should replace Janet's name on the RACI chart with another team member's name.
Frances should put his name next to Janet's name on the RACI chart.
Correct answer
Frances should evaluate the project, determine if the RACI chart is correct, and replace Janet's name with his name.
Overall explanation
The RACI chart defines the responsibility assignment matrix that uses the legend of RACI for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. Because Frances is now serving as the project manager, he will review the chart for accuracy and put his name next to Janet's name. This signals that Frances now assumes the RACI designations for the activities previously assigned to Janet. Frances should put his name next to Janet's name on the RACI chart only after reviewing the chart for accuracy. Replacing Janet's name with a team member's name would effectively assign project management duties to a team member, so this option is incorrect. The issue log is not relevant to the assignment and roles identified in the RACI chart, so this is not the best choice presented.

Dave is a project manager for LGN, Inc. and has determined that Sam, one of his team members, is not working as efficiently as other members of his team. During Sam's last performance evaluation, Dave emphasized to Sam the importance of improving his communication. After a careful review of Sam's current performance, it was determined that his communication had improved significantly, but now he is working slower as a result. Dave should:
Do nothing and see if the situation improves on the next evaluation.
Tell the other team members that Sam is working slower because he is meticulous with his communication.
Let Sam know that his communication is better, but now he is working too slowly.
Correct answer
Continue working with Sam to strengthen his communication style, increase his efficiency, and evaluate the project's status.
Overall explanation
As a project manager and a leader, Dave's responsibility is to increase his team members' performance. If Sam is working to improve deficiencies established in a formal review, Dave should continue to invest effort in helping Sam. However, if the project is suffering due to Sam's inability to do the work, a decision must be made regarding improving the project's outcome. This choice will make Sam feel like no matter what he does for Dave is wrong. It takes time to do the work, but it is also time-consuming to communicate effectively. Dave needs to continue working with Sam on both issues. Telling the other team members that Sam is working slower because he is meticulous with his communication is not the best choice as this can embarrass Sam. Do nothing is often the worst thing you can do in project management.
