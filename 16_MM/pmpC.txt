    Functional structures require the project team members to report directly to the functional manager.

    Matrix Organization:
    • There are three matrix structures: weak, balanced, and strong. 
    The different structures are reflective of the project manager's authority in relation to the functional manager's authority.

    Project Oriented Organizations, (Projectized):
    • Structure where the PM has the greatest amount of authority. The project team is assigned to the project on a full-time basis.

Section 5:Project Management Principles
=============================================
PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
Project vs. General Management Principles

12 Principles:
1. Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward(জনসভা-সংগঠনের ভারপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি, যাত্রীসেবক)
    STEWARDSHIP: “ The act of taking care of or managing  something, for example property, an organization, money or valuable objects .

Stewards act sensibly to carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness while keeping compliance 
with internal and external guidelines.
They demonstrate a broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental impacts of the projects they support. 

Stewardship has responsibilities both within and external to the company.



2. Create a collaborative project team environment
TEAM: Projects are done by project teams.

Project teams are made up of people who have diverse(বিভিন্ন) skills, knowledge, and experience.
Project teams that work collaboratively can finish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than 
individuals working on their own.

Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often establishing their own “local” culture.

A collaborative project team environment facilitates:
    • Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines,
    • Individual and team learning and development, and
    • Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.


 3. Effectively engage with  stakeholders
    Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satisfaction.
Stakeholders impact projects, performance, and outcomes.
Project teams work for other stakeholders by engaging with them.
Stakeholder engagement proactively improves value delivery.

Engagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions.

Project teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential negative impacts 
and maximize positive impacts.


4. Focus on value:
Value is the ultimate indicator(চূড়ান্ত সূচক) of project success.

Value can be realized throughout(সর্বত্র) the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete.
Value, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.


5. Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions
SYSTEMS THINKING
A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole.
A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity.

    A project works within larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits.

    As projects unfold, internal and external conditions continuously change, and a single change can create several impacts. 

    Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system. 

    The project system often brings together a diverse team engaged in working towards a common objective.



6. Demonstrate(প্রদর্শন) leadership behaviors

LEADERSHIP:
Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs.
Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes.
Any project team member can demonstrate leadership behaviors.
Leadership is different than authority.
Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation.
Effective leaders recognize differences in motivation among project team members.
Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.

Leadership should not be confused with authority. Authority is the right to exercise power and control individuals.

It takes leadership to motivate people toward a common goal, inspire them to align their individual interests in favor 
of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.

Projects work best when leaders understand that motivates people.


7. Tailor based on context

Each project is unique. Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives,
stakeholders, governance, and the environment.

Tailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its environment
A tailored project approach can produce benefits, such as:
    Deeper commitment from project team members
    Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources
    Customer-oriented focus
    More efficient use of project resources



8. Build quality into processes and deliverables
Quality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the following:
    Performance
    Conformity
    Reliability
    Resilience
    Satisfaction
    Efficiency
    Sustainability
Teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria. 
The objective is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives of the customer and other relevant stakeholders.



9. Navigate complexity:

COMPLEXITY
Complexity is the outcome of human behavior, system interactions, uncertainty, and ambiguity. 
Complexity can arise at any point during the project. 
Constantly evaluate and navigate project complexity so that approaches and plans enable the project team to successfully 
navigate the entire project.

Some of the more common sources of complexity are:
    Human behavior
    System behavior
    Uncertainty and ambiguity
    Technological innovation



10. Optimize risk responses:
Risk responses should be:
    Appropriate for the significance of the risk,
    Cost effective,
    Realistic within the project context,
    Agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and
    Owned by a responsible person.
Project team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds.



11. Embrace/Hug adaptability and resiliency(অভিযোজনযোগ্যতা এবং স্থিতিস্থাপকতা)
    Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
    Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure.
    Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization’s and project team’s approaches.
    A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability.
    A project rarely performs exactly as initially planned.
    Projects are influenced by internal and external factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, 
    among other factors—which exist in a system of interactions.



12. Enable change to achiev
Remaining relevant in today’s business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations.
Change in an organization can originate from internal sources and external sources.
Enabling change in an organization can be challenging.
Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one.

Change can originate from internal influences or external sources.
Enabling change can be challenging as not all stakeholders embrace change.
Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.

Section 6: Project Management Domains - 3PMDomains.pdf
=============================================
Domains are a group of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes.
They are interactive, interrelated, and interdependent areas of focus that work in unison to achieve desired project outcomes.


Principles and Performance Domain:
    The specific activities undertaken within each of the performance domains are determined by the context
of the organization, the project, deliverables, the project team, stakeholders, and other factors.



Stakeholder performance domain:
    Stakeholders who are project beneficiaries are supportive and satisfied while stakeholders
who may oppose the project or its deliverables do not negatively impact project outcomes.

Effective Stakeholder Engagement
Identify
◦ Identification is done throughout the project to understand who your stakeholders are, both internal and external.
Understand and Analyze
◦ the project manager and the project team should seek to understand stakeholders’ feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values.

◦ Decision making.
◦ Conflict management





Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with the development approach, cadence(সুরপ্রবাহ), and life cycle phases of the project.
Delivery cadence refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables.

Projects can have a single delivery, multiple deliveries, or periodic deliveries.
A development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product,
service, or result during the project life cycle.

Three common approaches includes:
◦ Predictive approach
◦ Adaptive approach, including both iterative and incremental
◦ Hybrid approach

There are several factors that influence the selection of a development approach.
◦ Product, service, or result
◦ Degree of innovation
◦ Requirements certainty
◦ Scope stability

Planning Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with the initial, ongoing, and evolving organization and coordination necessary 
for delivering project deliverables and outcomes.
The purpose of planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project deliverables.

Outcomes includes:
◦ The project moves in an organized, coordinated, and deliberate manner.
◦ There is a holistic approach to providing the project outcomes.
◦ Evolving information is elaborated.
◦ Time spent planning is appropriate.
◦ Planning is sufficient to manage stakeholder expectations.
◦ There is a process for the adaptation of plans.





Project Work Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with establishing project processes, managingphysical resources, 
and fostering a learning environment..

Project work is connected with establishing the processes and performing the work done by the
project team to deliver the expected deliverables   and outcomes.


Project work keeps the project team dedicated and project activities running correctly. 

This includes but is not limited to:
◦ Managing the flow of existing, new and change work.
◦ Keeping the project team focused

project was undertaken to achieve.

Outcomes includes:
    Projects contribute to business objectives
    Projects realize the outcomes
    Project benefits are realized in the time frame
    The project team has an understanding of requirements.
    Stakeholders accept and are satisfied with project deliverables.

Project delivery is about meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations to produce the expected deliverable.


Some project deliver value throughout and others deliver the bulk at the end.
The project manager will need to understand how the deliverable is able to
deliver value to the stakeholders. 
This includes:
◦ Requirements gathering.
◦ Evolving and discovering requirements
◦ Managing requirements
◦ Define and decompose the scope
◦ Completion of deliverables





Measurement Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with assessing project performance and taking
appropriate actions to maintain acceptable performance.
Outcomes includes:
◦ A reliable understanding of the status of the project.
◦ Actionable data to enable decision making.
◦ Timely and appropriate actions to keep the project on track.
◦ Achieving targets and generating business value

Measures are used for multiple reasons, including:
    Evaluating performance compared to plan
    Tracking the utilization of resources
    Demonstrating accountability
    Providing information to stakeholders
    Assessing whether project deliverables are on track
    Ensuring the project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria.
Creating effective measurements helps to ensure the right things are measured.

Ways to measure performance include:
◦ Key Performance Indicators (KPI) - two types of  KPIs: leading indicators and lagging indicators.
◦ Leading indicators predict changes or trends in the project
◦ Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events. They provide information after the fact.




Uncertainty Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty.

Effective execution of this performance domain results in the following desired outcomes:
◦ An awareness of the environment in which projects occur
◦ Proactively exploring and responding to uncertainty.
◦ An awareness of the interdependence of multiple variables on the project.
◦ The capacity to anticipate threats and opportunities
◦ Project delivery with little or no negative impact
◦ Opportunities are realized to improve project performance and outcomes.
◦ Cost and schedule reserves are utilized

Projects happen in environments with varying degrees of uncertainty.
Uncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not knowing or unpredictability.
Uncertainty presents threats and opportunities that project teams explore, assess, and decide how to handle.

     It should include all the software and hardware tools that we need to manage
      the project from start to finish.
     Includes the work authorization system and the configuration management system



82. Change Request
 Proposal to change a document, deliverable, or baseline
 Can include a request to add or remove work from the scope, finish the project faster, or complete the project more cheaply

Implements:
     Corrective action: is something that’s taken to ensure that the project gets back on track.
     Preventive action: is something you put in place to ensure the project stays on track.
     Defect repair is done to fix a broken component on a project, such as if network switch memory fails on a network upgrade project.




83. Work Performance Data, Info and report

Work Performance Data:
     Work performance data is simply raw data
     It is the status of the work that was done but does not have any analysis applied to it.
     It is not useful by itself.
     Usually outputs of executing processes

Work Performance Information:
     Information of the work that was performed compared to the plan
     It gives you actual status about the deliverables
     Work performance information is usually the output of most monitoring and controlling processes

Work Performance Report:
     overall status report of the actual project
     It takes all the work performance information and puts it together into one comprehensive document
     You take the work performance data and compare it against the plan to come up with the work performance information. 
    Then you take all the work performance information and create the work performance reports. 
    In short, data feeds info and all theinfo creates reports.
