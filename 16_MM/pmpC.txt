18) Project Management approaches:
    Two primary approaches: predictive (also known as traditional or waterfall) and adaptive (also known as agile or iterative).

Predictive Approach: The predictive approach follows a linear and sequential process.
    • It involves detailed planning and documentation upfront, with a focus on predicting and defining the project scope,
      objectives, timeline, and deliverables.
    • Extensive upfront planning.
    • Sequential execution.
    • Emphasis on control and documentation:

19) Organizational Structures:
    Functional Organizations:
    • Structure that groups staff members according to their area of expertise (sales, marketing, construction, etc.). 
    Functional structures require the project team members to report directly to the functional manager.

    Matrix Organization:
    • There are three matrix structures: weak, balanced, and strong. 
    The different structures are reflective of the project manager's authority in relation to the functional manager's authority.

    Project Oriented Organizations, (Projectized):
    • Structure where the PM has the greatest amount of authority. The project team is assigned to the project on a full-time basis. 
    When the project is complete, the project team members moves on to  other assignments within the organization.

    Hybrid:

Section 5:Project Management Principles
=============================================
PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct - Project vs. General Management Principles

12 Principles:
1. Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward(জনসভা-সংগঠনের ভারপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি, যাত্রীসেবক)
    STEWARDSHIP: “ The act of taking care of or managing  something, for example property, an organization, money or valuable objects .

Stewards act sensibly to carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness while keeping compliance 
with internal and external guidelines.
They demonstrate a broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental impacts of the projects they support. 

Stewardship has responsibilities both within and external to the company.




2. Create a collaborative project team environment
TEAM: Projects are done by project teams.

Project teams are made up of people who have diverse(বিভিন্ন) skills, knowledge, and experience.
Project teams that work collaboratively can finish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than 
individuals working on their own.
Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often establishing their own “local” culture.

A collaborative project team environment facilitates:
    • Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines,
    • Individual and team learning and development, and
    • Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.


 3. Effectively engage with  stakeholders
    Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satisfaction.
Stakeholders impact projects, performance, and outcomes.
Project teams work for other stakeholders by engaging with them.
Stakeholder engagement proactively improves value delivery.

Engagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions.

Project teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential negative impacts 
and maximize positive impacts.


4. Focus on value:
Value is the ultimate indicator(চূড়ান্ত সূচক) of project success.

Value can be realized throughout(সর্বত্র) the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete.
Value, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.


5. Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions
SYSTEMS THINKING
A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole.
A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity.

    A project works within larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits.

    As projects unfold, internal and external conditions continuously change, and a single change can create several impacts. 

    Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system. 

    The project system often brings together a diverse team engaged in working towards a common objective.



6. Demonstrate(প্রদর্শন) leadership behaviors

LEADERSHIP:
Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs.
Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes.
Any project team member can demonstrate leadership behaviors.
Leadership is different than authority.
Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation.
Effective leaders recognize differences in motivation among project team members.
Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.

Leadership should not be confused with authority. Authority is the right to exercise power and control individuals.

It takes leadership to motivate people toward a common goal, inspire them to align their individual interests in favor 
of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.

Projects work best when leaders understand that motivates people.


7. Tailor based on context

Each project is unique. Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives,
stakeholders, governance, and the environment.

Tailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its environment
A tailored project approach can produce benefits, such as:
    Deeper commitment from project team members
    Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources
    Customer-oriented focus
    More efficient use of project resources



8. Build quality into processes and deliverables
Quality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the following:
    Performance
    Conformity
    Reliability
    Resilience
    Satisfaction
    Efficiency
    Sustainability
Teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria. 
The objective is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives of the customer and other relevant stakeholders.



9. Navigate complexity:

COMPLEXITY
Complexity is the outcome of human behavior, system interactions, uncertainty, and ambiguity. 
Complexity can arise at any point during the project. 
Constantly evaluate and navigate project complexity so that approaches and plans enable the project team to successfully 
navigate the entire project.

Some of the more common sources of complexity are:
    Human behavior
    System behavior
    Uncertainty and ambiguity
    Technological innovation



10. Optimize risk responses:
Risk responses should be:
    Appropriate for the significance of the risk,
    Cost effective,
    Realistic within the project context,
    Agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and
    Owned by a responsible person.
Project team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds.



11. Embrace/Hug adaptability and resiliency(অভিযোজনযোগ্যতা এবং স্থিতিস্থাপকতা)
    Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
    Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure.
    Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization’s and project team’s approaches.
    A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability.
    A project rarely performs exactly as initially planned.
    Projects are influenced by internal and external factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, 
    among other factors—which exist in a system of interactions.



12. Enable change to achiev
Remaining relevant in today’s business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations.
Change in an organization can originate from internal sources and external sources.
Enabling change in an organization can be challenging.
Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one.

Change can originate from internal influences or external sources.
Enabling change can be challenging as not all stakeholders embrace change.
Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.

◦ Decision making.
◦ Conflict management





4) Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with the development approach, cadence(সুরপ্রবাহ), and life cycle phases of the project.
Delivery cadence refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables.

Projects can have a single delivery, multiple deliveries, or periodic deliveries.
A development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product,
service, or result during the project life cycle.

Three common approaches includes:
◦ Predictive approach
◦ Adaptive approach, including both iterative and incremental
◦ Hybrid approach

There are several factors that influence the selection of a development approach.

project was undertaken to achieve.

Outcomes includes:
    Projects contribute to business objectives
    Projects realize the outcomes
    Project benefits are realized in the time frame
    The project team has an understanding of requirements.
    Stakeholders accept and are satisfied with project deliverables.

Project delivery is about meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations to produce the expected deliverable.


Some project deliver value throughout and others deliver the bulk at the end.
The project manager will need to understand how the deliverable is able to
deliver value to the stakeholders. 
This includes:
◦ Requirements gathering.
◦ Evolving and discovering requirements
◦ Managing requirements
◦ Define and decompose the scope
◦ Completion of deliverables





8) Measurement Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with assessing project performance and taking
appropriate actions to maintain acceptable performance.
Outcomes includes:

Measures are used for multiple reasons, including:
    Evaluating performance compared to plan
    Tracking the utilization of resources
    Demonstrating accountability
    Providing information to stakeholders
    Assessing whether project deliverables are on track
    Ensuring the project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria.
Creating effective measurements helps to ensure the right things are measured.

Ways to measure performance include:
◦ Key Performance Indicators (KPI) - two types of  KPIs: leading indicators and lagging indicators.
◦ Leading indicators predict changes or trends in the project
◦ Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events. They provide information after the fact.




9) Uncertainty Performance Domain:
    Deals with activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty.

Effective execution of this performance domain results in the following desired outcomes:
◦ An awareness of the environment in which projects occur
◦ Proactively exploring and responding to uncertainty.
◦ An awareness of the interdependence of multiple variables on the project.
◦ The capacity to anticipate threats and opportunities
◦ Project delivery with little or no negative impact
◦ Opportunities are realized to improve project performance and outcomes.

    Data Representation
    Decision Making

Data Gathering:
     Gather data about a particular process that you’re working on.
     On certain processes, you will need to gather additional
      data before coming up with an output for that process.

 Methods:
    Brainstorming: Brainstorming is when you bring together a group of stakeholders to get ideas and analyze them.
    Brainstorming sessions are generally facilitated by the project manager.

    Interviews: Any time you want to gather data from a particula stakeholders, one of the best methods is to just interview them.
    Ask them a series of questions and talk with them about their thoughts and views.

    Focus groups: A focus group is when you bring together subject matter experts to understand their perspectives 
    and how they would go about solving problems.

    Checklist: A checklist is generally created by the organization and then given to potential stakeholders on a project 
    for them to identify items they may want on a project, things they may not want on the project, 
    and some success criteria they may have for the project.

    Questionnaires and surveys: Questionnaires and surveys can be given to stakeholders to better understand what they may
    be looking for on a project and to better understand their needs.


Data Analysis:
To analyze the data that has been gathered
 Methods:
    Alternative analysis: Alternative analysis involves looking at different options or ways to accomplish something.
    Root cause analysis (RCA): A root cause analysis is used to identify the main underlining reason for particular event.
    Variance(ভিন্নতা) analysis: Variance analysis is used quite often to find the exact differences between different things.
    Trend analysis: Trend analysis involves looking at data over a period of time to see if a particular trend is forming.

Data Representation
     Illustrate(চিত্রিত করা) different ways that a data could be shown to stakeholders.
     Methods generally include the use of charts, matrixes, and different types of diagrams.
    Examples:
         Flowcharts
         Fishbone diagrams
         Histograms

Decision Making
 Have to make a decision on what to do with that data:
Methods:
     Voting: Voting is used by a group to determine whether to proceed, change, or reject something. Voting can be:
      majority wins, unanimity, where everyone agrees; or plurality, where a majority is not obtained but that decision is chosen.
     Multicriteria decision analysis: This is when you make a table (matrix) that lists different types of criteria, and then
      evaluate an idea based on those criteria.
     Autocratic(স্বৈরাচারী) decision making: This is when one person makes a decision for the entire team.





79. Interpersonal and Team Skills
     All project managers need to have good interpersonal and team skills in order to manage the different stakeholders 
      that will be on the project.
     most important tool in real-life project management.

Methods:
    Active listening: Active listening is understanding, acknowledging, and clarifying what others are saying to you.

    Conflict management: Anytime you bring a team together, bound to have conflicts on that team.

    Facilitation(সহজীকরণ): This can include bringing the group together, generating  ideas, solving problems, and dissipating the team.

    Meeting management: Meeting management generally includes having an agenda, inviting the right stakeholders, setting a time limit.





80. Meetings
     Meetings can be done face-to-face or virtually.
     Have an agenda and distribute it to all attendees before the meeting.
     Meetings must be timed, including having set start and finish times for topics and the entire meeting.
     Make sure that the meeting always stays on topic and does not go off topic.
     Ensure that all attendees have input to the topics.
     Distribute detailed meeting minutes once the meeting is complete.




81. PMIS: Project Management Information System (PMIS)
     Automated system that is used to help the project manager optimize the schedule or keep track of all the 
      documents and the deliverables.
     Usually the computer system that a given organization uses to manage its projects.
     It should include all the software and hardware tools that we need to manage
      the project from start to finish.
     Includes the work authorization system and the configuration management system.





82. Change Request
     Proposal to change a document, deliverable, or baseline.
     Can include a request to add or remove work from the scope, finish the project faster, or complete the project more cheaply.

Implements:
     Corrective action: is something that’s taken to ensure that the project gets back on track.
     Preventive action: is something you put in place to ensure the project stays on track.
     Defect repair is done to fix a broken component on a project, such as if network switch memory fails on a network upgrade project.




83. Work Performance Data, Info and report

Work Performance Data:
     Work performance data is simply raw data
     It is the status of the work that was done but does not have any analysis applied to it.
     It is not useful by itself.
     Usually outputs of executing processes

Work Performance Information:
     Information of the work that was performed compared to the plan.
     It gives you actual status about the deliverables.
     Work performance information is usually the output of most monitoring and controlling processes.

Work Performance Report:
     overall status report of the actual project.
     It takes all the work performance information and puts it together into one comprehensive(ব্যাপক) document.
     You take the work performance data and compare it against the plan to come up with the work performance information. 
    Then you take all the work performance information and create the work performance reports. 
    In short, data feeds info and all the info creates reports.




84. Updates
Updates (Project Management Plan, Project documents, EEF, OPA)
     Updates is a catchall term
     Updates can include project documents, the project management plan, OPA and EEF updates
     Expect to see this output many times throughout the book.

     How would the project affect them, either in a positive or negative way?
     Would they be active stakeholders, such as team members who work on the deliverable, or passive, 
      such as customers who watch the project work get done?
     What is their power authority, such as sponsors who will be paying for the project.





Planning
=====================================
87.Develop Project Management Plan

88.Plan Scope Management:
     Process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and product scope will be defined, 
    validated, and controlled.
     Guidance and direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project.

Scope Terms:
     Product Scope - features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.
     Project Scope - the work that is needed to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with .
      specified features and functions.
     Prevent Gold Plating, which is doing extra work not in the scope.
     Prevent Scope creep, which are unauthorized changes.

Plan Scope Management-Output:
     Scope Management Plan
     How the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled and verified
         Process for preparing & maintaining Scope Statement, WBS

    and controlling the project work.

-Define Activities - Outputs | **Activity List**
  - A complete list of all scheduled activities required to be performed on the project.
  - It should include a sufficient work description as well as an activity identifier. This is recommended so all stakeholders have a better understanding of all the work that needs to be performed on the project.
  - Work packages are scope-determined and deliverable-based.
  - Activities are focused on the work that needs to be executed within the work packages.
  - Schedule-focused, not WBS-focused.
  - Each activity should map back to one and only one work package (work package could have many activities).






94. Sequence Activities
    - Is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.
    - It defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project constraints.
    - Taking the activity list defined earlier and arranging the activities in the order they must be performed.

    - \(O\) = Optimistic Estimate
    - \(R\) = Realistic Estimate
    - \(P\) = Pessimistic Estimate

- **Standard Deviation**
  - \((P - O) / 6\)

- **Triangle Distribution**
  - The Triangle Distribution formula is \((O + R + P) / 3\)
    - \(O\) = Optimistic Estimate
    - \(R\) = Realistic Estimate
    - \(P\) = Pessimistic Estimate





97. Develop Schedule

- Analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints to create a schedule model for 
  project execution and monitoring and controlling.
- It generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities.
- Entering the activities, durations, and resources into the scheduling tool will generate a schedule with planned dates for 
  completing the project activities.

Develop Schedule - Tools:
### Schedule Network Analysis
- It employs several different techniques (Critical Path, Critical Chain, What-if analysis, and resource optimization techniques) 
  to determine the length of the schedule. 
  It is used to calculate the early start and early finish dates, and late start and late finish dates.

### Resource Optimization Techniques
- A method to flatten the schedule when resources are over-allocated or allocated unevenly. 
  Resource leveling can be applied in different methods to accomplish different goals. 
  One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are not overextended on activities.

### Data Analysis
  - What If Scenarios (Monte Carlo)**
  - Simulations

### Leads and Lags

### Schedule Compression
- **Crashing (Adding resources to a project activity)**
  - Always adds cost
  - May add additional risk
- **Fast Tracking (Activities performed in parallel)**
  - May not always add cost
  - May increase risk due to project rework

### PMIS
### Agile Release Planning
- The schedule will be broken up into smaller iterations, versus a traditional project where the schedule is 
for the entire product release. Smaller increments allow the customers an opportunity to give feedback on the product 
with a quicker turnaround.
- **Iteration Plan**
  - A plan that will be used to create a single iteration for part of the product.
- **Release Plan**
  - A set of iterations that will help to create a product that would be given to the customers for feedback.


### Develop Schedule - Outputs
- **Schedule data**
  - Schedule templates that the team used to calculate durations, assumptions, constraints, or resource requirements.

- **Project Calendars**
  - Identifies project shifts and work days.

     3 Types:
     Firm Fixed Price (FFP): This contract is when the price is fixed and cannot be changed.
     Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF): This contract is when the fixed price includes an additional fee for meeting a target set forth in the contract.
     Fixed Price Economic Price Adjustment (FP-EPA): This contract is used to adjust the fixed cost over the life of the contract because of economic conditions.

Cost-reimbursable
     When the buyer pays for the work expenses and then pays the seller a fee for their profit
     The risk is with the buyer because the cost overrun of work expenses is covered by the buyer
     3 Types:
     Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF): This contract is when the buyer pays the work expenses and then a fixed fee to the seller for profit.
     Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF): This contract is when the buyer pays the work expenses and an additional fee if a target is met, such as finishing two weeks earlier.
     Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF): This contract is when the buyer pays the work expenses and pays an award fee


Time and Material

Section 9: Agile Project Management Methods and Delivery | 9AgileSlides.pdf
=============================================
What is Agile:
    Developed for Software projects, but it is a methodology that can be used on all Projects types.
    Agile is an umbrella term that is used to refer to different types of iterative development.
    Scrum is the most common method of agile, there are others such as extreme programming (XP), lean development, and Kanban.



160. Agile vs. Traditional PM
    • Agile builds in increments vs. as a whole.
    • Agile does planning throughout vs. done all at once.
    • Agile delivers products over time vs. all at once.
    • Customers sees value faster vs. at the end.
    • Agile wants changes vs. discouraging changes.



161. Agile Benefits
• Customer involved throughout the life cycle.
• Greater Customer Interaction with all stakeholders.
• Constant Feedback is required to stay current and successful.
• Greater Value up front.
• Change is welcomed by all stakeholders.


Agile Concurrent Development
    • Fund incrementally – opt to extend, redirect, or cancel at a very granular level.
    • Deliver & realize value steadily.
    • Validate designs with users & customers.
    • Continuously adapt to risk and change.
    • Integrate early & often.

Agile Mindset
• Welcoming change.
• Working in small value increments.
• Using build and feedback loops.
• Learning through discovery.
• Value-driven development.
• Failing fast with learning.
• Continuous delivery.
• Continuous improvement.

163. Agile Manifesto
Create in 2001, Contains:
    ම 4 values
    ම 12 guiding principles
    https://agilemanifesto.org/



164. Agile Manifesto Four (4) Values

    Individuals & interactions              over        Processes & tools
    Working software                        over        Comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration                  over        Contract negotiation
    Responding to change                    over        Following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
• While processes and tools will likely be necessary on our projects, we should focus the team's attention on the 
    individuals and interactions involved.
• Projects are undertaken by people, not tools.
• Problems get solved by people, not processes.
• Projects are ultimately about people.


Working software over comprehensive documentation
• Focus on delivering value vs. paperwork.
• Agile documents should be barely sufficient.
• Done just in time.
• Done just because.
• Delivering software that does what it should comes first, before creating documentation.
• Agile dramatically simplifies the administrative paperwork relating to time, cost, and scope control.


Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
• Be flexible and accommodating, instead of fixed and uncooperative.
• Manage change, don’t suppress change.
• Shared definition of “done”.
• Requires trusting relationship.


Responding to change over following a plan
• Spend effort and energy responding to changes.
• Software projects tend to have high rates of change.





169. Agile Guiding 12 Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
   Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers)and users should be 
   able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity; the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.



170. Agile Methods
    • Over 12 agile methodologies
    • Scrum
    • Extreme Programming (XP)
    • Kanban Development
    • Lean Software Development

Agile Terms:
• Product Owner - Designated person that represents the customer on the project.
• Agile Project Manager/Scrum Master – Manages the agile project.
• Product Backlog - Project requirements from the stakeholders.
• Sprint Planning Meeting - Meeting done by the agile team to determine what features will be done in the next sprint.
• Sprint Backlog – Work the team selects to get done in the next sprint.
• Sprint - A short iteration where the project teams work to complete the work in the sprint backlog, (1-4 weeks typical).
• Daily Stand Up Meeting - A quick meeting each day to discuss project statuses, led by the Scrum Master. Usually 15 minutes.
• Sprint Review – An inspection done at the end of the sprint by the customers.
• Retrospective – Meeting done to determine what went wrong during the sprint and what went right. Lessons learned for the sprint.
• Partial Completed Product - Customers demo the product and provide feedback. This feedback adjusts the next sprint priorities.
• Release - Several sprints' worth of work directed to operations for possible rollout and testing.
• Sprint = Iteration.

    1. Sprint planning meeting
    2. Sprints
       • Daily stand-up meeting
    3. Sprint review meeting
    4. Sprint retrospectives.


Sprint Planning Meeting
• Used to determine what work will be done in that sprint and how the work will be achieved.
• The development team predicts what can be delivered based on estimates, projected capacity, 
  and past performance to define the sprint goal.
• The development team then determines how this functionality will be built and how the team will organize to deliver the sprint goal.
• Output of this will be the sprint backlog. The work to get done in the next sprint.

Sprints:
• A sprint is a timeboxed (time-limited) iteration of 1-4 weeks to build a potentially releasable product.
• Each sprint includes a sprint planning meeting, daily Scrum, the actual work, a sprint review meeting, and the sprint retrospective.
• During the sprint, no changes are made that would affect the sprint.
• The development team members are kept the same throughout the sprint.

Daily Scrum (or Standup):
• A 15-minute time-boxed activity for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
• Should be held at the same time and place each day.
• Each team member should answer 3 questions:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Are there any impediments(প্রতিবন্ধকতা) in your way?

Sprint Review:
• Takes place at the end of the Sprint.
• Designed to gather feedback from stakeholders on what the Team has completed in the sprint.
• Team demonstrates work that was completed during the sprint.
• To create a conversation between the Team and the stakeholders about how to make the product better.
• Should be time boxed to no more than an hour per week of Sprint.


Sprint Retrospective:
• Opportunity for the Team to inspect and create a plan for improvements to be done during the next Sprint.
• Team discusses:
  • What went well
  • What went wrong
  • What to do more of
  • What to do less of




174. Scrum Artifacts
• Product Increment
    Part of the product that is complete after each sprint.
• Product Backlog
    Prioritized list of valuable items to deliver.
• Sprint Backlog
    List of committed items to be addressed within Sprint.

Product Backlog
• Prioritized list of all work that needs to be done to complete the product.
• List is dynamic, it evolves as more work is added and prioritized.
• Items in it are prioritized by the product owner and sorted by value.
• Most valuable items are listed first.
• Constantly being refined as more work is added to it.
• Team and product owner will “groom the backlog”.

Product Increment:
• Part of the product that is done after each sprint.
• Done to get feedback after each sprint.
• The product owner and team need to agree upon the “definition of done” before the team starts working on the product.

Sprint Backlog:
• The sprint backlog is the set of items from the product backlog that were selected for a specific sprint.
• The sprint backlog is accompanied by a plan of how to achieve the sprint goal, 
  so it serves as the development team's forecast for the functionality that will be part of the sprint.
• It is a highly visible view of the work being undertaken and may only be updated by the development team.

Definition of Done (DoD)
• Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding of what it means when work is considered done, 
  it should be defined at the beginning of the project, and it applies globally to the project.
• Definition of Done (DoD) is a crucial element of a successful scrum software development.
• Might include things such as:
  • DoD for unit & functional tests.
  • DoD Documentation.
  • DoD for writing code.




175. Extreme Programming (XP)
    Software development centric agile method
    Focus software development good practices
    Scrum at the project management level focuses on prioritizing work and getting feedback

XP Core Values:
Simplicity
• Reduce complexity, extra features, and waste.
• "Find the simplest thing that could possibly work."

Communication:
• Team members know what is expected of them and what other people are working on.
• Daily stand-up meeting is a key communication component.

Feedback:
• Get impressions of correctness early.
• Failing fast allows for faster improvement.

Courage:
• Allow our work to be entirely visible to others.

Respect
• People work together as a team and everyone is accountable for the success or failure of the project.
• Recognize people work differently and respect those differences.






176. XP Roles:
Coach
• Acts as a mentor, guiding the process and helping the team stay on track. Is a facilitator helping the team become effective.

Customer:
• Business representative who provides the requirements, priorities, and drives the business direction for the project.

Programmers
• Developers who build the product. Writes the codes.

Testers
• Help the customer define and write the acceptance tests for the user stories.

Product Owner and Customer are equivalent
ScrumMaster and Coach are equivalent





177. XP Practices: Planning Activities (Games):

Release Planning:
• Push of new functionality all the way to the production user.
• Customer outlines the functionality required.
• Developers estimate difficulty of build.

Iteration Planning:
• Short development cycles within a release (Scrum calls "sprints").
• Conducted at start of every iteration, or every two weeks.
• Customer explains functionality they would like in iteration.
• Developers break functionality into tasks and estimate work.
• Based on estimates and amount of work accomplished in previous iteration.

Small Releases:
• Frequent, small releases to test environments.
• Demonstrate progress and increase visibility for the customer.
• Quality is maintained: Rigorous testing or Continuous integration.

Customer Tests:
• Customer describes one or more tests to show software is working.
• Team builds automated tests to prove software is working.

Collective Code Ownership:
• Any pair of developers can improve or amend any code.
• Multiple people work on all code, which results in increased visibility and knowledge of code base.
• Leads to a higher level of quality; with more people looking at the code, there is a greater chance defects will be discovered.
• Less risk if programmer leaves, since knowledge is shared.







178. Basic Terminology review:






179. Lean Development:

Lean was started by Toyota as a manufacturing method that was applied to software development.

Principles:
• Using visual management tools
• Identifying customer-defined value
• Building in learning and continuous improvement

Eliminate waste:
• To maximize value, we must minimize waste. For software systems, waste can take the form of partially done work, delays, handoffs, unnecessary features.

Empower the team:
• Rather than taking a micro-management approach, we should respect team members' superior knowledge of the technical steps required on the project and let them.

Deliver fast:
• Quickly delivering valuable software and iterating through designs.

Optimize the whole:
• We aim to see the system as more than the sum of its parts.

Build quality in:
• Build quality into the product and continually assure quality throughout the development process.

Defer decisions:
• Balance early planning with making decisions and committing to things as late as possible.

Amplify learning:
• This concept involves facilitating communication early and often, getting feedback as soon as possible, and building on what we learn.

Seven Wastes of Lean:
1. Partially done work
2. Extra Processes
3. Extra features
4. Task switching
5. Waiting
6. Motion
7. Defects






180. Kanban Development

Kanban development is derived from the lean production system used at Toyota. "Kanban" is a Japanese word meaning "signboard."

Kanban five core principles:
Visualize the workflow:
• Software projects, by definition, manipulate knowledge, which is intangible and invisible.

Limit WIP:
• Keeping the amount of work in progress low increases the visibility of issues and bottlenecks.

Manage flow:
• By tracking the flow of work through a system, issues can be identified and changes can be measured for effectiveness.

Make process policies explicit:
• It is important to clearly explain how things work so the team can have open discussions about improvements.

Improve collaboration:
• Through scientific measurement and experimentation, the team should collectively own and improve the processes it uses.






181. Other agile methods
    Feature-Driven Development
    • Team will first develop an overall model for the product then build a list, and plan the work.

    Dynamic Systems Development
    • One of the first agile methods and follows eight principles.

    Crystal
    • It’s a customized methodologies that are coded by color names.






182. Agile declaration of Interdependence
183. Agile mindset


184. Leading Effectively
Tap into people’s intrinsic motivations
• Discover why team members want to do something and what motivates them, then align that with the project goals.

Management vs Leadership
• Management Æ Mechanical Focus
• Leadership Æ Humanistic Focus (on people and purpose)

Servant Leadership: Leader provides what the team needs:
  1. Shield team from interruptions
  2. Remove impediments to progress
  3. (Re)Communicate project vision
  4. Carry food and water

Twelve Principles for Leading Agile Projects:
    1. Learn the team members' needs
    2. Learn the project requirements
    3. Act for the simultaneous welfare of the team and the project
    4. Create an environment of functional accountability
    5. Have a vision of the completed project
    6. Use the project vision to drive your own behavior
    7. Serve as the central figure in successful project team development
    8. Recognize team conflict as a positive step
    9. Manage with an eye toward ethics
    10. Remember that ethics is not an afterthought, but an integral part of our thinking
    11. Take time to reflect on the project
    12. Develop the habit of thinking backwards

Leadership Tools and Techniques:
• Using these tools still needs a soft-skills approach
• Modeling Desired Behavior:
  • Honesty
  • Forward-Looking
  • Competent
  • Inspiring
  • Communicating project vision
  • Enabling others to act
• Switch from exclusive tools to inclusive tools
• Being willing to change the status quo

Leadership Tasks:
• Practice Transparency through Visualization
• Create a safe environment for experimentation
• Experiment with new techniques and processes
• Share knowledge through collaboration
• Encourage emergent leadership via a safe environment






185. Value-Driven Delivery
Projects undertaken to generate business value:
• Produce Benefit
• Improve Service
• Market Demand
• Safety Compliance
• Regulatory Compliance




186. Early Value Delivery
Agile promotes early and often delivery:
• Aim to deliver highest value early in project.
• Deliver as many high-value components as soon as possible.
• Reduces risk.
• Stakeholder satisfaction leads to project success.
• Shows understanding of stakeholders’ needs.
• Stakeholders are engaged.
• Builds confidence of stakeholders in team.





187. Reduce Waste
Minimize Waste, e.g.:
• Partially done work
• Extra processes
• Extra features
• Waiting
• Defects





188. Assessing Value - Financial metrics
Return on investment (ROI)
• The ratio of the benefits received from an investment to the money invested. Usually a percentage.

Internal rate of return (IRR)
• Interest rate you will need to get in today’s money to receive a certain amount of money in the future.

Present Value/Net Present value (NPV)
• Value of future money in today’s terms.

Earned Value Management
• Formulas that monitor the value of the project as it's progressing.





189. Accounting on agile projects:
    Refers to how the different economic models of agile work.
    Agile accounting is different than traditional accounting.
    Agile looks to deliver value as quickly as possible.
    Uses minimal viable product (MVP).
    This leads to more opportunity for incremental funding.






190. Key Performance Indicators
Uses as a way to measure the project progress:
• Rate of progress: How many points have been completed.
• Remaining work: How much work is yet to be done from the backlog.
• Likely completion date.
• Likely cost remaining.




191. Regulatory Compliance
Mandated requirements usually by government agencies:
• Must be implemented into the project work as regular development work.
• Doing it after the project work is done.


192. Risk Management
Risk is closely related to value:
• Considered as anti-value.
• Usually has the potential to remove, erode, or reduce value with threats.


Tools to Manage Risk:
    Risk-adjusted backlog
    Risk burndown chart





193. How Customers Conduct Value Prioritization
Valued-based prioritization is one of the core practices in agile planning.
Features are prioritized on the basis of business value, risk, and dependencies.
Some prioritization techniques used include:
• Simple Scheme
• MoSCoW prioritization
• Monopoly Money
• 100-point method
• Dot Voting or Multi-voting
• Kano Analysis
• Requirements Prioritization Model





194. Different Prioritization Techniques

Simple Scheme
• Priority 1, Priority 2, Priority 3, etc.
• Could be problematic as many items might become the first priority.

MoSCoW prioritization
• Must have
• Should have
• Could have
• Would like to have, but not this time

Dot Voting or Multi-voting
• Each person gets a certain number of dots to distribute to the requirements.

Monopoly Money
• Give everyone equal monopoly money.
• They then distribute the funds to what they value the most.

100-point method
• Each person is given 100 points.
• They then use those points to distribute to individual requirements.





195. Kano Analysis
Kano Analysis
ම Helps to understand the customer satisfaction
ම Delighters/Exciters
ම Satisfiers
ම Dissatisfiers
ම Indifferent

https://foldingburritos.com/kano-model/

Prioritization / Ranking is Relative:
    Doesn’t matter what techniques the customers uses priority, the end results should be a list of prioritized features.





196. Delivering Value Incrementally
    Incremental delivery is about deploying working parts of a product over the life of the project.
    In software development, it's first delivered to a testing environment then to production.
    This will reduce the amount of rework by discovering issues early and fixing them.



197. Minimal Viable Product
Refers to a set of functionality that is complete enough to be useful, but small enough not to be an entire project.
Usually a module in a software.




198. Tools for Agile Projects
Low-tech, high-touch over computer models:

When using computer models, problems could arise such as:
    • Data accuracy perception increases.
    • No stakeholder interaction. Only a few people would update them.

Low-Tech, High-Touch Tools:
    Use cards, charts, whiteboards, and walls.
    Promotes communication and collaboration.
    Skip using a computer Gantt chart to a Kanban board.

Kanban/Task Board:
    An "information radiator" - ensures efficient diffusion of information.
    Can be drawn on a whiteboard or even a section of wall.
    Makes iteration backlog visible.
    Serves as a focal point for the daily meeting.






199. Limit WIP
    Includes work that has been started but not completed yet.
    Represents money spent with no return.
    Hides process bottlenecks that slow the processes.
    Represents risk in the form of potential risk.
    Agile processes aim to limit and optimize WIP.
    Optimal WIP makes processes efficient.


200. Cumulative Flow Diagrams


201. Agile Contracting

Agile's flexibility creates difficulty in outlining contract acceptance criteria.
• Agile attempts to fix resources and time (cost) and vary functionality.
• "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation":
  - Close cooperation
  - Active participation
  - Timely and often feedback
Money for nothing and change for free.

Graduated Fixed Price Contract:
• Buyer/Seller share in risks and rewards.
• Different hourly rates based on:
  - Finish early, Finish on time, Finish late.

Fixed Price Work Packages:
• Mitigate risks of under/overestimating.




202. Verifying and Validating
“Gulf of Evaluation”
ම What one person describes is often different from how another interprets

Frequent Verification and Validation:
    Resolve problems as soon as possible
    Don’t let little problems grow over time

Section 10: Agile Stakeholder Management
=============================================
203. Stakeholder Stewardship
    Looking after everyone involved on the project.
    Ensuring everyone has everything they need to compete the project successfully.
    Starts with identifying the stakeholders.



204. Educating People about agile
Teach all the stakeholders about the benefits of agile.
    Concerns about agile can include:
        • Senior management and sponsors: They are worried about the risk of failing.
        • Managers: Fear the loss of control.
        • Project team: Resist agile methods.
        • Users: Concerned they will not get all features.





205. Engaging Stakeholders
Short iterations and releases keep them engaged.
Keeping them engaged can lead to stakeholders being more involved and requesting more changes.
This helps identify risks and issues early.
If some stakeholders cause problems, the agile PM will need to use interpersonal skills to resolve issues.
Need to have a process for escalating stakeholder issues.

Why such a big focus on stakeholders?
• Projects are done by people for people.





206. Methods of Stakeholder Engagement
    • Get the right stakeholders.
    • Cement stakeholder involvement.
    • Actively manage stakeholder interest.
    • Frequently discuss what "done" looks like.
    • Show progress and capabilities.
    • Candidly discuss estimates and projections.

• Important to ensure customers and agile project team have the same vision.
• Methods include:
  • Agile Charter
  • Definition of “Done”
  • Agile Modeling
  • Use case diagram
  • Data models
  • Screen design
  • Wireframes
  • Personas






207. Agile Chartering
• High-level (uses the W5H)
• Agreement
• Authority to proceed
• Focuses on how project will be conducted
  • Allows for flexibility and ability to deal with change
• Project-specific processes outlined
• May use project Tweet – Describes project goal in 140 characters or less.





208. Definition of Done




209. Set a shared vision
Creating a shared vision of what done looks like
Should be done for:
    ම User stories
    ම Releases
    ම Final project deliverables


210. Agile Modeling

• Different modeling techniques that are used to help establish the shared vision
• Should be lightweight or “barely sufficient”

• Use case diagrams
  • Visually shows how users would use an application

• Data models
  • How the data are structured in tables and their relationships

• Screen designs
  • Simple screen shots

• Wireframes
  • Quick mock-up of product
  • “Low-fidelity prototyping”
  • Clarify what “done” looks like
  • Validate approach prior to execution





211. Personas
  • Quick guides or reminders of key stakeholders and interests
  • Provide description of users
  • Be grounded in reality
  • Be goal-oriented, specific, and relevant
  • Be tangible and actionable
  • Generate focus
  • Help team focus on valuable features to users




212. Communicating with stakeholders
    Face to face communication
    Two-way communication
    Knowledge sharing
    Information Radiators
    Social Media

• Two-way communication:
  • Just don’t ask for confirmation or concerns, but actually listen to what they have to say
• Knowledge sharing
  • Agile teams work closely with each other such as with pair-programming
  • Using Kanban boards or wireframes are ways to share information
  • Use of low-tech tools like a whiteboard will allow all to see the work and understand it
  • We must encourage it
• Information Radiators
  • Things that are highly visible
  • Used to display information
  • Usually includes charts, graphs, and boards
• Social Media
  • Used to communicate
  • Can include Twitter or Instagram






213. Green Zone and Red Zone

• Red Zone:
  • Blames others for everything
  • Responds defensively
  • Feels threatened
  • Triggers defensiveness
  • Doesn’t let go or forgive
  • Uses shame and blame
  • Focuses on short-term advantage
  • Doesn’t seek or value feedback
  • Sees conflict as a battle and only seeks to win
  • Communicates high level of disapproval
  • Sees others as the problem or enemy
  • Does not listen effectively

• Green Zone:
  • Takes responsibility
  • Seeks to respond non-defensively
  • Is not easily threatened psychologically
  • Attempts to build success
  • Uses persuasion rather than force
  • Thinks both short and long term
  • Welcomes feedback
  • Sees conflict as a natural part of life
  • Seeks excellence rather than victory
  • Listens well




214. How to conduct a workshop

• Meeting when work gets done
• Retrospectives are a type of workshop
• Ways to make them more effective:
  • Diverse groups have a larger perspective
  • Use methods such as round-robin to ensure no one dominates
  • Try to get everyone to participate in the first few minutes
• User story workshops are where we write the user stories and keep stakeholders engaged





215. Brainstorming

• Brainstorming:
  • Quiet Writing
    • Give people about 5 minutes to write down their ideas
  • Round-Robin
    • Pass a token around to ensure everyone will speak
  • Free-for-all
    • People shout out their thoughts; may only work in a supportive environment




216. Collaboration Games
    Remember the future
    Prune the product tree
    Speedboat(Sailboat)

• Remember the Future
  • Ask stakeholders to imagine an upcoming release was successful and to look back
  • Gets a better understanding of how a stakeholder would define success
  • Outlines how we can accomplish that success for them

• Prune the Product Tree
  • Draw a tree and ask stakeholders to add their features to it
  • Use sticky notes to have them place new features on the tree
  • Group the features on the trunk
  • Features that depend on other features would be higher up the tree
  • Lets everyone understand the priorities of development

• Speedboat (Sailboat)
  • Draw a waterline and a boat moving
  • Explain the boat is moving toward the goals of the project
  • Ask them to use sticky notes to show what can make the boat move (wind) and what can stop it (anchors)
  • Allows stakeholders to identify threats and opportunities




217. Using Critical Soft Skills
    Emotional intelligence
    Negotiation
    Active Listening
    Facilitation
    Conflict Resolution
    Participatory Decision Models




218. Emotional Intelligence
  • Our skill to identify, assess, and influence the emotions of ourselves and others around us
  • We need to recognize our own feelings
  • Then we can learn how to respond to others and how they feel
  • Understand how we take care of ourselves will impact others around us
  • As an agile PM, we have to know when team members are stuck, angry, or frustrated





219. Negotiation
    • This happens all throughout the project
    • Good negotiation will allow everyone to investigate the options and trade-offs
    • Most effective when interactions between people are positive and there is room for give and take



220. Active Listening

  • Level 1: Internal – how it is going to affect me
  • Level 2: Focused – put ourselves in the mind of the speaker
  • Level 3: Global – builds on level with body language



221. Facilitation
  • Run effective meetings and workshops.
  • Have the following:
    • Goals
    • Rules
    • Timing
    • Assisting




222. Conflict Resolution
• All projects will have conflicts
  • While some level of conflicts is good, we need to ensure they don’t become a “world war” where people are trying to 
    destroy each other.
  • Levels of conflict (1-5):
    • Level 1: Problem to solve – sharing info
    • Level 2: Disagreement – Personal protection
    • Level 3: Contest – Must win
    • Level 4: Crusade – Protecting one’s group
    • Level 5: World War – Must destroy the other






223. Participatory Decision Models
• Engage stakeholders in the decision-making process
  • Simple voting
  • Vote “for” or “against” it
  • Thumbs up/down/sideways
    • Thumbs up: Support
    • Thumbs down: Against
    • Sideways: Undecided
  • Fist of five
    • 1 finger: Total support
    • 5 fingers: Strongly against it





Team Performance
------------------------------------------

224. People Over Processes
• Projects are done by people, not tools
  • Agile manifesto: “Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools”
  • Focus on the people side of the project
  • Projects are more about people management than tools management

• COCOMO
  • Constructive Cost Model
  • Used to determine correlation between project input variables and final cost to estimate future projects
  • People factors have a score of 33, which is 11 times more significant than tools and processes




225. Development Team roles
    Self-Organizing
    Self-Directing
    Small teams with fewer than 12 members


Generalizing Specialists:
    Have members that can do different tasks
    Members skilled in more than one area
    Share work reduce bottleneck


226. Building Agile teams

High-Performance Agile Teams:
    Have a shared vision
    Realist goals
    Fewer than 12 members
    Have a sense of team identity
    Provide strong leadership


227. Safe place
Experiments (Have a safe place)
ම Establish safe environment for disagreement
ම Allows team members to build strong commitment to decisions
ම Encourage people to experiments with new methods
ම Leads to more engagement

• Welcome Constructive Disagreement
• Leads to better buy-in and decisions
• Avoiding conflicts can lead to conflicts escalating
• A safe place for disagreement leads to successful problem solving



228. Models of team development

• Shu-Ha-Ri Model of Skill Mastery
  • Shu - Obey,
  • Ha – Moving away,
  • Ri – finding individual paths

• Dreyfus Model of Adult Skill Acquisition
  • Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert



229. Tuckman Five stages of team development

• Tuckman’s Five Stages of Team Development
  1. Forming: team comes together and starts to get to know each other. There is not much conflict or communication.
  2. Storming: team members start to have conflicts with each other. They start to learn of each other’s ideas and may not agree with them. Most conflicts take place in this stage.
  3. Norming: the team members begin to agree with each other on the best methods to build the deliverables. Generally, everyone is coming to a consensus.
  4. Performing: the team is performing well and is working without conflict.
  5. Adjourning: In this stage, the project is completed and the team is reassigned.

• Adaptive Leadership
  • Concept of adapting how we lead team based on specific circumstances and how mature team is in formation





230. Training, coaching, and mentoring

• Training
  • Teaching of skills or knowledge

• Coaching
  • Process that helps a person develop and improve their skills

• Mentoring
  • More of a professional relationship that can fix issues on an as-needed basis
  • Helps team stay on track, overcome issues, and continually improve skills
  • Individual level
  • Whole-team level




231. Team Spaces

Co-located Teams
• All team members work together in the same location
• Allows for face-to-face time and interaction
• Should be within 33 feet of each other
• No physical barriers
• Sometimes a virtual co-location

Lots of low-tech, high-touch
• Whiteboards and task boards
• Sticky notes, flip charts
• Round table discussions
• No barriers to face-to-face communication

Caves and Commons
• Caves: spaces where team members can retreat to work individually
• Commons: spaces where team members can work as a group

Osmotic Communication
• Information flows that occur as part of everyday conversations and questions
• Ideally within 33 feet or 10 meters

Global and Cultural Diversity
• Challenges include time zones, cultures, native languages, and communication styles

Distributed Teams
• At least one team member works off-site
• Need to replicate co-location team benefits
• Agile Tools:
  • Low-Tech, High-Touch Tools
  • Digital Tools for distributed teams
  • Video conferencing
  • Interactive whiteboards
  • IM / VoIP
  • Virtual card walls
  • Webcams
  • Digital cameras

Tracking Team Performance
• Burn Charts:
  • Burnup
  • Burndown
• Velocity Charts




232. Burn and Velocity charts

Velocity Charts:

Example Calculation:
If a team completes 3 iterations with an average velocity of 18 points per iteration, 
how many iterations would it take to complete 250 points of work?

Calculation:
250 / 18 ≈ 14 iterations

Section 11: Agile Planning, Problem Resolution and Continuous Improvement
=============================================
233. What is adaptive planning
    • Planning is an ongoing process
    • Multiple mechanisms to proactively update the plan
    • Focus on value delivery and minimize non-value-adding work
    • Uncertainty drives the need to replan
    • Frequently discover issues and experience high rates of change




234. Agile Plans
Agile planning varies from traditional planning
• Trial and demonstration uncover true requirements, which then require replanning
• Agile planning is less of an upfront effort, and instead is done more throughout the project
• Midcourse adjustments are the norm

Principles of Agile Planning
1. Plan at multiple levels
2. Engage the team and the customer in planning
3. Manage expectations by frequently demonstrating progress
4. Tailor processes to the project’s characteristics
5. Update the plan based on the project priorities
6. Ensure encompassing estimates that account for risk, distractions, and team availability
7. Use appropriate estimate ranges to reflect the level of uncertainty in the estimate
8. Base projections on completion rates
9. Factor in diversion and outside work






235. Progressive Elaboration
Adding more detail as information emerges
Includes:
• Plans
• Estimates
• Designs
• Test scenarios

Rolling wave planning: Planning at multiple points in time as data becomes available





236. Value Decomposition(পচন) and Design the product box
Assessing and prioritizing the business value of work items, and then plan accordingly.
Consider payback frequency and dependencies.

Value-Based Decomposition:
• Breaks down requirements and prioritizes them.
• Design the product box.





237. Coarse(মোটা) Requirements
Keep requirements "coarse" then progressively refine them.
Helps keep the overall design balanced.
Delays decision on implementation until the "last responsible moment."






238. Timeboxing
Short, fixed-duration periods of time in which activities or work are undertaken:
- If work is not completed within the time period, move it to another timebox.
- Daily Stand-up – 15 minutes
- Retrospectives – 2 hours
- Sprints – 1-4 weeks

Beware of Parkinson’s Law:
- Work tends to expand to fill the time given.






239. Agile Estimation
Knowledge of agile estimation theory & ability to perform simple agile estimating techniques:

Why do we estimate?
- Determining which pieces of work can be done within a release or iteration.

How are estimates created?
- By progressing through the stages of planning.

How should estimates be stated?
- Should be stated in ranges.

When do we estimate?
- Throughout the project, with more detail in the later parts of the project.

Who estimates?
- Team members will do their own estimates.





240. Ideal Time
Refers to the time it would take to complete a given task assuming zero interruptions or unplanned problems.





241. User Stories
User Stories / Backlogs:
- Business functionality within a feature that involves 1-3 days of work.
- Acts as agreement between customers and development team.
- Every requirement is a user story.
- Every story, including technical stories, has value.
- Common structure of a user story.

User Story Example:
- "As a payroll clerk, I want to be able to view a report of all payroll taxes, so that I can pay them on time."
- "As a sales person, I want to be able to see a current list of leads, so that I can call them back quickly."
- "As a student of this course, I want to be able to understand the requirements of the exam, so that 
   I know if I qualify for it or not."

Three C’s of Stories:
- Have users write the stories on index cards.
- No details, it’s used to help converse.
- 3 Cs:
  - Card
  - Conversation
  - Confirmation

User Stories - INVEST:
- Effective user stories should be “INVEST”:
  - Independent: Should be independent so it can be reprioritized.
  - Negotiable: Should allow for trade-offs based on cost and function.
  - Valuable: Should clearly state the value of it.
  - Estimatable: Should be able to estimate how long it will take to complete.
  - Small: Stories should be between 4-40 hours of work.
  - Testable: Should be testable to ensure it will be accepted once completed.





242. User Story Backlog
    Prioritize Requirements:
    - Refining (Grooming) Backlog: Keeping the backlog updated and accurately prioritized.



243. Assigning points to the stories using Fibonacci Sequence
Relative Sizing and Story Points:
- Absolute estimates are difficult for humans to make.
- Estimates should be relative.
- Assign points to each story using relative numbers.




244. Story Points and T-Shirt Sizing
Affinity Estimating:
- Group estimates into categories or collections.

T-Shirt Sizing:
- Place stories in sizes of t-shirts.




245. Wideband Delphi
- Group-based estimation approach.
- Panel of experts, anonymously.

It’s used to prevent:
- Bandwagon effect.
- HIPPO decision making (HIghest-Paid Person's Opinion).
- Groupthink.




246. Using Planning Poker to assign story points
    Advantages of Wideband Delphi
    Fast, collaborative process
    Uses cards with Fibonacci sequence





247. Story Maps and Product Roadmaps
High-level planning tool:
- Stakeholders map out project priorities early in planning.
- Serves as the "product roadmap".
- Shows when features will be delivered and what is included in each release.
Can convert the story map into a product roadmap.




248. Iterations and Spikes
Types of Iterations:
- Iteration 0:
  - Set the stage for development efforts.
  - Doesn’t build anything.

- Development Iteration:
  - Build the product increment.

- Iteration H (hardening sprint or release):
  - Done at the end to clean up code or produce documentation.


ම Architectural spike
ම Period of time dedicated to proof of concept
ම Risk-Based Spike
ම Team investigate to reduce or eliminate risk




249. Iteration and Release Planning

- Iteration Planning:
  - Meeting run by the delivery team.
  - Discuss the user stories in the backlog.
  - Select the user stories for the iteration.
  - Define the acceptance criteria.
  - Break down the user stories into tasks.
  - Estimate the tasks.

- Release Planning:
  - Meeting with all stakeholders to determine which stories will be done in which iterations for the upcoming release.
  - Selecting the user stories for the release.
  - Using Velocity – points per iteration.
  - Slicing the stories:
    - Breaking down stories that are too large to be completed in 1 iteration.



Problem Detection and Resolution
250. Understand how problems happens
- All projects will have problems.
- As a project progresses, the agile PM should expect issues to happen.
- Over time, issues can delay or change project objectives.




251. Technical Debt
    - Backlog of work caused by not doing regular cleanup.
    - If not done, it will lead to increased costs of development and make it harder to implement changes.
    - Refactoring is the solution.



252. Success and Failure Modes
Why do people Fail:
1. Making mistakes
2. Preferring to fail conservatively
3. Inventing rather than researching
4. Being creatures of habit
5. Being inconsistent

Why do we succeed:
1. Being good at looking around
2. Being able to learn
3. Being malleable
4. Taking pride in work

Success Strategies:
- Balance discipline with tolerance
- Start with something concrete and tangible
- Copy and alter
- Watch and listen
- Support both concentration and communication
- Match work assignment with the person
- Retain the best talent
- Use rewards that preserve joy and combine rewards
- Get feedback





253. Lead time and Cycle time

Lead/Cycle time:
• Lead time: how long something takes to go through the entire process
• Cycle time: how long something takes to go through a part of the process. Part of lead time.

Cycle Time:
• Measure of how long it takes to get things done
• Closely related to work in progress (WIP)
• Excessive WIP is associated with several problems
• Represents money invested with no return on investment yet
• Hides bottlenecks in processes & masks efficiency issues
• Represents risk in form of potential rework

Cycle Time:
• Long cycle times lead to increased amounts of WIP
• Throughput: Amount of work that can done in a time period

Cycle Time Question:
What would be the cycle time of feature A, if it requires 60 points of work and the team can complete 5 points per day?
=60/5 points per day = 12 days.





254. Defects
    Longer defects are left, more expensive to fix
    More work may have been built on top of bad design, resulting in more work to be undone
    Later in development cycle, more stakeholders impacted by defect and more expensive to fix

Escaped Defects:
• Defects that make it to the customer





255. Variances(ভিন্নতা) and Control Limits
    Variance:
    • Measure of how far apart things are (or vary)

    Trend Analysis:
    • Measure that provides insight into future issues

    Lagging Metrics:
    • Provides information on something that has already happened

    Leading Metrics:
    • Provides information on what is or is about to occur

    Control Limits:
    • Help diagnose issues before they occur
    • Provide guidelines to operate within



256. Risk Management
Risk Adjusted Backlog:
• Adjusting the backlog for risk
• Done after risk response

Expected Monetary Value (EMV):
• EMV = Impact($) x Probability(%)

Risk Severity:
• Risk Severity = Risk Probability x Risk Impact
• Uses a scale of numbers (e.g., 1-5)




257. Fixing Problems
    Problem Solving as continuous improvement
    Engage the team
    Some problems can’t be solved


Why Engaging the Team?
▶ Team usually produces the best practical solutions

Benefits:
    ▶ Get consensus from all members

▶ Change things for good reason, not just for the sake of change
▶ Develop a hybrid





260. Value Stream Maps
    Optimize the flow of information or materials to complete a process
    ▶ Reduce waste (waiting times) or unnecessary work

Steps to creating:
▶ Identify the product or service
▶ Create a value stream map
▶ Review to find waste
▶ Create a new map with the desired improvement
▶ Develop a roadmap to implement the fixes
▶ Plan to revisit it again





261. Project Pre-Mortems:
    Team meeting that looks at possible things that can cause failure during a project before they take place
Steps include:
▶ Think what the failures might be
▶ Create a list of reasons that can cause the failures
▶ Review the project plan to determine what can be done to reduce or remove the reasons for failure





262. Retrospective Intro
About 2 Hours for a typical retrospective:
    Set Stage – 6 Minutes
    Gather Data – 40 Minutes
    Generate Insights – 25 Minutes
    Decide What to Do – 20 Minutes

Section 16: PM Mindset  | 16MindsetSlides.pdf
=============================================

Traditional:

327. Traditional Mindset Part 1
     Identification and analysis of stakeholders is something that is done throughout the project not just at the beginning.
     Always follow a plan and never allow changes to the plan without an approved change request.
     Any stakeholder that wants to change any component of the project management plan will need to submit a change request.
     All change requests will need to be reviewed and assessed.
     Never take actions without first creating a plan.
     Consult with the project team before making decisions, as they will have a more practical approach.




328. Traditional Mindset Part 2
     Your final decision should always benefit the objectives of the project.
     For example, if there are conflicting methods on how to complete a particular task, then choose the method 
      that would deliver the most value to the project outcome.
     Try to use tools that are inclusive such as a whiteboard with a marker versus complex software.
     All scope changes should be assessed on how it will impact all other parts of the project including 
      schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholders engagement.
     When conducting estimating uses a bottom-up approach and not a top-down.
     This will lead to more correct estimates but will require more work.



329. Traditional Mindset Part 3
     Your main job is to be an integrator of the many different components within a project.
     Do not concentrate your time and efforts on one particular thing while ignoring others.
     Update the lesson learned register throughout the entire project.
     This way it can be transferred to future projects in the organization.
     When closing the project ensure all bills are paid off and resources are released.
     Projects that are terminated early still needs to be close formally through the close project or phase process.



330. Traditional Mindset Part 4
     The best people to break down work is the project team.
     The best people to determine when a particular activity may happen is also the project team.

=============================================

General Tips:
     Take this exam very seriously. It is not an easy test to pass.
     Get at least 80% on each of the end-of section quizzes. Keep redoing each one until you understand why the answer
    is correct and the others are wrong. Do not just memorize questions.
     Get over a 80% on the mock exam at the end.
     Read the PMBOK at least once.
     Dedicate study time every week. Try to put in about 6-20 hours per week of study time. Try to study every day.
     Do not just memorize the ITTO’s
     Do not stop studying for an extended period of time.
     Make flash cards with definitions and ITTO’s. You don’t need to buy flash cards. The best flash cards are the ones you
    make yourself.
     Fill out the PMP application on the PMI website (www.pmi.org).
     Preschedule the PMP exam at Prometric (www.prometric.com). Expect to take an entire day off for this.

Day Before the Exam:
     Review formulas and the process table.
     Don’t study too much the day before
     Wake up very early.

     When the exam starts take the first 5-8 minutes to write down the formulas from the section above, as well as the
    process chart.
     Always ask yourself what a PMBOK answer would be. It is generally something that is more process-oriented and
    general. Always evaluate before taking actions.
     Take breaks.
     Technically, you have 72 seconds per question: 240 minutes and 200 questions. Never spend too long on a question.
     When you come to a long question, read the last sentence, glance over the choices, then read the entire question.
     At the end, review the questions you marked. Change the answer only if you are sure about the new choice.
