Â· Rule 4: Always be and appear honest and ethical. Your actions should not only be ethical but also perceived as such by others.

Application of Rules in Scenarios:

Â· Permit Requirements: Obtain permits as required by local laws, even if it causes project delays.

Â· Sponsor's Instructions: Always follow legal and ethical guidelines, even if instructed otherwise by a sponsor or superior.

Â· Honesty in Communication: Always be truthful, especially in project-related communications, regardless of pressure to withhold information.

Â· Accepting Gifts: Only accept gifts if they do not violate local laws, organizational policies, or ethical standards. Avoid accepting gifts in sensitive situations like procurement processes to prevent the perception of bribery.

Additional Ethical Considerations:

Â· Reporting Violations: Report any violations of laws and policies, but only with clear evidence.
