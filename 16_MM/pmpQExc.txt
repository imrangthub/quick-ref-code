Question 1:
    The team is working with the executive management of the company to implement a few new projects and programs to increase revenue by over 50% within the next 3 years. What is the team trying to develop?   
    ans:
    A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs implemented to achieve a strategic (long-term) business goal. All the other choices are made up.


Question 2:
    As the project team is collecting the new project’s requirements, the organization’s legal department has informed them of a new law that could affect the project. The team determines that it is mandatory to implement this new law in the project. What is this called? 
    Ans:
    A regulation is an official guideline that must be followed by the project, usually imposed by local or national law. A standard is a guideline that should be followed, but is not mandatory. A baseline is used to measure the performance of the project, such as cost, schedule, and scope. A system is a set of processes and procedures that a company will implement to manage something, such as accounting procedures to invoice customers.


Question 3:
    Peter is working on a project that he knows little about. He was assigned by the project management office (PMO) 
    and they have almost complete control over the project. What type of PMO best describes this scenario?
    Ans:  Directive
    In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing the projects and assigning the project manager. 
    Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing templates and frameworks. 
    Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control on the project. “Guiding” is not a type of PMO.

Question 4:
    Mary’s new project staff are some of the best talents in the company. The team members will use their own methodologies and prefer to be in control of the project; they would only like to be provided templates and lessons learned  from other projects. What type of PMO would be best for this project? 
    Ans:
    Since the team will be mostly in control and just needs templates, the best fit would be “supportive.” In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing projects and assigning the project manager. Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing methodologies or frameworks. “Managing” is not a type of PMO.

Question 5:
    Pat is working in an organization where she does project management full time. 
    However, she still needs to consult with functional managers in order to acquire her project team. 
    What organizational structure type best describes this situation?   
    Ans:Strong matrix
    In a strong matrix, the project manager is full time and has a moderate to high control over resources. 
    In a weak or functional matrix, project management is part-time. 
    In a project-oriented organization, the project manager has high to complete control over resources.

Question 6:
    Ian has been working on an office remodel project for close to 6 months. 
    He feels like the project is going poorly due to a lack of resources from the functional managers and his lack of time to work 
    on the project. Ian spends most of his day doing operational work. What organizational structure best describes this?   
    Ans:
    In a weak matrix, project management is part-time and resource availability is controlled by the functional manager. 
    All other choices require a full-time project manager.

Question 7:
    ABX Shipping is a large global company with many departments, some of which are have part-time project management and others, 
    such as research and development, where it is full time. 
    Where the project managers work determines their control over resources. What organizational structure best describes this organization?   
    Ans:hybrid
    In a hybrid, the company uses multiple types of structures, such as functional and project-oriented. 
    Answers A and B are not organizational types. 
    Project-oriented requires project managers to be full time and have control over resources.

Question 8:
    Mark has just started a new job as a project coordinator for a company. He will be working with a group to develop their new website. Mark finds working on this project to be difficult due to always needing the company owner’s approval for budget matters. He also has very few resources to work with because the company is very small. What organizational structure best describes this scenario?   
    Ans:organic
    In an organic or simple structure, the owner controls the budget, and there are few to no resources. 
    Answers B and C are not organizational structure types. 
    A weak matrix would have a functional manager to control the budget.

Question 9:
    Mark has just started working for a company that has little to no project management framework or functions. He notices that most people manage projects on their own with no oversight or established processes. Mark has spoken the CEO and they have decided to change this. What is this organization lacking?   
    Ans:
    Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide a company to create a project. The other choices are made up.

Question 10:
    Project management and operations management are sometimes managed by the same set of people. What is one of the key differences between project and operations management?   
    Ans:
    Project management is a temporary endeavor, while operations management is ongoing and never stops. A project manager does not necessarily need to be certified.

Question 11:
    Mark has gotten a new job at a company that is about to create a new product. This new product will be a very complex software that may take years to create and have many different groups of people. Mark has decided to break up this complex project into smaller subprojects and manage them individually. What is Mark managing?   
    Ans:
    A program is a group of related projects that are managed in coordination to obtain the benefits of not managing them individually. A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and other portfolios. A project is a single temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or other result.

Question 12:
    Many organizations have different strategic goals. Which of the following helps an organization attain these goals?
    Ans:
    A portfolio achieves the organization’s strategic objectives. While projects and programs may help complete a portfolio, they may not always achieve strategic objectives in themselves. “Operations” generally maintain an organization’s current processes.


Question 13:
    Mary has just completed one of the most important deliverables of the project. 
    She meets with the organization’s senior management, and they have not determined if the project should continue or not, 
    as the current deliverable may be all they need. What would best describe this review?   
    Ans:Phase Gate
    A phase gate is done at the end of a phase, deciding whether to continue to the next phase or not. 
    A kickoff meeting is generally done at the end of planning and sometimes at the end of the project’s initiated sections 
    in order to start the next section. Answers C and D do not exist.


Question 14:
    What best describes an area of project management where the project manager will work with the project team in order to 
    complete the project work?   
    Ans:“Executing”
    “Executing” is the process group where the project manager acquires both the physical and human resources to complete the project work. 
    The main output of execution is the project deliverables (work). 
    “Initiating” is used to authorize the project, and “planning” is used to determine 
    the course of action needed to build the deliverables. 
    “Closing” is used to review the project and transition the deliverables to the customer or sponsor.


Question 15:
    Project manager Bill has started planning his project and will gather all requirements from his customers, then build the project deliverable in its entirety. Bill will generally not get any input from the customer while the product is being made, and the customer will only review it at the end. What life cycle best describes Bill’s project?     
    Ans:
    A predictive life cycle is when the project scope is known early in the project. For Bill to create the deliverable in its entirety without any feedback from the customer, he will have gathered the scope in its entirety before executing the project. All other choices are adaptive and used in projects when the deliverable is built in increments, with continuous customer feedback.


Question 16:
    Mary has just been awarded a new product development project. After speaking with some of the customers, it seems that they do not know how they would like the product to look and feel. They would like to be more involved in the product development and give Mary continuous feedback. What project life cycle would best fit this project?   
    Ans:
    In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is built in a series of iterations with continuous feedback from project stakeholders. “Predictive” or “waterfall” are the same thing, and are only used when the scope is known early in the project. “Non-predictive” does not exist.


Question 17:
    One phase of the project has been completed, and the stakeholders are very happy with the transition of the project deliverable. 
    What would be the next best step on this project?
    Ans:Phase gate or Phase review
    When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct a phase gate or phase review to 
    determine whether to continue the project or end it. 
    You should not start a phase if you have not reviewed the previously finished phase. 
    Archive project records would have been done in the phase that was just completed. A kickoff meeting is used at the end of 
    planning or when initiating a section of the project in order to start the next section.





Quiz 2: Integration Quiz
---------------------------------------------
Question 1:
A project manager is about to start planning a new sales software development project and will 
work with the project team to create a project management plan. 
What will the project manager and the team not use in planning a project?  
Ans:
Work performance information is an output of monitoring and controlling and is not used during planning. 
The scope statement, scope baseline, and risk register are all created during the planning processes.


Question 2:
The project manager has received a change request from the project sponsor to reduce the budget by 20%. 
After the project manager has reviewed the change, he decides that the only way this can 
be done is by removing a part of the project that is not yet completed. Who should approve this change?   
Ans:
The change control board (CCB) is a group that helps the project manager to assess and deny or approve changes. 
The project team may only help assess the change. “Change approval” and “management board” are made up.


Question 3:
The CEO of a small business has requested that the company’s accounting software be upgraded to better support their financial records. 
He has requested that the software include a report that can forecast the following month’s expenses. 
Where would be the best place the CEO can outline why this project needs to get done?   
Ans:
The business documents contain two parts: the business case and the benefits management plan. 
In this question, the business case would be used to explain why the project would need to get done. 
The “scope outline” is a made-up term. The scope statement and WBS shows the work needed to finish the project.


Question 4:
Project manager Mike worked with the sponsor, Chris, to get the project charter approved for the new office reorganizing project. 
While reviewing the requirements, both Mike and Chris are sure that there is no need to upgrade the office’s current wireless network. 
Where is the best place for Mike and Chis to store this information?   
Ans:
Mike and Chris are making an assumption, as they are sure of their determination but don’t know it for a fact; 
an assumption log is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project. 
A project charter and business case have nothing to do with assumptions. “Assumption documentation” is a made-up term.


Question 5:
While working on creating a project management plan, the project manager has brought a group of expert programmers 
and a planner to ensure it is created correctly. What tool best describes this approach?   
Ans:
The tool that is being used is a focus group, which is part of data gathering. “Meeting” and “interpersonal 
and team skills” do not involve a focus group. Data analysis is used to analyze data that has already been gathered.


Question 6:
When a project has been executed, what input would best help the project manager determine how to manage changes to the project?   
Ans:
The project management plan contains the change management plan. 
The change management plan will outline how changes are requested, assessed, approved, or disapproved. 
The change control board approves or disapproves changes. The term change control chart is a made-up term.


Question 7:
Company XYZ has been executing a new business development project for the last 4 months. 
A few stakeholders have requested changes to the scope and have gotten them approved. 
When a change is approved, what is the next best step to conduct on a project?   
Ans:
Once a change request has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project 
manager will then execute the change in the direct and manage project work process. 
Approved change request is not an input into the processes of monitor and control project work, validate scope, and close project or phase.


Question 8:
A change control board has informed the project manager that a change request made by stakeholder 
Mark to reduce the project schedule by 2 weeks was rejected. What is the first step the project manager should take?   
Ans:
Once a change has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the change log to reflect the status of the change. 
Asking Mark to reduce his change request by 1 week would need a new change request. 
The change was already rejected, there is no need to get the team involved. 
Resubmitting the change request, without any new changes would result in the same outcome.


Question 9:
The deliverable for the product improvement project has been accepted by the sponsor. 
What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the close project or phase process. 
In that process the project manager will discuss the lessons learned and release or reassign the project team. 
A project manager should never leave a project without formally closing it.


Question 10:
Project team member Josh has learned a new method to program the financial application by reading a book about functions in applications. 
What kind of knowledge is this?   
Ans:
Explicit knowledge is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. 
“Tacit” is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. “Common” and “programming” are not types of knowledge.


Question 11:
While executing a project, the project manager has learned that an IT vendor will delay the delivery 
of the server needed to implement the phone system. This problem will need to be resolved soon. What should the PM do first?   
Ans:
The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the issue log. From there, the PM can get a change 
request to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. 
Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the project management plan.


Question 12:
The project team is currently working on the office move project, and they have completed moving one of the floors to the other building. 
While the work is progressing, what document would be best for the project manager to update?   
Ans:
The work performance data will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done. 
The issue log is only updated when there are issues on the project. 
Change logs are only updated once a change request is filed. “Work logs” is a made-up term.


Question 13:
The project sponsor has been asking the project manager to close the project as soon as possible, 
since the deliverable has been created. The project manager has informed the sponsor that the project cannot close yet. 
What best explains why the project manager cannot close the project?   
Ans:
In order for the project or phase to be closed, the deliverable has to be accepted. 
An accepted deliverable is a key input to the process of close project or phase. 
You will release the project team during the close project or phase. If the deliverable was defective, then it would not be considered done.


Question 14:
A company has plans to improve one their products. They have started to work with Mary to get this 
project authorized by the board of directors. What is the output of this process?   
Ans:
The project charter is used to authorize a project. The project management plan and stakeholder register come after the charter is created. 
The business documents are an input to create project charters.


Question 15:
When creating a project management plan what component will address how to approve changes on a project?   
Ans:
The change management plan is a part of the project management plan that describes how to manage changes on a project. 
That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected. The other choices are made up.


Question 16:
A project team has just completed a major module in a new application. 
They were able to complete it in about half the time that was approved for them using a new method from a recent programmers’ publication. 
What should the project manager do first with this new programming method?   
Ans:
Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the lesson learned register. 
This will ensure that the knowledge is saved and can be used throughout the project, as well as on future projects. 
Updating the plan or sponsor will not update the lesson learned register or document the method. 
You cannot close a project or phase if it had not been completed and accepted.


Question 17:
While executing a large project for building a bridge, the PM has received a request that would affect the structure 
of the bridge and may need it to be completely redesigned. The change came from the local transportation department. 
What should the PM do next?   
Ans:
The first step would be to assess the changes and understand how it would affect the project, which may lead to 
stopping the work and redesigning the bridge. 
You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. 
Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.


Question 18:
A phase of a long software development project has been completed. 
The phase was considered very successful: the team was able to complete the deliverables in about half the time and under budget. 
The deliverables were successfully transferred to the next phase of the project. What should the project manager do next for this phase?   
Ans:
The final report is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project. 
While you can initiate or plan another phase on a project, the question does state “for this phase.” “Update project management plan” 
is not an output of close project or phase.


Question 19:
While monitoring and controlling the project, the project manager notices that the project has been 
behind schedule for 2 out of the 3 weeks. The PM thinks it will also be behind schedule this week. 
What kind of data analysis is this?   
Ans:
Trend analysis is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. 
Variance analysis is only used to find a variance, not to predict it. “Prediction analysis” is made up, and expert judgement is 
not part of data analysis.

The WBS dictionary has all details about each work package, such as who is doing it, where it’s getting done, and its cost.


Question 2:
The project manager has met with the company PMO to ask for guidance about creating a scope statement for the project. The PMO had given him all the steps he should follow when creating a scope statement. What document would the project manager best store these steps in?

The scope management plan will outline all the steps the project manager will follow to conduct the scope processes, including defining the scope and creating the WBS.


Question 3:
The project manager has met a few of the team members, and they have decided to document how the software they're working on will function. They record a feature where users will be able to email reports from the software with one click. What document best describes what they are creating?
Ans:
The product scope will outline the product’s features and functionality.


Question 4:
The project manager, Peter, is collecting requirements for the project. He is not sure of the best step to take in order to correctly collect them from the company’s senior management. What document should Peter refer to?   
Ans:
The requirements management plan will outline all the steps the project manager will take to collect, measure, test, and verify requirements.


Question 5:
The project manager, Peter, has met the sponsor, Mary, and has informed her that the project has been delayed due the requirements not being documented correctly. What process was not done correctly during planning?
Ans:
Collect requirements is a process where the requirements are gathered from all stakeholders on the project.


Question 6:
The project team has given the customers access to the new software they created in order to get feedback and see if there is room for improvement. What tool best describes this?   
Ans:
A prototype is used as a tool in the process of collect requirements. It is a working product that is given to users in order to collect feedback and gather their requirements.


Question 7:
The project has conducted a brainstorming session and generated a lot of ideas for their new financial software. The project manager notices that the ideas seem to be in no particular order and would like them to be grouped together. What tool or technique would best help the team?   
Ans:
An affinity diagram is used to group and review ideas.


Question 8:
The project manager has spoken with the customers about what quality requirements there are looking for on the office renovation project. They have specifically said they want to use good quality materials with high durability. Where would be best for the project manager to store this request?   
Ans:
The quality requirements are stored in the requirements documentation, which is an output of collect requirements.


Question 9:
The company has started to work on a new accounting software that would allow the company to better manage their expenses. After they have created the scope statement, they then start to learn more about each deliverable and the efforts needed to produce them. What process best describes this?   
Ans:
“Create WBS” is generally done after the scope statement is created and decomposes the deliverables into work packages.


Question 10:
The project team has completed the deliverables for the project and has checked them to ensure all quality requirements have been met. They have informed the sponsor to review the deliverable with them in order to gain a sign-off on its completion. What tool would be best used in this process?   
Ans:
Inspection is the tool used in the process of validate scope by the stakeholders to formally accept the verified deliverables.


Question 11:
The project manager has noticed that a member of the project team has been doing work that was not in the WBS. When asked why he was doing so, the team member says the sponsor requested the work and he felt he needed it to be done. What process most accurately describes this scenario?   
Ans:
The control scope process is where the project manager compares the planned work to the actual work to ensure there is no variance. If there is a variance a change request might be needed to correct it.




Question 12:
The team is getting ready to break down the deliverables on the scope statement. They are not sure how to conduct this process. What document would best help them?   



Question 13:
The customers of a new office renovation project are not too sure what the project will and will not do. The planning for the project has been completed and it’s now about to be executed. Where can the customers look to see what work the project will not be doing?   
Ans:
The scope statement lists exclusions, or work the project will not be doing.

Ans:
Job shadowing is an example of the observation/conversation part of interpersonal and team skills.


Question 15:
A project team has completed a new smartphone for a major phone manufacturer. During testing they compared their boot time to a few other smartphones made by other companies and realized their phone is very slow by comparison. What could the project team have used to ensure this was addressed during planning?
Ans:
Benchmarking is used on projects to compare its performance or specifications to other projects or industry standards.


Question 16:
While working on a project, the team has encountered many change requests from the customers and sponsor. The project manager has informed the team that the requirements were not collected in detail from the start of the project. What would be the first action the PM and team could take?    
Ans:
The first action the team should take is to identify what was done during the planning processes to gain a better understanding of what went wrong. Then they can redo the process of collect requirements if needed and update the project management plan with the correct requirements.


Question 17:
The project team has completed the new security alarm system for the building and has informed the project manager. The project manager inspected it and verified that it works according to all building and safety regulations. What would be the next process the project manager should conduct?   
Ans:
Since the work has been completed and the project manager has checked the deliverable to ensure it meets the quality requirements, the next process would be to get the sponsors or customers to give a formal acceptance in the validate scope process before closing the project or phase.


Question 18:
During a major construction project of a large building the project manager realizes that the scope didn’t include a new safety regulation. If the building is completed and doesn’t include the regulation the building will not be approved for occupancy. What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
The first action the project manager should take is to analyze how the regulation will affect the project. From there, the project manager might have to get a change request to modify the project management plan to incorporate the regulation.





The best solution here would be to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements in detail. This can include scheduling meetings ahead of time. The project manager should not write the requirements or write a scope statement with just a few of the project requirements. The project has been approved and should not be stopped.
Question 19:
The project manager is having a difficult time collecting requirements from the stakeholders. They never seem to have time to meet with the project manager. What should the project manager do in this situation?

Write the requirements himself
Continue to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements
Create the scope statement from the requirements that have already been collected
Stop the project until they have time to give the requirements


The scope is missing one component, the WBS dictionary. Mary should create it and add it to the scope statement and WBS. The scope baseline is made up of 3 components, the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary.
Question 20:
The project manager, Mary, has completed the scope statement and the WBS for a small project. She has approached the sponsor about gaining approval for the scope baseline. Upon inspection, the sponsor decided the scope baseline doesn’t have enough information in it. What is the best action Mary can take?

Work with the team and create a WBS dictionary
Go back to the collect requirements processes to ensure all requirements were added to the scope baseline
Ask the sponsor to write the scope
Work with the team to create a project schedule and cost baseline

Quiz 4: Schedule Management Quiz
==============================================



Question 1:
While getting ready to manage the project schedule, the project manager would like to document how accurate the schedule must be and what model the team will use to create the schedule. What document would have this information?   
Ans:
The schedule management plan will describe how the schedule will be planned, developed, managed, executed, and controlled throughout the project, as well as the level of accuracy, reporting formats, and schedule model.


Question 2:
In developing the schedule management plan, which of the following tools will the project manager use?   
Ans:
Data analysis is a tool that is used in plan schedule management to create the schedule management plan. The other choices are not tools in this process.


Question 3:
The project manager has met with the project team to define the activities on the project. Which of the following components of the project management plan will the team not use to define the activities?   
Ans:
The WBS, WBS dictionary, and scope statement are part of the scope baseline, which is an input to the process of define activities. The activity list is the output of the process, not an input.


Question 4:
While conducting the process of define activities, a few of the team members have decided to use the lesson learned repository from previous projects. Which of the following inputs describes this lesson learned repository?   
Ans:
The organizational process assets include but are not limited to the lesson learned repository from previous projects and templates. The other choices do not include the lesson learned repository.



Question 5:
The activity lists and WBS are used to help create the scope baseline and the schedule baseline. Which of the following statements is true regarding these two documents?
Ans:
The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently. The WBS is part of the scope baseline, while the activity list is not part of the schedule baseline, only considered a project document.


Question 6:
The project team has embarked on a very complex software development project and is currently having a difficult time decomposing work packages that will be done later; they have decided to decompose these work packages as they get closer to the work. What technique best represents the scenario?   
Ans:
Rolling wave planning is a planning technique in which future work is decomposed as the work gets closer. Decomposition is done to break down the deliverables and work packages into activities. Future planning is not a valid tool or technique.


Question 7:
While decomposing project activities which of the following statements is true regarding the usage of this technique?   
Ans:
Decomposition is best done when the team members are involved, since they are considered subject matter experts and will generally lead to more accurate results. It should be done throughout the project as more work is done and understood. It is not a tool used in sequence activity or defined scope processes.



Question 8:
The project sponsor is examining the project schedule and has noticed a few activities with a duration of zero. What best describes these activities?   
Ans:
Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event on the project. All other choices are made-up terms.


Question 9:
While working on a large building development project the team has identified a particular warehouse they would use to fabricate the steel beams. Where would the team store this information?   
Ans:
The activity attributes can be used to identify the place where the work is to be performed. The activity list is just a list of all activities on the project. The milestone list will identify all milestones on the project. The project schedule network diagram will not show the location of work, just the sequence thereof.


Question 10:
Which of the following methods is used to construct a schedule in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked?   
Ans:
The precedence diagramming method is used to construct a schedule in which the activities are represented graphically using nodes and are linked based on their relationship. The critical path method is used to find the critical path for a network diagram. “Scheduling method” and “diagramming method” are made-up terms.


Question 11:
While working on a large systems upgrade project, the project team has decided that they can install the servers and the workstations at the same time. The activities will all start at the same time but the workstation installations will take a bit longer to finish. What relationship best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
The relationship of “start to start” is when a successor activity cannot start until the predecessor activity has started. This means that they both generally started the same time, but they may not finish at the same time.



Question 12:
While working on a network installation project the project team has determined that they must finish the router configurations before they can set up the workstations. The workstations cannot be set up until the router configurations are done. What kind of dependency does this best describes?   
Ans:
Mandatory dependencies are dependencies in which one activity must be done in order for another activity to start. Discretionary dependencies are when the sequence of activities does not necessarily have to be done in that particular order, but is usually at the discretion of the person doing the work. “Physical dependency” is a made-up term.




Question 13:
The project team has filed for a permit in order to continue building the foundation for a large office building. The permit usually takes about 6 weeks to arrive, and the team is worried it may take even longer. What kind of dependency best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
External dependency is when the work is outside of the project team’s control, such as getting a permit. Internal dependency is usually within the project team’s control. “Permit dependency” is a made-up term.



Question 14:
The builders have completed the foundation for the large office building. Upon completion, they have filed a permit, and are told by the permit office that they will have to wait about 3 weeks for inspection. How should these 3 weeks be represented in the project schedule?   
Ans:
A lag is a delay between activities. Although “delay” is a somewhat correct answer, using the term “lag” is more appropriate for a PMP exam. A lead is an overlap of work on a project.




Question 15:
While installing the servers and workstations on a project, the team has decided that they do not have to wait for all the servers to be installed before they start installing the workstations. They have decided to install just a few of the main servers, and then they can start installing the workstations. What best describes what they’re doing on the schedule?   
Ans:
A lead is an overlap between activities, in which one activity can start before the other activity is done. Although “overlap” would be a good choice, the term “lead” is a better answer for a PMP question. A lag is a delay between activities.




Question 16:
While estimating the duration of activities on the project, the project team has decided to base most of their estimates on historical data from a project they completed a few months ago that is very similar to the current project. This would allow them to complete the estimate fairly quickly. What technique best illustrates this scenario?   
Ans:
Analogous estimating is based on historical information, generally from previous projects that were very similar. This technique would lead to a quick estimate, but may not be very accurate. Expert judgment is using subject matter experts in order to estimate the duration, and bottom-up estimation is done by aggregating the work in order to come up with the duration. Parametric estimating is usually a mathematical model based on historical information.



Question 17:
While working on a complex software development project, the project team has added an additional month to the project schedule due to the uncertainty of the work getting done. What type of reserve does this represent?   
Ans:
“Contingency reserve” is associated with a known-unknown and is usually added to the project management plan. A management reserve is generally for an unknown-unknown and not added to the project management plan. “Risk” and “expert judgment reserves” are made-up terms.



Question 18:
The project team has completed all duration estimates for the activities on the project and has indicated that their estimates should be within a -10 to +10% range. Where should the project team store this range? 
Ans:
The basis of estimates would generally indicate the range of possible estimates. The schedule baseline and schedule management plan will not indicate the possible range of the estimates, while the activity list is simply a list of activities that will take place on the project.



Question 19:
The project manager is constructing the project schedule and would like to know the minimum duration needed to complete the project. What method can he used to determine the minimum duration?   
Ans:
The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule flexibility. The precedence diagramming method is used to construct the project schedule network diagram showing the dependencies between activities. The “scheduling” and “duration” methods are made-up terms.



Question 20:
The project sponsor has indicated to the project manager that he is not happy with the current project schedule. He would like the project to be completed at least 3 months earlier than its scheduled completion date. What technique can the project manager use to compress the schedule while minimizing cost?   
Ans:
“Fast tracking” the schedule is a compression technique in which activities are generally done in parallel. This technique generally increases the risk on the project but may not increase costs. “Crashing” is adding more resources to the project to finish it faster, and will increase costs.



Question 21:
Due to the complex nature of a construction project, the project manager has decided that the project is best done outside normal working hours, generally overnight. Where should the project manager document this information?   
Ans:
A project calendar identifies the working days and shifts that the project will follow.



Question 22:
While working on an agile project, what can the project manager do in order to track the work that remains to be completed on the project?   
Ans:
An iteration burndown chart shows the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. “Earned value analysis” is a series of formulas that assess project performance and progress. Expert judgment is about using subject matter experts, and trend analysis is to see whether the project is staying on or off schedule.

Quiz 5: Cost Management Quiz
==============================================

Question 1:
When developing the cost management plan, what tool or technique includes reviewing the different funding options that can be used to fund the project?   
Ans:
Data analysis includes alternative analysis, which includes reviewing strategic funding options. Meetings and expert judgment do not examine different funding options. External funding is not a valid tool.


Question 2:
While working on a multinational project, the project manager has decided to represent the project budget in American dollars, even though the project will span nine different countries. This will make the budget uniform and easier for the stakeholders to understand. Where will the project manager document the units of measurement for the budget?   
Ans:
The cost management plan can establish the units of measurement which would include the currency format. All other choices are fake plans.



Question 3:
Early in the project’s planning phase, the project team determined that the cost to install a server would be $15,000. This is a high-level estimate, and the team thinks it may cost up to $10,000 more. What kind of estimate is this?   
Ans:
A rough order of magnitude estimate has a range of -25% to +75%. A definitive estimate is generally within the range of -5% to +10%. Wide and plan estimates are not actual types of estimates.


Question 4:
Cost estimates for activities generally include the cost for labor, materials, equipment, services, and facilities. Which of the following statements is false regarding cost estimates?   
Ans:
Cost estimates for project activities should not include the operational costs of the product, since those costs cover operations and not a project. All other choices are true.



Question 5:
While working on a game design project, the project sponsor has asked the project manager to ensure that his estimates are very precise. What estimating technique should the project manager use?   
Ans:
Bottom-up estimating is when work packages are broken down and then rolled back up to form an overall cost estimate. This can lead to a very precise estimate, although it requires the most amount of work. Analogous estimating is a quick estimate that is based on previous projects. Three-point estimating uses the PERT formula and may or may not be accurate . Accuracy estimating is a made-up term.




Question 6:
The project manager and the project team determined that the budget for the project will be $60,000. That includes the cost for all the activities and all uncertainties that may have taken place during the project. The project cost baseline is $60,000. The sponsor has determined that if there is a need for additional funds, he will add an additional $5,000. The additional $5,000 represents what?     
Ans:
Management reserves are added to the cost baseline in case the project exceeds its budget. It is usually added by the company’s management and is not under the manager’s control. Contingency reserves are part of the cost baseline. Risk and sponsor reserves are made-up terms.



Question 7:
The project manager has worked with an expert project team to estimate the project’s cost. The project manager is very confident that the project will end at that budget. Where should the project manager document his or her confidence level of the cost estimate?   
Ans:
The basis of the estimates will have an indication of the confidence level of the final estimate. No other choice will document the confidence level of an estimate.


Question 8:
When determining the budget for a project, what tool should the project manager use to sum the cost of each work package to form the entire project budget? 
Ans:
Cost aggregation is when you take the work packages and aggregate their individual cost to find the entire project budget. Data analysis does not contain any cost segregation, and neither does decision making. WBS aggregation is a made-up term.



Question 9:
The project manager has just been told by the project sponsor that, due to a current recession in the stock market, the company will not be able to allocate all of the funds that the project will need for completion. What should the project manager do with this funding limit? 
Ans:
In the process of determining budget, the funding limit reconciliation tool is handled by rescheduling work. Implementing a change request may not help, since the organization will not have the money; closing the project will not resolve the funding problems; and seeking external funding may not be an option.



Question 10:
The project manager has completed the process of determining budget. He has created the cost baseline, which will be added to the project management plan. The project manager is also aware of the project budget. What is the difference between the project budget and cost baseline?     
Ans:
The cost baseline includes the cost of all activities, plus the contingency reserves, and the management reserves includes the cost baseline, plus the management reserves.



Question 11:
In the process of control costs, the project manager compares the project management plan with what other information?  
Ans:
In almost all monitoring and controlling processes, the project manager compares the project plan with the work performance data to determine if the project is on track.


Question 12:
The project manager is currently evaluating how well the project is meeting the project budget. What earned value formula will be needed to determine if a project is on or over budget?   
Ans:
To determine if a project is on or over budget, you will need to calculate the CV or CPI, both of which use the AC value.


Question 13:
The budget manager has completed the earned value analysis for the project. He has concluded that the CPI of the project is .9. Which of the following statements best describes this project? 
Ans:
The cost performance index (CPI) is a measurement of the cost efficiency of the budgeted resources. The number being one represents the project being on budget. A number below one illustrates the project being over budget. At .9, the project is 10% over budget.



Question 14:
The project manager has calculated the EV of the project to be $14,000 and the PV to be $16,000. The BAC is currently at $22,000. Which statement best describes this project?   
Ans:
If you are to calculate this project’s SV, you would have gotten a negative number. To calculate the SV, subtract PV from EV, which is $14,000-$16,000 = -$2,000. This project is behind schedule by $2,000 worth of work.



Question 15:
While working on a multinational project with a budget of $90,000, the team has completed the design aspect of the project. You have calculated that the AC is $30,000 and the EV is $32,000. What is the EAC of this project?   
Ans:
To find out the EAC, you will need the BAC and CPI. You currently have the BAC, which is $90,000. The CPI is equal to EV/AC = $32,000/$30,000 = $1.06. So, the EAC is equal to $90,000/$1.06 = $84,906.




Question 16:
When creating the cost baseline, the project manager uses an S-curve graph to represent the baseline. Which of the following statements is true about the S-curve?   
Ans:
The S-curve is a time phase view of the cost baseline, which typically shows the budget versus the actual amount spent on the project.



Question 17:
Which one of the following is FALSE about TCPI?   
Ans:
TCPI calculates the performance that must be achieved to meet financial or schedule goals and determines the status of the remaining work with respect to the remaining funds. If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline plan, all future work must be performed AT the TCPI to achieve the planned BAC.


Question 18:
Earned Value Management (EVM) would NOT be very beneficial in which situation?   
Ans:
Earned value analysis provides a means by which to determine cost and schedule variances, not to develop the project cost baseline.


Question 19:
While developing complex software, the project manager decided to bill the company by how many lines of codes it will take to write the software. What type of estimate best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
Parametric estimating uses mathematical models based on historical records from other projects. It utilizes the statistical relationship that exists between a series of historical data and a particular delineated list of other variables.



Question 20:
Which of the following statements would be considered false about a project that has an SPI of 1.2 and the CPI of .7?
Ans:
Of the choices, the only answer that could be incorrect would be that the project is being fast tracked, since fast tracking generally results in a shorter schedule but does not affect costs. All other choices are 100% true, since the project is over budget but ahead of schedule.






Quiz 6: Quality Quiz
==============================================

Question 1:
A project manager working on a phone development project has met with the project team to determine the grade and quality of the product. The phone requires only basic functionality to be sold in emerging markets. What should the quality and grade be for the project?   
Ans:
All project deliverables should be high quality but not necessarily high grade. A low-grade product will not have as much functionality as a high-grade product. This question asks about a low-functionality product.




Question 2:
The project manager has met with the project team to determine when to do the inspections on the project. The project manager would like to do minimal inspections but still have a high-quality product. Which of the following actions would lead to fewer inspections but higher quality?   
Ans:
Quality is about prevention. The more a defect is prevented, the fewer inspections will be needed. For example, hiring a well-trained programmer would require fewer code inspections.



Question 3:
Which of the following statements about quality management is false?   
Ans:
It is always more expensive to let the customers find defects. This can lead to warranty issues, recalls, or loss of reputation. All of the other choices are true.



Question 4:
While working on a product redesign project, the project manager has met with the company’s senior management to inform them that they need to provide adequate resources to ensure the product’s quality. Which of the following statements is true about management’s responsibility regarding quality?   
Ans:
Management is responsible for quality throughout the organization in operations and project management.



Question 5:
The company has informed all company employees that they must pay careful attention to the work that they are doing to ensure the company delivers a quality product. What quality management theory best illustrates this scenario?
Ans:
Total quality management (TQM) is when everyone in the company is responsible for quality in the underlying process of how a product is made.


Question 6:
The project team has met with the project manager to develop the quality management plan and the quality metrics. What project documents contain the product quality requirements that the team would use to create quality metrics? 
Ans:
The requirements documentation includes the project and the product quality requirements. The requirements management plan will document how to manage the project requirements, and the traceability matrix will show the origin of the requirements.




Question 7:
While developing a smart phone, the project team has decided to look at other smart phones in the market to see how fast they start. The team members know that to be competitive, they will need to meet the startup times of the smart phones currently on the market. What tool would best help the project team in this scenario?   
Ans:
Benchmarking is a tool used to compare the standards of comparable projects or products. This can include meeting certain parameters that are industry specific.



Question 8:
While planning a project’s quality, the project team has identified certain costs that would need to be included in the project budget, such as testing, inspections, and having the right equipment to do the job. What best describes these costs?   
Ans:
The cost of quality includes the cost of conformance, which usually includes prevention costs, such as training, equipment, appraisal costs, testing, and inspections. The nonconformance cost includes reworking, scrapping, and the loss of business. All other choices are made-up terms.



Question 9:
The project team would like to document the sequence of steps that the process should follow to ensure that the deliverables are being made with the correct quality requirements. What tool can best help the team show the sequence of steps and whether there’s any room for improvement in a given process?
Ans:
A flowchart is sometimes called a process diagram, which can display the sequence of steps a given process will follow. Process charts and process improvement charts are made-up terms. The cost of quality examines the conformance and nonconformance cost of quality.



Question 10:
After a brainstorming session, the team members have accumulated a lot of different ideas that they can use to ensure the development of a good quality product. Their next step is to organize this information in a visual chart to make it easier for other stakeholders to understand. What method can best help the team?
Ans:
Mind mapping is a method used to visually organize information. A flowchart can display the sequence of the steps that the process will follow. The critical path method is used to find the minimum duration on a network diagram. An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a cause and effect diagram, shows the reasons for potential cause.




Question 11:
The project’s team members have documented what quality standards are to be used on the project and the different roles and responsibilities for quality management on the project. What project component will store this information?   
Ans:
The quality management plan includes the quality standards to be used on the project, the quality objectives of the project, and the quality roles and responsibilities.




Question 12:
What in quality management describes a project or product attribute and how the quality control process will verify compliance to it?
Ans:
Quality metrics specifically describe a project or product attribute and how the control quality process will verify compliance to it. Examples can include a task completed on time, the failure rate, or the number of defects identified per day.




Question 13:
Manage quality is a process that is done to increase the probability of meeting a project’s quality requirements. From what other process does manage quality get the data needed to improve quality management?   
Ans:
The manage quality process uses the data and results from the control quality process to ensure that the quality is being improved and met.



Question 14:
When managing project quality, what process does the project manager follow to ensure that the processes the project adheres to will produce a quality deliverable?   
Ans:
Manage quality is a process that improves the quality management processes the project will follow to produce a quality deliverable. It uses data from the control quality process, in particular, the quality control measurements.




Question 15:
While working for a large, multinational project, the project manager meets with the project sponsor to talk about managing quality on the project. The sponsor would like to know whose job it is to manage the quality on the project. What should the project manager’s response be?  
Ans:
Managing quality is considered to be everybody’s job, including the project manager, project team, project sponsor, and the management of the performing organization—even the customers are involved.



Question 16:
The project team is having a difficult time identifying the main cause of the quality defects in the deliverables. What tool can best help the project team identify the reason(s) for these defects?   
Ans:
An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram, is used to help identify the causes of problems. Histograms are bar charts that can show frequencies, and a matrix diagram will help show a relationship in a process. A scatter diagram will show the relationship between two variables.


Question 17:
The organization’s senior management is not happy with the quality of the project deliverables so far. They have decided that an audit on the project’s quality management is necessary. Who would best be selected to conduct the quality audit?
Ans:
Quality audits are best done by a team external to the project. This ensure that there are no conflicts of interest during the audit and that the results are objective.




Question 18:
While designing a product, senior management informed the project manager that the product should be cost-effective, as the product will be sold in a developing country. What technique could the project managers use to ensure that the product’s design is cost-effective?   
Ans:
Designed for X is a technique that can be used to help design a product for a particular characteristic. In this example, it’s designed for cost, in which case the product would be designed to be cost-effective. X is a variable that can stand for reliability, deployment, assembly, cost, or safety.





Question 19:
The deliverables of the project have been completed, and the project team has decided to inspect the product to ensure that it has met the quality requirements. What process will the team use to inspect the deliverable for quality requirements?
Ans:
Control quality ensures that the deliverables have met the quality requirements by inspecting them. Manage quality ensures that the quality management processes are being met and improved on. Plan quality management creates the quality management plan and describes the quality metrics. Perform quality assurance is not a PMBOK process.



Question 20:
The project manager has met the project team, and they have created a control chart to determine whether the quality processes are stable and if it needs to be improved. They have taken a sample of 30 deliverables that are produced in a row and have identified that six of them are consecutively above the middle line between the upper and lower limits. What should the project team do next?
Ans:
A control chart follows the rule of seven, which specifies that there must be seven consecutive points above or below the middle line, which is the average of the data points, for the process to be out of control. If a process is out of control, then the project manager will need to implement specific actions to fix the process.

Question 1:
While managing a project, the project manager needs to be aware of the different types of resources on a project. Equipment, materials, facilities and infrastructure would be considered what type of resources?
Ans:
There are two types of resources on a project: team and physical resources. Team resources are the personnel who will work on the project, and physical resources are the things they will use to complete the work, such as equipment or materials. All other choices are not valid types of resources.



Question 2:
An organization has decided to use agile methods on their next project. How will the organization describe an agile project team?   
Ans:
In an agile project the team is self-organizing and the project manager will provide a supporting environment and trust that the team will do the job correctly.





Question 3:
To save money on a new project, the organization’s senior management has decided to use virtual teams instead of co-locating the entire project’s team. They have acquired the latest technology in audio and video conferencing. What is a potential issue that a virtual team might face?
Ans:
One challenge a virtual team will face is the possibility of feeling isolated, since most workers will generally work by themselves in an isolated place in their homes. Scheduling meetings can be done easily with technology. One major advantage of virtual teams is that a diverse set of experts can work on a project. Also, technology allows people with disabilities to easily communicate and work on projects.



Question 4:
The project team is using an assignment matrix, particularly a RACI chart. What is an important rule the team should use when using a RACI chart?   
Ans:
When using a RACI chart, one person must be held accountable for each activity listed on the chart.



Question 5:
The project manager has completed the resource management plan and has decided to lay out what could be considered acceptable behavior by the project team members. Where will the project manager communicate the ground rules on the project?    
Ans:
The team charter establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members. The project charter authorizes the project manager to manage the project. All other choices are made-up terms.



Question 6:
Which stakeholders would be the best to create the team charter?   
Ans:
The team charter works best when the team helps develop it or at least has the ability to contribute to its creation, since it will outline acceptable behavior on the project.



Question 7:
Senior management and the project sponsor will hold a meeting about the current project in 2 days. They have requested a breakdown of the different resources that the project will use. What document should the project manager show during the meeting to display the resources by type?   
Ans:
The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type. The basis of estimate would show supporting details for why a particular resource was assigned to an activity. Resource requirements will describe what and how many resources are needed for each activity on the project.


Question 8:
Which of the following statements is false about the process of acquire resources?   
Ans:
The process of acquire resources is done throughout the project at certain intervals, as different resources are released and new resources join the project. All other statements are true.



Question 9:
The project management plan has been completed, and the project manager has just executed the project. His next task will be to select the team members to work on the project. What are some criteria  the project manager should be using when selecting team members?
Ans:
While they are many different criteria a project manager can use when selecting a team member, age and religion should not be one of them.



Question 10:
The project manager has assigned many resources to work on the project. Some team members will work on weekdays and a few on weekends. What should the project manager do next?
Ans:
Once team members have been assigned to the project, the project manager should create a resource calendar to show their availability while working on the project.



Question 11:
The project manager has brought the team members together, and they have introduced themselves to each other and learned about the project. After this, the team starts to disagree about how the work on the project should be done. What stage of Tuckman’ s ladder is the team currently at?
Ans:
The storming stage comes after the forming stage on the Tuckman’ s ladder. During the storming stage, the team begins to address the project work and may have conflicts with each other.




Question 12:
The project manager realizes that a lot of the team members are feeling isolated from each other. So, the project manager rents a meeting room where they can all get together and discuss a few of the project’s issues in a face-to-face setting. What tool is the project manager using?
Ans:
A colocation is a place where team members meet in the same physical location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. All other choices are made-up terms.



Question 13:
Project manager Mark does not believe that his team can complete the work without him inspecting the work throughout the project. His distrust of the project team has led to conflicts with different team members. What theory is Mark following to manage his team?
Ans:
Theory X is a theory that involves managers who distrust their workers and believe that people do not like to work and need to be managed consistently. They’re mostly known as micromanagers and can lead to poor team morale.




Question 14:
Project manager Mark has been assigned to the software development project. Mark has more than 20 years of experience as a software developer, and all of the team members are very happy that he is currently leading the team. They go to him for technical and management-related issues on the project. What form of power best describes Mark’s power on the project?
Ans:
Expert power is when the project manager is considered to be an expert in the field in which the project is taking place. The other choices are made-up forms of power.



Question 15:
While working with the project team, the project manager has been looking into the different strengths and weaknesses of the team as a whole and the individual members. He has found that some members are very strong as leaders and some members are strong in technical roles. What tool is the project manager currently using?   
Ans:
Individual and team assessment is used in the process of developing the team. It is done to gain insight into strengths and weaknesses for the team and its members.



Question 16:
While working on the product redesign project, the project manager has encountered different issues with the team members. He has been able to solve most of the issues between the team members while still working with other members to find solutions. What process is the project manager using?   
Ans:
The process of manage team is about tracking team members’ performance, providing feedback, and resolving issues. Develop team is about bringing the team together and ensuring that members work together efficiently. Acquire resources is done throughout the project to acquire the different team and physical resources needed to complete the project’s activities. Control resources is done to manage the physical resources for the project.



Question 17:
While working on the software development project, project manager Mary has encountered an issue between Mark, the lead programmer, and Peter, the designer. Peter notes that the way that Mark is programming the application means it will not work in a production environment. What should Mary do next?
Ans:
When a project manager encounters an issue, the first step is to get as much information about the issue as possible before taking any kind of action. Taking action without first understanding an issue can lead to the wrong actions being taken.



Question 18:
While working on the network upgrade project, team members Bill and Mark have an issue regarding how to upgrade the routers and firewalls. Bill says both devices should have a certain configuration, while Mark says both devices need another set of configurations. The project manager has met with both of them, and after analyzing the issue, the only solution they came up with was to have Mark configure the router and bill configure the firewall. What conflict resolution best illustrates this solution?   
Ans:
Compromise is determining a solution in which both sides generally give up something to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This is known as a lose–lose situation.



Question 19:
The project manager has just joined the project, as the previous project manager was not getting along with the project team. The project manager’s first action is to inspire the team to complete the project work. What interpersonal and team skills is the project manager using?   
Ans:
Leadership is the ability to lead a team and inspire members to do their jobs well. Conflict management is used to resolve issues between team members. Decision making is used to make decisions about what should come next on a project. Influencing is the ability to persuade individuals to take a position on something.



Question 20:
While managing a small office renovation project, the project manager is disappointed that the team is misusing the physical resources available to them. They seem to be overusing the resources, leading to a cost increase on the project, to purchase more resources. What process did the project manager fail to perform since the project was executed?   
Ans:
Control resources is the process of ensuring that the physical resources that are assigned to the project are being utilized as planned. In this scenario, it seems that the project manager failed to perform this process after the start of the project, which led to the team incorrectly utilizing physical resources. Acquire resources is an executing process that is used to acquire the team and physical resources. Manage and develop resources are not actual PMBOK processes.

Ans:
Risk identification is done throughout the project. As the project progresses, new risks will emerge and will have to be assessed by the project team.




Question 5:
What kind of risk is about uncertainties that exist regarding what might happen in the future and cannot be predicted currently, such as regulatory frameworks or the future development of technology?   
Ans:
Ambiguity risks describe the uncertainty that exists about what might happen in the future and are very difficult to predict, such as future regulations or changes in technology.




Question 6:
The project manager knows that managing risks is an important part of a project. One of the most important aspects is documenting the stakeholders’ risk appetite. Where would the project manager document the stakeholders’ risk appetite?      
Ans:
The stakeholders’ risk appetite is documented and stored in the risk management plan. The stakeholders’ risk appetite is an important component of the plan, since it will help determine what risks will be acceptable.




Question 7:
Senior management within the organization has requested a brief overview of how the project conducts risk management. They would like to see the different categories of risk that can affect the project. What should the project manager show them?
Ans:
The risk breakdown structure is part of the risk management plan, and it shows the different categories of risk on a project.




Question 8:
During the process of identify risks, the project manager has determined that the project team should be included as stakeholders who identify risks for the project. Which of the following statement is true about this approach?
Ans:
During the process of identify risks, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to help identify individual project risks. This will lead to a more thorough risk register and include perspectives from all people affected by the project.



Question 9:
The project team is currently doing data analysis to help identify which risks can affect the project. What data analysis technique can they use to help determine if there are certain risks in the procurement agreement that can affect the project?   
Ans:
Document analysis is a structured review of the different project documents that could include contracts, agreements, and different parts of the project plan.




Question 10:
The project team has started to identify risks on the project. What method can they best use to identify both positive and negative risks while analyzing how strengths may offset threats and vice versa?   

Ans:
The SWOT analysis is done to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a project. This strengths and opportunities are positive risks, and the weaknesses and threats are the negative risks. By putting this into a quadrant diagram, the project team can see how strengths may offset threats, and vice versa.




Question 11:
The project team members have finished identifying risks up to this point in the project. They have created the risk register, which lists all of the individual project risks. What should the team create next?
Ans:
The risk report is generally created with the risk register or after the risk register. It includes information on the sources of overall project risks and a summary of information on the identified individual project risks.




Question 12:
The project manager has met with the legal department within the organization to be informed of a new regulation that was recently passed that may impact the project. The project manager has added this risk to the risk register. What process should the project manager do next?   
ans:
Once a risk has been identified, the next step is to determine how the risks will impact the project. This can be done by either doing a qualitative and/or a quantitative analysis. Sometimes, these two analyses are done sequentially, in which case a qualitative analysis is done followed by a quantitative analysis, or they can be done in parallel. Do not respond to a risk if you do not understand how the risk will impact the project.





Question 13:
The project team members are reviewing the risk in the risk register to determine which risks will have the greatest impact on a project. One risk in particular has a very high impact but the team has determined that this risk should be ranked very low on the project. What statement best describes why this risk is ranked so low?   
Ans:
It is very likely that some risks may have a high impact and a low probability, which will lead to the risk being ranked very low. An example is an earthquake in New York City. The impact may be high, but the probability of it occurring may be very low, which leads to the risk being ranked lower.




Question 14:
The project team members are currently doing the process of perform qualitative risk analysis. They would like to use a tool that could not only display the probability of the risks or impact but the overall likelihood of the risks. What tool can be used to display the three parameters?     
Ans:
A bubble chart is part of the tool data representation. It is used to display three dimensions of data. All other choices may only displays two dimensions.






Question 15:
While conducting a brainstorming session with the team in order to rank the risks, the project manager is worried about the data the team is using to rank the risks. The project manager feels that some team members may only be speculating about what the probability of a risks would be. What tool can best help the project manager in this scenario?
Ans:
Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about the individual risks is accurate and reliable. If this data is not accurate then the entire assessment may be compromised and will not truly reflect the risk ranking on a project.












Question 16:
The project manager and team has determined that if a flood were to take place during the building renovation project, it would delay the project by 2 weeks and cost approximately $50,000 in damages. What process did the project manager and team complete to collect these data?
Ams:
Quantitative risk analysis is a numerical analysis of how the risk will impact the project. This is in contrast to a qualitative analysis, which would just rank the risks from the most important to the least important. The project team did not come up with a response to the flood risks in this scenario, so the choice cannot be to plan a risk response. Identify risk is used to create the risk register, and a risk report does not evaluate the risks.



Question 17:
The project team has identified, ranked, and determined how the risks will impact the project. One risk in particular is a new regulation that may pass and could have a severe effect on the project and on the entire organization. What risk response strategy would be best for the team to take?  
Ans:
Since this is a risk that will not just affect the project but the entire organization, the project team should escalate the risk toward a portfolio or the organization level. Let the organization’s legal department communicate with the project manager and determine how to respond.






Question 18:
The project team members are coming up with ways to respond to an opportunity that they feel will not likely happen. The opportunity is that the permit for the building renovation project comes earlier than its supposed six-week wait. Since the permit office is so backed up, the project team members have decided that if the permit does come earlier than 6 weeks, they will still start the work in 6 weeks. What risk response strategy does this illustrate?   
Ans:
success alert
Good job!
Acceptance of an opportunity is to take no proactive action before it happens. In this scenario, the team is making no proactive response. If the permit comes earlier, the team will still start the work in the 6 weeks that it would take for the permit to come normally.



Question 19:
While working on a 60-story skyscraper project, one supplier has informed the project manager that due to dangerous weather at the warehouse, the materials will be anywhere 1 to 2 months late. The project manager has already accounted for this risk and has decided to go with another supplier to get the materials. What process best illustrates this scenario?  
Ans:
In this scenario, the project manager is implementing the risk response. The project manager is not trying to identify risks or plan a response.


Question 20:
During the process of monitor risks, the project manager works with the organization to determine the effectiveness of the risk management processes. They have determined that the risk processes for the project are adequate and that no changes should be made. What tool best describes this?   
Ams:
Audits are done by the organization to determine the effectiveness of the risk management processes for a project.

Question 6:
The project team has determined they will use an outside consultant to configure the network routers on the network upgrade project. They’re not sure what type of configuration they should put in the routers or how it should be done. They will depend on the expertise of the consultant. They would also like to keep the risks as low as possible. What contract best fits this project?   
Ans:
Although the question states that they would like to keep risks low, and a time and material contract has the highest risk, the project team does not have a detailed project scope. Without a detailed project scope, you cannot use firm fixed-price or even cost-reimbursable contracts, such as cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.



Question 7:
While working on the office renovation project, the project manager has received multiple bids from different vendors. What the project manager thought would be a cost-effective contract turned out to be very expensive. The project manager then hires a professional estimator to determine what the contract should cost. What is the project manager looking for?   
Ans:
An independent cost estimate is generally made by hiring an outside professional estimator to provide a benchmark to determine whether the bids from a seller are adequate for the project.



Question 8:
While preparing different documents to procure work for the project, the project manager creates the procurement statement of work and the procurement management plan. What is the difference between the two documents?   
Ans:

Where should the project manager include the insurance and performance bonds?   








Question 14:
After being awarded the contract, the seller has begun to do the work listed in the contract. The project manager has also started to inspect the work to ensure that it is getting done according to the contract. What process best describes these activities?     
Ans:
Control procurement is part of the monitoring and controlling process groups in which both the buyer and seller meet the requirements outlined in the contract.



Question 15:

Ans:
A cost-reimbursable contract has two subtypes, cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts. The contract described in the question is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, in which the project team will purchase all the project materials and then pay the seller a flat fee for their profits.




Question 17:
The procurement is now completed and the seller has completed all the work in the contract. Who should approve all of the deliverables prior to closure of the procurement?
