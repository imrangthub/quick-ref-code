Question 1:
    The team is working with the executive management of the company to implement a few new projects and programs to increase revenue by over 50% within the next 3 years. What is the team trying to develop?   
    ans:
    A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs implemented to achieve a strategic (long-term) business goal. All the other choices are made up.


Question 2:
    As the project team is collecting the new project’s requirements, the organization’s legal department has informed them of a new law that could affect the project. The team determines that it is mandatory to implement this new law in the project. What is this called? 
    Ans:
    A regulation is an official guideline that must be followed by the project, usually imposed by local or national law. A standard is a guideline that should be followed, but is not mandatory. A baseline is used to measure the performance of the project, such as cost, schedule, and scope. A system is a set of processes and procedures that a company will implement to manage something, such as accounting procedures to invoice customers.


Question 3:
    Peter is working on a project that he knows little about. He was assigned by the project management office (PMO) 
    and they have almost complete control over the project. What type of PMO best describes this scenario?
    Ans:  Directive
    In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing the projects and assigning the project manager. 
    Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing templates and frameworks. 
    Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control on the project. “Guiding” is not a type of PMO.

Question 4:
    Mary’s new project staff are some of the best talents in the company. The team members will use their own methodologies and prefer to be in control of the project; they would only like to be provided templates and lessons learned  from other projects. What type of PMO would be best for this project? 
    Ans:
    Since the team will be mostly in control and just needs templates, the best fit would be “supportive.” In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing projects and assigning the project manager. Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing methodologies or frameworks. “Managing” is not a type of PMO.

Question 5:
    Pat is working in an organization where she does project management full time. 
    However, she still needs to consult with functional managers in order to acquire her project team. 
    What organizational structure type best describes this situation?   
    Ans:Strong matrix
    In a strong matrix, the project manager is full time and has a moderate to high control over resources. 
    In a weak or functional matrix, project management is part-time. 
    In a project-oriented organization, the project manager has high to complete control over resources.

Question 6:
    Ian has been working on an office remodel project for close to 6 months. 
    He feels like the project is going poorly due to a lack of resources from the functional managers and his lack of time to work 
    on the project. Ian spends most of his day doing operational work. What organizational structure best describes this?   
    Ans:
    In a weak matrix, project management is part-time and resource availability is controlled by the functional manager. 
    All other choices require a full-time project manager.

Question 7:
    ABX Shipping is a large global company with many departments, some of which are have part-time project management and others, 
    such as research and development, where it is full time. 
    Where the project managers work determines their control over resources. What organizational structure best describes this organization?   
    Ans:hybrid
    In a hybrid, the company uses multiple types of structures, such as functional and project-oriented. 
    Answers A and B are not organizational types. 
    Project-oriented requires project managers to be full time and have control over resources.

Question 8:
    Mark has just started a new job as a project coordinator for a company. He will be working with a group to develop their new website. Mark finds working on this project to be difficult due to always needing the company owner’s approval for budget matters. He also has very few resources to work with because the company is very small. What organizational structure best describes this scenario?   
    Ans:organic
    In an organic or simple structure, the owner controls the budget, and there are few to no resources. 
    Answers B and C are not organizational structure types. 
    A weak matrix would have a functional manager to control the budget.

Question 9:
    Mark has just started working for a company that has little to no project management framework or functions. He notices that most people manage projects on their own with no oversight or established processes. Mark has spoken the CEO and they have decided to change this. What is this organization lacking?   
    Ans:
    Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide a company to create a project. The other choices are made up.

Question 10:
    Project management and operations management are sometimes managed by the same set of people. What is one of the key differences between project and operations management?   
    Ans:
    Project management is a temporary endeavor, while operations management is ongoing and never stops. A project manager does not necessarily need to be certified.

Question 11:
    Mark has gotten a new job at a company that is about to create a new product. This new product will be a very complex software that may take years to create and have many different groups of people. Mark has decided to break up this complex project into smaller subprojects and manage them individually. What is Mark managing?   
    Ans:
    A program is a group of related projects that are managed in coordination to obtain the benefits of not managing them individually. A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and other portfolios. A project is a single temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or other result.

Question 12:
    Many organizations have different strategic goals. Which of the following helps an organization attain these goals?
    Ans:
    A portfolio achieves the organization’s strategic objectives. While projects and programs may help complete a portfolio, they may not always achieve strategic objectives in themselves. “Operations” generally maintain an organization’s current processes.


Question 13:
    Mary has just completed one of the most important deliverables of the project. 
    She meets with the organization’s senior management, and they have not determined if the project should continue or not, 
    as the current deliverable may be all they need. What would best describe this review?   
    Ans:Phase Gate
    A phase gate is done at the end of a phase, deciding whether to continue to the next phase or not. 
    A kickoff meeting is generally done at the end of planning and sometimes at the end of the project’s initiated sections 
    in order to start the next section. Answers C and D do not exist.


Question 14:
    What best describes an area of project management where the project manager will work with the project team in order to 
    complete the project work?   
    Ans:“Executing”
    “Executing” is the process group where the project manager acquires both the physical and human resources to complete the project work. 
    The main output of execution is the project deliverables (work). 
    “Initiating” is used to authorize the project, and “planning” is used to determine 
    the course of action needed to build the deliverables. 
    “Closing” is used to review the project and transition the deliverables to the customer or sponsor.


Question 15:
    Project manager Bill has started planning his project and will gather all requirements from his customers, then build the project deliverable in its entirety. Bill will generally not get any input from the customer while the product is being made, and the customer will only review it at the end. What life cycle best describes Bill’s project?     
    Ans:
    A predictive life cycle is when the project scope is known early in the project. For Bill to create the deliverable in its entirety without any feedback from the customer, he will have gathered the scope in its entirety before executing the project. All other choices are adaptive and used in projects when the deliverable is built in increments, with continuous customer feedback.


Question 16:
    Mary has just been awarded a new product development project. After speaking with some of the customers, it seems that they do not know how they would like the product to look and feel. They would like to be more involved in the product development and give Mary continuous feedback. What project life cycle would best fit this project?   
    Ans:
    In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is built in a series of iterations with continuous feedback from project stakeholders. “Predictive” or “waterfall” are the same thing, and are only used when the scope is known early in the project. “Non-predictive” does not exist.


Question 17:
    One phase of the project has been completed, and the stakeholders are very happy with the transition of the project deliverable. 
    What would be the next best step on this project?
    Ans:Phase gate or Phase review
    When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct a phase gate or phase review to 
    determine whether to continue the project or end it. 
    You should not start a phase if you have not reviewed the previously finished phase. 
    Archive project records would have been done in the phase that was just completed. A kickoff meeting is used at the end of 
    planning or when initiating a section of the project in order to start the next section.





Quiz 2: Integration Quiz
---------------------------------------------
Question 1:
A project manager is about to start planning a new sales software development project and will 
work with the project team to create a project management plan. 
What will the project manager and the team not use in planning a project?  
Ans:
Work performance information is an output of monitoring and controlling and is not used during planning. 
The scope statement, scope baseline, and risk register are all created during the planning processes.


Question 2:
The project manager has received a change request from the project sponsor to reduce the budget by 20%. 
After the project manager has reviewed the change, he decides that the only way this can 
be done is by removing a part of the project that is not yet completed. Who should approve this change?   
Ans:
The change control board (CCB) is a group that helps the project manager to assess and deny or approve changes. 
The project team may only help assess the change. “Change approval” and “management board” are made up.


Question 3:
The CEO of a small business has requested that the company’s accounting software be upgraded to better support their financial records. 
He has requested that the software include a report that can forecast the following month’s expenses. 
Where would be the best place the CEO can outline why this project needs to get done?   
Ans:
The business documents contain two parts: the business case and the benefits management plan. 
In this question, the business case would be used to explain why the project would need to get done. 
The “scope outline” is a made-up term. The scope statement and WBS shows the work needed to finish the project.


Question 4:
Project manager Mike worked with the sponsor, Chris, to get the project charter approved for the new office reorganizing project. 
While reviewing the requirements, both Mike and Chris are sure that there is no need to upgrade the office’s current wireless network. 
Where is the best place for Mike and Chis to store this information?   
Ans:
Mike and Chris are making an assumption, as they are sure of their determination but don’t know it for a fact; 
an assumption log is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project. 
A project charter and business case have nothing to do with assumptions. “Assumption documentation” is a made-up term.


Question 5:
While working on creating a project management plan, the project manager has brought a group of expert programmers 
and a planner to ensure it is created correctly. What tool best describes this approach?   
Ans:
The tool that is being used is a focus group, which is part of data gathering. “Meeting” and “interpersonal 
and team skills” do not involve a focus group. Data analysis is used to analyze data that has already been gathered.


Question 6:
When a project has been executed, what input would best help the project manager determine how to manage changes to the project?   
Ans:
The project management plan contains the change management plan. 
The change management plan will outline how changes are requested, assessed, approved, or disapproved. 
The change control board approves or disapproves changes. The term change control chart is a made-up term.


Question 7:
Company XYZ has been executing a new business development project for the last 4 months. 
A few stakeholders have requested changes to the scope and have gotten them approved. 
When a change is approved, what is the next best step to conduct on a project?   
Ans:
Once a change request has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project 
manager will then execute the change in the direct and manage project work process. 
Approved change request is not an input into the processes of monitor and control project work, validate scope, and close project or phase.


Question 8:
A change control board has informed the project manager that a change request made by stakeholder 
Mark to reduce the project schedule by 2 weeks was rejected. What is the first step the project manager should take?   
Ans:
Once a change has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the change log to reflect the status of the change. 
Asking Mark to reduce his change request by 1 week would need a new change request. 
The change was already rejected, there is no need to get the team involved. 
Resubmitting the change request, without any new changes would result in the same outcome.


Question 9:
The deliverable for the product improvement project has been accepted by the sponsor. 
What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the close project or phase process. 
In that process the project manager will discuss the lessons learned and release or reassign the project team. 
A project manager should never leave a project without formally closing it.


Question 10:
Project team member Josh has learned a new method to program the financial application by reading a book about functions in applications. 
What kind of knowledge is this?   
Ans:
Explicit knowledge is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. 
“Tacit” is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. “Common” and “programming” are not types of knowledge.


Question 11:
While executing a project, the project manager has learned that an IT vendor will delay the delivery 
of the server needed to implement the phone system. This problem will need to be resolved soon. What should the PM do first?   
Ans:
The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the issue log. From there, the PM can get a change 
request to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. 
Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the project management plan.


Question 12:
The project team is currently working on the office move project, and they have completed moving one of the floors to the other building. 
While the work is progressing, what document would be best for the project manager to update?   
Ans:
The work performance data will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done. 
The issue log is only updated when there are issues on the project. 
Change logs are only updated once a change request is filed. “Work logs” is a made-up term.


Question 13:
The project sponsor has been asking the project manager to close the project as soon as possible, 
since the deliverable has been created. The project manager has informed the sponsor that the project cannot close yet. 
What best explains why the project manager cannot close the project?   
Ans:
In order for the project or phase to be closed, the deliverable has to be accepted. 
An accepted deliverable is a key input to the process of close project or phase. 
You will release the project team during the close project or phase. If the deliverable was defective, then it would not be considered done.


Question 14:
A company has plans to improve one their products. They have started to work with Mary to get this 
project authorized by the board of directors. What is the output of this process?   
Ans:
The project charter is used to authorize a project. The project management plan and stakeholder register come after the charter is created. 
The business documents are an input to create project charters.


Question 15:
When creating a project management plan what component will address how to approve changes on a project?   
Ans:
The change management plan is a part of the project management plan that describes how to manage changes on a project. 
That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected. The other choices are made up.


Question 16:
A project team has just completed a major module in a new application. 
They were able to complete it in about half the time that was approved for them using a new method from a recent programmers’ publication. 
What should the project manager do first with this new programming method?   
Ans:
Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the lesson learned register. 
This will ensure that the knowledge is saved and can be used throughout the project, as well as on future projects. 
Updating the plan or sponsor will not update the lesson learned register or document the method. 
You cannot close a project or phase if it had not been completed and accepted.


Question 17:
While executing a large project for building a bridge, the PM has received a request that would affect the structure 
of the bridge and may need it to be completely redesigned. The change came from the local transportation department. 
What should the PM do next?   
Ans:
The first step would be to assess the changes and understand how it would affect the project, which may lead to 
stopping the work and redesigning the bridge. 
You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. 
Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.


Question 18:
A phase of a long software development project has been completed. 
The phase was considered very successful: the team was able to complete the deliverables in about half the time and under budget. 
The deliverables were successfully transferred to the next phase of the project. What should the project manager do next for this phase?   
Ans:
The final report is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project. 
While you can initiate or plan another phase on a project, the question does state “for this phase.” “Update project management plan” 
is not an output of close project or phase.


Question 19:
While monitoring and controlling the project, the project manager notices that the project has been 
behind schedule for 2 out of the 3 weeks. The PM thinks it will also be behind schedule this week. 
What kind of data analysis is this?   
Ans:
Trend analysis is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. 
Variance analysis is only used to find a variance, not to predict it. “Prediction analysis” is made up, and expert judgement is 
not part of data analysis.

The WBS dictionary has all details about each work package, such as who is doing it, where it’s getting done, and its cost.


Question 2:
The project manager has met with the company PMO to ask for guidance about creating a scope statement for the project. The PMO had given him all the steps he should follow when creating a scope statement. What document would the project manager best store these steps in?

Ans:
The product scope will outline the product’s features and functionality.


Question 4:
The project manager, Peter, is collecting requirements for the project. He is not sure of the best step to take in order to correctly collect them from the company’s senior management. What document should Peter refer to?   
Ans:
The requirements management plan will outline all the steps the project manager will take to collect, measure, test, and verify requirements.


Question 5:
The project manager, Peter, has met the sponsor, Mary, and has informed her that the project has been delayed due the requirements not being documented correctly. What process was not done correctly during planning?
Ans:
Collect requirements is a process where the requirements are gathered from all stakeholders on the project.


Question 6:
The project team has given the customers access to the new software they created in order to get feedback and see if there is room for improvement. What tool best describes this?   
Ans:
A prototype is used as a tool in the process of collect requirements. It is a working product that is given to users in order to collect feedback and gather their requirements.


Question 7:
The project has conducted a brainstorming session and generated a lot of ideas for their new financial software. The project manager notices that the ideas seem to be in no particular order and would like them to be grouped together. What tool or technique would best help the team?   
Ans:
An affinity diagram is used to group and review ideas.


Question 8:
The project manager has spoken with the customers about what quality requirements there are looking for on the office renovation project. They have specifically said they want to use good quality materials with high durability. Where would be best for the project manager to store this request?   
Ans:
The quality requirements are stored in the requirements documentation, which is an output of collect requirements.


Question 9:
The company has started to work on a new accounting software that would allow the company to better manage their expenses. After they have created the scope statement, they then start to learn more about each deliverable and the efforts needed to produce them. What process best describes this?   
Ans:
“Create WBS” is generally done after the scope statement is created and decomposes the deliverables into work packages.


Question 10:
The project team has completed the deliverables for the project and has checked them to ensure all quality requirements have been met. They have informed the sponsor to review the deliverable with them in order to gain a sign-off on its completion. What tool would be best used in this process?   
Ans:
Inspection is the tool used in the process of validate scope by the stakeholders to formally accept the verified deliverables.


Question 11:
The project manager has noticed that a member of the project team has been doing work that was not in the WBS. When asked why he was doing so, the team member says the sponsor requested the work and he felt he needed it to be done. What process most accurately describes this scenario?   
Ans:
The control scope process is where the project manager compares the planned work to the actual work to ensure there is no variance. If there is a variance a change request might be needed to correct it.




Question 12:
The team is getting ready to break down the deliverables on the scope statement. They are not sure how to conduct this process. What document would best help them?   



Question 13:
The customers of a new office renovation project are not too sure what the project will and will not do. The planning for the project has been completed and it’s now about to be executed. Where can the customers look to see what work the project will not be doing?   
Ans:
The scope statement lists exclusions, or work the project will not be doing.

Ans:
Job shadowing is an example of the observation/conversation part of interpersonal and team skills.


Question 15:
A project team has completed a new smartphone for a major phone manufacturer. During testing they compared their boot time to a few other smartphones made by other companies and realized their phone is very slow by comparison. What could the project team have used to ensure this was addressed during planning?
Ans:
Benchmarking is used on projects to compare its performance or specifications to other projects or industry standards.


Question 16:
While working on a project, the team has encountered many change requests from the customers and sponsor. The project manager has informed the team that the requirements were not collected in detail from the start of the project. What would be the first action the PM and team could take?    
Ans:
The first action the team should take is to identify what was done during the planning processes to gain a better understanding of what went wrong. Then they can redo the process of collect requirements if needed and update the project management plan with the correct requirements.


Question 17:
The project team has completed the new security alarm system for the building and has informed the project manager. The project manager inspected it and verified that it works according to all building and safety regulations. What would be the next process the project manager should conduct?   
Ans:
Since the work has been completed and the project manager has checked the deliverable to ensure it meets the quality requirements, the next process would be to get the sponsors or customers to give a formal acceptance in the validate scope process before closing the project or phase.


Question 18:
During a major construction project of a large building the project manager realizes that the scope didn’t include a new safety regulation. If the building is completed and doesn’t include the regulation the building will not be approved for occupancy. What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
The first action the project manager should take is to analyze how the regulation will affect the project. From there, the project manager might have to get a change request to modify the project management plan to incorporate the regulation.





The best solution here would be to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements in detail. This can include scheduling meetings ahead of time. The project manager should not write the requirements or write a scope statement with just a few of the project requirements. The project has been approved and should not be stopped.
Question 19:
The project manager is having a difficult time collecting requirements from the stakeholders. They never seem to have time to meet with the project manager. What should the project manager do in this situation?

Write the requirements himself
Continue to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements
Create the scope statement from the requirements that have already been collected
Stop the project until they have time to give the requirements


The scope is missing one component, the WBS dictionary. Mary should create it and add it to the scope statement and WBS. The scope baseline is made up of 3 components, the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary.
Question 20:
The project manager, Mary, has completed the scope statement and the WBS for a small project. She has approached the sponsor about gaining approval for the scope baseline. Upon inspection, the sponsor decided the scope baseline doesn’t have enough information in it. What is the best action Mary can take?

Work with the team and create a WBS dictionary
Go back to the collect requirements processes to ensure all requirements were added to the scope baseline
Ask the sponsor to write the scope
Work with the team to create a project schedule and cost baseline
