Question 1
A major portion of a large construction development project was completed by a contractor. 
The contractor has completed all the work listed in the agreement but also completed other work the contractor felt had to be done. 
The contractor is asking for more money that was not listed in the agreement, and the project manager 
feels that what they’re asking for is too much for the additional work that was completed. What should the project manager do next?     

    Tell the contractor they should not have done additional work   
    Inform the contractor that the project does not have the additional funds to cover the work   
    Contact claims administration   (    Correct answer)
    Inform the sponsor   

Overall explanation:
    When there is a dispute between a buyer and a seller for additional funds, the dispute should be resolved 
    by going to the claims administration, who can then facilitate the dispute. 
    The other choices will not resolve the dispute between the buyer and the seller.



Question 2
The project has managed to build about half of the deliverables needed to complete the project. 
The project has spent $50,000 on materials and labor. 
This money that has already been spent is generally referred to as what?   

    *Sunk cost   
    Project budget   
    Opportunity cost   
    Spent cost   

Overall explanation:
    Sunk cost is the money that has already been spent on the project. 
    The project budget includes the cost baseline and the management reserves. 
    Opportunity cost is the cost of all lost opportunities when selecting a project. Spent cost is a made-up term.


Question 3
    The project team has finished 60% of the deliverables when management informs the project manager that the 
    project will be canceled immediately and the team will be reassigned to work on a new project that management feels is more important. 
    What should the project manager do right away?   

    Immediately released the team and start working on the new project   
    Inform management that the project cannot stop because the deliverables are 60% done   
    *Inform the project team, conduct a lesson learned session, and formally release the team from the project   
    Return to planning to understand why the project might have been terminated

OverallExplanation:
If a project is terminated before completion, the project manager should immediately move to the close project 
or phase process and formally close the project. The other choices do not involve the activities in the close project or phase process.


Question 4
The agile project team has completed the Sprint planning meeting. What would be the output of this meeting?

    Product backlog
    User backlog
    Sprint requirements
    *Sprint backlog

Overall explanation:
    The output of the Sprint planning meeting is the Sprint backlog which will outline all work to be done in the next Sprint.



Question 5
As an agile project manager, you have encountered many issues with the product owner. 
The product owner has refused to prioritize the product backlog, stating that all items are equally important. 
After educating the product owner about the value of prioritization, he still refuses. What should the agile project manager do?

    *Continue to educate the product owner
    Prioritize the product backlog for the product owner
    Replace the product owner
    Have the team prioritize the product backlog

Overall explanation:
    One of the core task of being an agile project manager is to educate and promote the values of 
    agile practices even when stakeholders are reluctant to follow those principles.


Question 6
Managing a project can be a very complex task that involves identifying and managing all the stakeholders on the project. 
The project manager spends 90% of their time doing what important task?   

    Determining how long it will take to finish an activity   
    Determining how much an activity will cost   
    Determining the needs of the stakeholders   
    *Communications   

Overall explanation:
    Communications generally take up 90% of the project manager’s time. This generally includes various types of meetings, 
    discussions, negotiation, and problem solving. 
    A project manager does not determine how much an activity will cost or how long it will take; that is generally 
    done by a subject matter expert.


Question 7
While installing the new virtual server, the team discovers a new method that they can use on this project and future 
projects that can get the installation done in about half the time. This new method involves prepping the server image 
and cloning the machines. What is the best project document for the team to update?

    Opportunity register   
    Risk register   
    Your answer is correct
    *Lessons learned register   
    Knowledge management register   

Overall explanation:
    Any time new knowledge is gained on a project, it should be added to the lessons learned register to 
    be used throughout the project and on future projects. The risk register is used to list all the risks that 
    can affect the project and how the project team would respond to them. Opportunity and knowledge management registers are made-up terms.


Question 8
In what process does a project manager determine the approach they will use to involve the stakeholders to meet their expectations?   

    *Plan stakeholders engagement   
    Your answer is incorrect
    Manage stakeholders engagements   
    Plan communications   
    Identify stakeholders   

Overall explanation:
    During the process of plan stakeholder engagement, the project manager will develop an approach to 
    involve the stakeholders to meet their expectations, interest, and potential impact on the project. 
    Identify stakeholders is establishing who the stakeholders are on the project and what their interests will be. 
    Plan communications is to create a plan to ensure that all stakeholders are receiving the correct communications. 
    Manage stakeholder engagement is done to communicate with the stakeholders to meet their needs.


Question 9
Project manager Mark is currently working on a new office automation project and is consistently being asked 
for updates and meetings with the project sponsor. Mark informs the sponsor that the constant meetings disrupt his work, 
and his project is starting to fall behind schedule. The sponsor responds by saying that that is his management style. 
What best describes the sponsor’s management style?   

    Maslow’s hierarchy of needs   
    *Theory X   
    Theory Y   
    Theory Z   

Overall explanation:
Theory X is a management theory in which the manager does not trust his or her workers and will micromanage them. 
This theory generally leads to the team being unhappy. Theory Y refers to when a manager believes people want to do the 
work and trusts them. Theory Z refers to when employees are committed to a business and will generally 
stay with that business for a long period of time. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs specifies what a company must 
have in order for employees to stay motivated.


Question 10
The project manager has just spoken to one of the software developers, Bill, about the project and has asked for an 
estimate of how long it will take to code a specific function. Bill said that it would take a maximum of 10 days, 
but that most likely it will be 6 days. The project manager has calculated the PERT estimated duration of this activity 
to be 6 days. What is the least amount of days it will take to complete this activity?

    4
    1
    3
    *2

Overall explanation:
In this question, you have to use the PERT formula, which is (O+4*R+P)/6 to find the optimistic number. 
The question gives you the answer to the formula—6 days—and you will need to figure out the other components. 
In the question, the pessimistic number given is 10, the realistic number is 6, and you have to find the optimistic number. 
Plug the numbers into the formula like this:  (O+4*6+10)/6=6. Based on this equation, O = 2.



Question 11
The agile project team has decided to do one of the features from the product backlog. 
The single feature will take six weeks to complete and will be reviewed by the customer. 
What actions should the agile project manager take next?

    Arrange the workspace for the team members to get started
    *Informed the team six weeks is too long and they will need to decomposed that feature into smaller increments
    Inform the customers of the six weeks duration
    Inform the team they need to conduct the daily standup meetings

Overall explanation:
    In agile, iterations should be no more than one to four weeks. Features that take longer than should be decomposed into smaller 
    features that can be completed within one to four weeks.



Question 12
The project manager and team have decided to hire a contractor to complete building out the remaining section of the datacenter. 
They have the requirements listed in detail and would like to use a contract that would present the smallest amount of risk to the project. 
The project team members would like to purchase the materials themselves since there are very familiar with the work. 
What contract is best for this project?   


    *Cost plus fixed fee
    Time and materials   
    Your answer is incorrect
    Cost plus contractor fee   
    Cost plus project fee   

Overall explanation:
    A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is where the buyer pays all the work expenses and then pays a fixed price for the work. 
    A time and materials contract is where the buyer pays all the work expenses and then pays the sellers for the 
    time they spent doing the work, and this contract has the highest risk to the buyers. All other choices are made-up terms.


Question 13
A team member is working on upgrading the network server while another team member is painting the server room. 
The outcomes of these two events will not affect each other. What best describes the relationship between these two events?   

    They are mutually exclusiv
    *There are statistically independent
    They are not statistically independent
    They are statistically insignificant

Overall explanation:
    Statistical independence is a term used in probability that means one event cannot affect the other event. 
    Mutually exclusive is a term used when two events cannot happen at the same time; in this question, 
    these two events are happening at the same time.


Question 14
A project manager is having difficulties communicating with the project team; there always seem to be misunderstandings and conflicts. 
What interpersonal and team skills should the project manager improve on?   

    Selective listening   
    Passive listening   
    Lessons learned register
    *Active listening   

Overall explanation:
    Active listening helps to reduce misunderstandings and improves communications and knowledge sharing. 
    Selective listening and passive listening are not terms used in PMBOK. The lessons learned register is not an 
    interpersonal and team skills tool.

Question 15
The project manager is having a very difficult time collecting the requirements from the customers. 
The customers are having a difficult time putting the requirements into logical groupings. 
What tool can best help them group the requirements?   

    *Affinity Diagram   
    Decomposition   
    Prototype   
    Requirements Documentation   

Overall explanation:
    An affinity diagram is used to group large numbers of ideas to be analyzed. A prototype is a functional model 
    of a product given to customers for their feedback. Decomposition is a tool used to break work down into more detailed activities. 
    The requirements documentation would be the output of the process of collect requirements, not a tool.


Question 16
The project manager has been informed that the cost of building a new room in the office will be $15,000, +/- 65%. 
The project manager wants to know why there is such a large variance in the estimate. 
The builder said they have not seen the space and it’s just a high-level estimate. 
What kind of estimate does this best represent?   

    Materials estimate   
    Detail estimate   
    Your answer is correct
    *Rough order of magnitude estimate   
    Definitive estimate     

Overall explanation:
    A rough order of magnitude estimate has a variance of -25% to +75%. It is usually done in the early phases of the project. 
    Definitive estimates are between -5% to +10%. Detail estimate and materials estimate are made-up terms.


Question 17
The team is concerned with the quality of the product about to be created by the project. 
What statement about quality management is true?

    Inspection leads to less prevention   
    High-grade, low quality is okay
    *Low-grade, high quality is okay
    Low-grade, low quality is okay

Overall explanation:
    A low-grade, high-quality project is acceptable. The grade just represents the number of features a project had. 
    Low quality is never okay. Prevention leads to less inspection.


Question 18
While working on an agile project, the project manager met with the project team members to discuss what they did the 
day before and what they plan to do today. What is the name of this meeting?   

    Sprint review meeting   
    *Daily stand-up meeting     
    Sprint planning meeting   
    Project review meeting 

Overall explanation:
    A daily stand-up meeting is done on a daily basis to answer 3 questions:
    What have you done since yesterday?
    What will you do today?
    Are there any roadblocks?
    A sprint planning meeting is done to determine what work will be done in a sprint. 
    A sprint review is where the customers review the work that was done in the sprint. There is no such meeting as a project review meeting.


Question 19
Which of the following is an XP practice that helps to create a shared vision between the developers and the customers?
    Iteration review meeting
    Retrospectives
    *Metaphors
    Daily standup meetings

Overall explanation:
    A metaphor is using XP to explain designs and create a shared vision between customers and the development team.


Question 20
While monitoring and controlling a project, the project manager has been comparing the work 
performance data to the project management plan to see if there is any variance. 
What process did the project manager finish to get the work performance data?   

    Monitor and control project work   
    *Direct and manage project work   
    Develop project management plan   
    Control Scope   

Overall explanation:
    Work performance data is an output of the integration process of direct and manage project work.


Question 21
A project has completed 60% of all the work. The team has spent 55% of the project budget. 
The budget is currently set at $180,000. The sponsor has requested the project’s CPI. What CPI figure should the project manager provide?   


    *1.1   
    $18,000   
    .99   
    $108,000   

Overall explanation:
    CPI is equal to EV/AC. To find the CPI, you must first find EV and AC. EV is equal to the percentage of 
    actual work completed x BAC (budget at completion), which is 60% x $180,000 = $108,000. AC (actual cost) 
    is just the amount of money already spent on the project, which is 55% x $180,000 = $99,000. So, CPI is $108,000/$90,000 = 1.1.


Question 22
The project manager and the project team are reviewing the completed deliverables to 
see if they meet the performance requirements outlined in the requirements documentation. 
This is done so that when the customers are invited to inspect the deliverable, there will be no issues. 
What is the best output of this process?   

    Project management plan   
    Requirements documentation   
    *Verified deliverables   
    Accepted deliverables   

Overall explanation:
    The process of quality control is when the deliverables are inspected to see if they meet the quality requirements. 
    The output of this process is verified deliverables. Control quality is generally done before the process of validate scope, 
    where the deliverables will be inspected by the customers for a formal acceptance. 
    The project management plan, accepted deliverables, and requirements documentation are not outputs of the control quality process.


Question 23
While working on a project, the CEO of the company has informed you that he would like to terminate the 
project and have you work on a few other projects. What kind of influence does this best represent?   


    *Upwards   
    Sideways   
    Downwards   
    Outwards   

Overall explanation:
    Upwards influence is for stakeholders above you such as senior management. 
    Downward influence is for those below you such as team members. Sideways influence is for those who are your 
    peers such as other project managers. Outwards influence is for those who are external, such as vendors.


Question 24
The project manager has to present a risk assessment to senior management and has decided to take the most graphical 
representation of the probability and impact assessment. What tool should the project manager use?   

    *Bubble chart   
    Risk register   
    Pareto chart   
    Risk summary chart   

Overall explanation:
    Bubble charts are tools in the perform quantitative risk analysis process and can show the probability, 
    impact, and ranking of risk. The risk register is not graphical. Pareto charts are used for quality, not risk. 
    Risk summary charts is a made-up term.


Question 25
A project manager wants to ensure that the new cell phone the project is creating will beat or match the 
performance of new cell projects by other companies. What tool would be the best for the project?   

    Plan quality management
    Collect requirements   
    Meetings   
    *Benchmark   

Overall explanation:
    Benchmarking is a tool in plan quality that is used to compare best practices to other projects, 
    either within or outside of the organization. Plan quality is a process, not a tool. 
    Meetings are tools used by the project manager to interact with the project team and solve problems. 
    Collecting requirements is a process, not a tool.


Question 26
The project manager is having a difficult time keeping the project on plan. 
There are many changes regarding the project scope, which has led to an increase in the project budget. 
Management would like a reason why there have been so many scope changes on this project. 
What would most likely cause many scope changes on a project?   


    *Did not gather detailed requirements.   
    The project manager does not have enough training.   
    Management did not approve the project.   
    Spent too long creating the project schedule and not enough time on the scope.   

Overall explanation:
    Generally, if a project manager finds themselves with many scope changes when the project is executed, 
    it’s most likely that they did not gather the requirements adequately from the customers. 
    The other choices cannot be selected because the question does not give enough information regarding them.


Question 27
Your company has just started a project to allow remote workers to join the network using a virtual private network (VPN). 
During the execution of the project, one of the VPN servers completely fails, and the team will need to 
replace it as soon as possible. Fortunately, the project team anticipated that this might happen and has a 
plan for replacing the server. What should the project manager do next?   

    Correct answer
    *Implement risk response   
    Plan risk response   
    Perform qualitative risk analysis   
    Conduct risk response   

Overall explanation:
    Implement risk response is a process in the executing process group, where the project manager 
    implements the preplanned responses to any risks that may have taken place. 
    Plan risk responses is done to determine the team’s response if a risk happens, perform qualitative 
    risk analysis is used to rank risks, and conduct risk response is not a PMBOK process.


Question 28
Mark is currently working on the workstation upgrade project. 
He has noticed there are three activities on the critical path, which are activity A, C, and D. 
Activity B has a slack of 2 and a duration of 4 days. Activity C has a duration of 3 days, and activity D has a duration of 6 days. 
What is the slack on activity A?   

    4 days   
    Cannot be determined   
    2 days   
    Correct answer
    *0 days   

Overall explanation:
    Activities on a critical path have zero slack. The question is trying to mislead you into drawing a 
    network diagram that is not needed to determine the slack.


Question 29
While working on the network upgrade project, the project manager receives many ideas about what to include in the project. 
The ideas seem to be very scattered and not logically grouped. What tool can best help the project manager group these ideas?

    Histograms   
    Flowchart    
    Ideas Matrix   
    Correct answer
    *Affinity diagrams   

Overall explanation:
    An affinity diagram is used to group a large number of ideas to review and analyze. 
    A histogram is used to show frequencies over time. A flowchart is used to visually view a process for improvements. 
    An ideas matrix is a made-up term.


Question 30
What is the difference between the product backlog and the iteration backlog?

    The product backlog contains all work needed to be completed on the project, and the iteration backlog will contain 
    the steps needed to complete the work

    The product backlog and the iteration backlog will outline the steps needed to manage the product and iteration'

    *The product backlog contains all work needed to be completed on the project, and the iteration backlog will contain 
    all work that will get done in the next iteration

    The product backlog contains the work that the project team will do in the next iteration, and the iteration backlog 
    will contain all the steps needed to complete the work

Overall explanation:
    The product backlog will contain all the work needed to complete the project, while the iteration backlog 
    will contain the work that will get done in the next iteration.



Question 31
While working on a web design project, the change control board approved a change to the layout of the menu. 
What process should the project manager conduct next to ensure the change is implemented?   

    Verify scope   
    Update change log   
    Update project management plan   
    Correct answer
    *Direct and manage project work   

Overall explanation:
Once a change has been approved, it is then moved to the direct and manage project work process for implementation. 
Verify scope is done when all the deliverables are completed and require stakeholders’ acceptance. 
Update project management plan and change log are not processes.


Question 32
A large development company has just initiated a project to build a 60-story building. 
The project will take approximately 3 years to complete with a cost of $550 million. 
The development company has started to facilitate funding for the project by asking private equity firms and banks. 
What tools does this best represent?

    Analogous estimates   
    *Financing   
    Funding limit reconciliation   
    Parametric estimates   

Overall explanation:
    Financing is a tool used in the process of determine budget. This is when a company looks at external sources to fund the project. 
    Funding limit reconciliation is done when there are limited funds to spend on the project and work may need to be rescheduled. 
    Parametric estimates are a type of mathematical estimates done to estimate the cost of each activity. 
    Analogous estimates are based on historical information to estimate the cost of each activity.


Question 33
The project manager has noticed that a few team members are having a difficult time following the inspection process 
to check the quality of new software. What is the best tool to help them see the process, making it easier to follow?

    *Flowchart   
    Control Chart   
    Histogram
    Process design chart   

Overall explanation:
A flowchart is used to visually follow the steps in a process or multiple processes. 
A control chart will show if a process is in “control” by illustrating the rule of 7. 
A histogram is a bar chart that usually shows frequency of something. A process design chart is a made-up term.


Question 34
The project team is having a very difficult time deciding what method they should use 
when programming the new functions in the application. 
They can choose between four different methods, and the team is evenly split regarding which method to choose. 
The project manager has decided that he will choose the method for them and will take the responsibility in 
case it is not the best way to program functions. What best describes this technique?   

    Leadership   
    Correct answer
    *Autocratic   
    Voting   
    Multi-criteria decision   

Overall explanation:
    In autocratic decision making, an individual makes the decision for the team and takes responsibility for the decision. 
    Voting is when the team votes on a potential decision, and multi-criteria decision is when different 
    criteria are used to evaluate a decision. Leadership refers to skills for managing the team.


Question 35
The project manager is currently working on a large building renovation project. 
The project team is almost done with planning when the project sponsor informs the project manager that due to new regulations, 
the project will need to be completed within 6 months; if not, 
they will not be able to open the building to the public. What best represents this?   

Work packages   
Assumptions   
Correct answer
*Constraints   
Deliverables   

Overall explanation:
    A constraint is something that limits a project, which can include time or cost. 
    In this question, the constraint is a limitation on the time available to get the project done. 
    Deliverables, assumptions, and work packages are not constraints on a project.


Question 36

    Network diagram   
    *Milestone chart   
    WBS   
    Gantt chart   

Overall explanation:
    A milestone chart is a high-level view of major accomplishments on a project. 
    These are best used when presenting a quick view of data and the project schedule to management personnel. 
    All other choices would give you a detailed view of the project schedule and work.



Question 38
Project manager Mark is working to create the project scope statement for a sales management software. 
Many stakeholders have requested that a feature be added to enable automated call-backs to leads that come through the website. 
Mark realizes that adding this feature will not be possible due to the fact that the company’s 
current network lacks the required hardware. What is the best approach for Mark to take?   


    Tell the stakeholders to submit a change request   
    Tell the stakeholders the feature will be added after the project is done   
    *Adds the feature as an exclusion to the scope statement   
    Add the feature and hope the sponsor approves the budget   

Overall explanation:
A project scope statement not only contains the project’s deliverables but also the exclusions, 
which are features the project will not accomplish. Mark should not add the feature due to the company’s inability to install it.

Question 39
While working on a large multinational project, you identify some of the positive and negative stakeholders. 
What process group are you currently engaged in?

Correct answer
Initiating   

Communications management   

Your answer is incorrect
Stakeholder management

Overall explanation
The process of identifying stakeholders is part of the initiating process group.
Question 40
Correct
The datacenter redesign project has been executed and is currently 50% complete. One of the project’s key stakeholders has submitted a change request to change the building’s wiring from copper cables to fiber cables. The project manager has contacted a wiring contractor, who said it will take about 2 months to install the fiber at a cost of $2 million. What should the project manager do next?

Deny the change due to the schedule   

Update the project management plan   

Your answer is correct
Submit the change to change control board   

Deny the change due to the high cost   

Overall explanation
Once a change has been assessed, the next step would be to get the change approved or rejected by the change control board. The project manager should not approve or deny changes without a response from the change control board. Once a change is approved, you can update the project management plan.

Question 41
Incorrect
The project manager has met with the project team and has informed them that his team performance assessments are done, and he would like to speak with each of them individually about the results. What process group is this?

Initiating

Question 43
Incorrect
The project manager and team are currently working to create a list of activities needed to complete the project. They have come to one particular work package that they cannot decompose because they do not know enough about the work yet. They have decided that midway through the project, they will decompose this particular work package. What tool or technique are they using?   

Your answer is incorrect
Decomposition   

Forward Planning   

Requirements Future Planning   

Correct answer
Rolling Wave Planning   

Overall explanation
Rolling wave planning is a tool used in the process of define activities to break work down in the future. Forward planning and requirements future planning are not real tools used in the process of define activities. Decomposition is a tool used to break down the current activities.
Question 44
Correct
The project team is working with the customers to write the user stories. The customers have refused as they claim this would add no value to the project. What would be the best step to resolve this?

Inform them user stories may not be needed

Your answer is correct
Educate the users why the user stories are valuable

Ask the agile project manager to write the user stories

Have the team write the user stories

Overall explanation
When managing an agile project, user stories will produce a lot of value to both the team members and the customers, as such it would be best to educate them on the value of the user stories.

Question 45
Correct
After the project manager has collected the requirements and received approval for the scope statement, what process should the project manager do next?

Create scope baseline   

Your answer is correct
Create WBS   

Sequence activities   

Define activities   

Overall explanation
The create WBS process is generally done after the scope statement has been created, as it will decompose the deliverables in the scope statement. You cannot define activities or sequence activities until the WBS is complete, as you will need to know work packages to create the activities. Create scope baseline is a made-up term.
Question 46
Incorrect
A project manager decided to assign each team member on a project to no more than one activity at a time. This way, the team doesn’t get burned out and can work at a steady pace. The schedule may increase due to this policy, which is okay with the sponsor. What technique best describes this action?   

Correct answer
Resource leveling   

Your answer is incorrect
Resource equalization   

Resource movement   

Resource crashing   

Overall explanation
Resource leveling is done when resources on a project are over-allocated; it removes resources that are working on two activities at the same time.
Question 47
Incorrect
The project manager and sponsor are consulting with banks and other lending institutions in order to obtain funds for the project. What process describes these actions?     

Determine project financing   

Correct answer
Determine budget   

Your answer is incorrect
Plan cost management   

Develop project charter   

Overall explanation
The determine budget process is where the tool of financing is used to seek funding for the project. Develop project charter is used to get the project authorized. Plan cost management is used to create the cost management plan. Determine project financing is a made-up process.

Question 48
Incorrect
While conducting procurement on a project, the project manager has received many different bids with a wide variance of estimated cost for the work. What can the project manager use to best determine which vendor has given a realistic price?

Your answer is incorrect
Inspection and audits   

Screening system   

Weighing system   

Correct answer
Independent estimate   

Overall explanation
An independent estimate is usually done by an outside entity to help give the project manager a more independent understanding of what certain project work will cost. Inspections and audits are done after the seller is selected to ensure the work stays on contract. Screening and weighing systems are done to help select sellers.
Question 49
Correct
The project manager is currently analyzing the requirements for the project. He has been informed that the stakeholders will be very disappointed if there are defects in the deliverables. He decides to ensure that the project team receives the right training and the best equipment available to build the deliverables correctly. This will in turn increase the overall cost of the project, but stakeholders do not mind the increase in cost. What best describes this increase in cost?   

Your answer is correct
Cost of quality   

Cost of the requirements   

Activities cost   

Expert judgement   

Overall explanation
The cost of quality includes the cost of conformance, which includes funds spent to ensure the project meets the quality requirements. This generally includes the cost of better materials, more expert team members, and better equipment. Cost of resource requirements and activity costs are not valid elements. Expert judgement involves hiring subject matter experts to help plan a particular process.
Question 50
Correct
While working on a network upgrade project, a team member installed the network connection and is now configuring the router in order to work with the network connection. The network connection must be done before the router can be configured. This is an example of what kind of dependency?   

Your answer is correct
Mandatory dependency   

Internal dependency   

Discretionary dependency   

External dependency   

Overall explanation
Mandatory dependency is when activities must be done in a certain order. For example, you must complete A then complete B. Internal dependencies are things that are under the control of the project team, and external dependencies are things that are outside the control of the project team, such as getting a permit. Discretionary dependency is when two activities can be done in any order and they’re not dependent upon each other.
Question 51
Correct
While monitoring the status of an agile project, what numerical analysis can the project team use to help determine if the project is on schedule?

Your answer is correct
Earned value management

Net present value

Return on investment

Scheduling management values

Overall explanation
Earned value management is a series of formulas that monitor the value of the project as it’s progressing and generally track cost and schedule.

Question 52
Incorrect
While attempting to determine the schedule for the project, the project manager has been informed from the team that each line of code will take about 15-45 minutes to write and debug. There will be about 1 million lines of code in the application. What schedule-estimating technique best describes this estimate?   

Analogous   

Your answer is incorrect
Bottom-up   

Correct answer
Parametric   

Top-down   

Overall explanation
Parametric estimates are based on a data set such as cost per feet or time per task. Top-down and analogous are the same and are high-level estimates based on historical data. Bottom-up involves breaking down the work and then adding it back up.

Question 53
Incorrect
During the datacenter development project, the project manager has noticed that some of the work being done on the project is not in the baseline scope. The project manager has analyzed the work completed by the project team and then compared that to the project management plan to see where the differences are. What process best describes the work of the project manager?   

Manage scope   

Correct answer
Control scope   

Monitor scope   

Your answer is incorrect
Validate scope   

Overall explanation
Control scope is a process where you compare the work that has been completed to the project management plan to see if they line up. If there is a variance, the project manager should initiate actions to fix the variance. Validate scope is a process where stakeholders formally accept the project deliverables. Monitor and manage scope are made-up processes.
Question 54
Correct
When an organization is considering a project, what are some of the factors that can influence why a project should get done?

Hiring new personnel   

Continuing the day-to-day work in a particular department

Making the company shareholders happy   

Your answer is correct
Meeting regulatory, legal, or social requirements   

Overall explanation
Reasons a project should get done include meeting regulatory, legal, or social requirements, satisfying stakeholders’ needs, and implementing business changes. The other choices pertain to operational work, which is more day-to-day and ongoing.
Question 55
Correct
Senior management would like your project to have as few risks as possible. Which of the following contracts best meets their criteria?

Cost plus fixed fee   

Cost reimbursable   

Time and material   

Your answer is correct
Fixed price   

Overall explanation
A fixed price contract will have the lowest risk for the project, since the costs of the labor and material are known up front. All other contracts, such as cost reimbursable and time and material will have more risks for the buyers than the sellers. A cost plus fixed fee contract is a type of cost reimbursable contract.
Question 56
Incorrect
Senior management has requested an update to the current product upgrade project. The project manager knows she has to keep the information high-level, and as short as possible. Which resource would be the best to show senior management?   

Project schedule network diagram   

Correct answer
Milestone chart   

Your answer is incorrect
WBS dictionary   

WBS   

Overall explanation
A milestone chart shows only the timeframes of the major deliverables. All other choices such as the WBS, WBS dictionary, and the network diagram are very detailed.

Question 57
Correct
The work the project will contain and the velocity of the team is currently at 14 points. What is the total size of the project in terms of story points?

150

110

Your answer is correct

Overall explanation
Total size of the project will be 10 iterations x 14 points = 140 Points.

Question 58
Incorrect
During a new smartphone development project, the customers are given a prototype of the product for them to demo. They inform you that the phone constantly reboots, and sometimes the touch screen does not work. What tool can the project team use to find the reasons for these defects?   

Inspections   

Correct answer
Ishikawa diagram   

Your answer is incorrect
Assumptions analysis   

Histograms   

Overall explanation
An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a cause-and-effect diagram, is used to list the many different probabilities for a project’s defect. Assumptions analysis involves analyzing assumptions, histograms are used to show the frequency of defects, and inspections are used to see if a deliverable has met its requirements.
Question 59
Incorrect
While planning the risk responses for a construction project, the project manager and project team have decided they will have to choose a new electrical contractor due to the fact that the recommended contractor has legal issues with the local building department. The legal issues could cause the project to be delayed. What risk response does this represent?   

Your answer is incorrect
Accept

Mitigate   

Exploit   

Correct answer
Avoid   

Overall explanation
Avoidance is when you go down a different path all together. The risk is eliminated and cannot happen. Since they chose another contractor, they cannot get delayed by that particular contractor. Acceptance is taking no action against the risk and accepting the outcome. Mitigation is done to reduce the risk probability and/or impact. Exploit is for a positive risk that will ensure the risk takes place.

Question 60
Correct
While working on a project, you realize that you will not be able to install the server and the workstations at the same time. In fact, the team has alerted you that after the server installation is done, you should wait an additional 4 days before installing the workstations. This is due to the updates the server will need, which is an automated process. What do you need to add to the schedule in order to account for this delay?   

Slack   

Your answer is correct
Lag   

Lead   

Float   

Overall explanation
A lag is a delay between activities. A lead is an overlap between activities. Slack and floats refer to the same thing: the amount of time you can delay an activity without delaying the project.
Question 61
Correct
The project was executed about 3 weeks ago, and the project team seems to be having a lot of difficulties getting along with each other. They are always having conflicts about how to proceed on certain activities, and the project manager has to step in in order to solve these conflicts. What process is the project manager performing?   

Your answer is correct
Manage Team   

Acquire Team   

Control Scope   

Control Resources   

Overall explanation
In the process of manage team, the project manager has to resolve issues and conflicts among the project team. This is done using the tool interpersonal and team skills, particularly conflict management. Acquire team is not a process in the PMBOK. Control resources is a process that involves physical resources, not human resources. Control scope is about preventing scope creep and ensuring the project meets the scope.
Question 62
Correct
While compiling all the work performance information into the work performance report, a project manager notices that the SPI of the project is .6 and the CPI is .7. What action should the project manager take next on this project?   

Inform the sponsor the project is over budget.   

None since the project is on the budget and ahead of schedule.   

Inform the sponsor of a major delay.   

Your answer is correct
Create a change request to correct the project.   

Overall explanation
In this scenario, an SPI of .6 and a CPI of .7 indicate that the project is behind schedule and over budget. The project manager should initiate change requests to correct the budget and schedule of the project. Informing the sponsor of only a delay or being over budget is just half of what’s wrong with the project.
Question 63
Incorrect
One of the customers would like to add a new component to the project that would likely increase the functionality of the software. What steps should the customer take when adding this new component on an Agile project?

Ask the agile project manager for permission to add it to the product backlog

Correct answer
Add it to the product backlog

Your answer is incorrect
Fill out a change request form

Changes are not allowed on agile projects

Overall explanation
When a customer would like to add a change to an agile project, they simply added to the product backlog. That new feature will then be prioritized based on its value in the product backlog.

Question 64
Correct
The project manager is working on a project for which the scope, time, and cost are known during the early parts of the project planning. What life cycle will the project manager consider on this project?   

PMBOK life cycle   

Your answer is correct
Predictive life cycle   

Straightforward life cycle   

Iterative life cycle   

Overall explanation
A predictive life cycle is used when the scope, time, and cost are mostly determined in the early phases of the project. In this life cycle, changes to the scope must be managed correctly; if not, there may be scope creep. In an iterative life cycle, the scope is generally known in the early parts of the project, but the cost is updated as the project progresses.

Question 65
Incorrect
The project team has just started to code a redesigned accounting application when a key stakeholder asks for the application to include a very specific report on the company’s expenses. The stakeholder has submitted a change request to the project manager. What would be the most important input to consider for this change request?   

Correct answer
Work performance reports   

Your answer is incorrect
Work performance data   

Accepted deliverables   

Work performance information   

Overall explanation
Work performance reports are an input to the process of performing integrated change control, as it will show the overall status of the project. The other choices are not inputs to this process.

Question 66
Incorrect
While working on a complex web design project, the manager has received a change request from a senior stakeholder to fix a problem with the current intranet server. The project manager has determined that this change is outside the scope of the project and is not covered by the work listed in the project charter. What should the project manager do next?   

Correct answer
Inform the stakeholder that this change request should be considered a new project   

Pass the change to change control board   

Your answer is incorrect
Inform the stakeholder that the change will incur a significant cost and time increase   

Ignore the change request   

Overall explanation
Although all change requests should be considered by the project manager, they should be related to the project work. No change should be approved if it is outside the scope of the project charter, since that would not be considered work within the current project.
Question 67
Correct
Over the last three weeks the project team has finally been able to establish a shared vision of what the product would look like when it is complete. This is an example of?

Shared vision

Your answer is correct
Progressive elaboration

Progressive management

Requirements gathering

Overall explanation
Progressive elaboration occurs when more detailed information emerges over time.

Question 68
Incorrect
The project team has completed a bidder conference for the office renovation project. Over 15 different construction companies came to the conference. Directly after the conference, all the companies submitted their bids immediately. What is the next step the project team should take?

Update the scope baseline   

Correct answer
Select the seller   

Rewrite the statement of work   

Your answer is incorrect
Update the agreement   

Overall explanation
A bidder conference is a tool used for conduct procurement, and the output of this process is to select the seller and receive an agreement. Rewriting the scope statement or updating the scope baseline may come after you have selected the seller.
Question 69
Incorrect
After the iteration has completed, where will the team inspect the methods they used to build that increment?

Your answer is incorrect
Iteration review

Iteration backlog

Iteration planning

Correct answer
Retrospective

Overall explanation
A retrospective is done after each iteration so the team can reflect and plan improvements for the next iteration.

Question 70
Correct
While managing a product development project, the project manager met with the team to determine some of the key tasks that will ensure they produce a high-quality product. What should they consider the most important concept in quality?     

High-grade is more important than high-quality

Cost of quality only includes the inspection cost

Your answer is correct
Quality is about prevention

Quality is about more inspection than prevention

Overall explanation
Quality management is about preventing defects from getting into the hands of the customers. It’s more important to have high quality than high grade. More prevention will lead to less inspection. The cost of quality includes all prevention and inspection costs.

Question 71
Correct
A project manager has just taken over an agile project that is about 50% complete. The project manager is currently reviewing the product backlog and notices the requirements are not in an order he understands. How is the product backlog prioritized?

Your answer is correct
By value   

By regulation   

By schedule   

By cost   

Overall explanation
The product backlog is prioritized by the product owner based on value. The requirements with the most value will be at the top of the list and will be completed in the next iteration.
Question 72
Correct
The risk management plan generally outlines the steps the project will take to conduct risk management processes on the project. Which of the following will the risk management plan not include?   

A way to categorize the risks   

The methodology used to manage risks   

Your answer is correct
Positive risks that could affect the project   

Roles and responsibilities for the project team concerning risks processes   

Overall explanation
The risk register lists both positive and negative risks, not the risk management plan. The risk management plan includes the risk breakdown structure that categorizes risks, roles, and responsibilities for the team members and the methodology they would use to perform the risk processes on the project.
Question 73
Incorrect
While developing a new smartphone, the project team has identified a specific set of performance measurements that the phone should meet when it is complete. The measurement looks at how fast the phone can boot up and how fast it can shut down. Where should the project team document these measurements?   

Quality checklist   

Quality management plan   

Your answer is incorrect
Requirements traceability Matrix   

Correct answer
Quality metrics   

Overall explanation
Quality metrics are used to measure the project deliverables. The quality checklist will inform the project team what to look for when inspecting the project deliverables. The quality management plan will outline how to conduct the quality processes such as manage quality and control quality. The requirements traceability matrix will track the requirements back to their origin.
Question 74
Incorrect
The project team has been brought together for the first time to work on a network upgrade project. They were able to learn about the functions they will doing on the project and what their roles will be. What will the team do next, according to Tuckman’s ladder?   

Your answer is incorrect
Forming   

Norming   

Performing   

Correct answer
Storming   

Overall explanation
The team is currently in the forming stage and will move next to the storming stage. The stages are forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning.
Question 75
Correct
The project manager has decided that most of the stakeholders on the project would like to reference the status reports for the project on the company’s internal website on their own time. This would make it easier for them, as it is very difficult to schedule a meeting with all of them at once. What type of communication best describes this?

Technical communication   

Interactive communication   

Push communication   

Your answer is correct
Pull communication   

Overall explanation
Pull communication is done when stakeholders access the communications on their own time, usually through a web portal. Push communication is when communication is given to the stakeholders such as in an email. Interactive is when stakeholders are communicating in real time such as through a phone call. Technical communication is a made-up term.
Question 76
Incorrect
While monitoring a large construction project, the project manager has calculated the SPI of the project to be 1.2. A contractor has informed the project manager that a delivery will be 1 week late. The 1-week delay is 10% of the project schedule. What would mostly likely happen to this project?   

Your answer is incorrect
The project will finish behind schedule   

Correct answer
The project will finish ahead of schedule   

The project will finish over budget   

The project will finish under budget   

Overall explanation
The current SPI is 1.2, which means the project is 20% ahead of schedule. A 10% delay should not cause this project to finish behind schedule. You cannot determine the project’s budget from the information in this question.
Question 77
Incorrect
While working on an agile project, the team receives a request from the customer to deploy the software as soon as the iteration is done. The customer has already checked the completed part of the software and has accepted it. The team has refused to deploy the software. What best explains the team’s refusal?

The iteration has many errors   

Correct answer
The iteration is part of a release   

The iteration took too long   

Your answer is incorrect
The iteration needs to be closed   

Overall explanation
Iterations are part of a product that is inspected by the customers. An iteration may not be something that can be released to users since it only represents a few weeks’ worth of work. A release usually includes multiple iterations that are releasable to the customers. In this question the customer has already accepted the iteration, which means there are no errors in it.
Question 78
Correct
After a project manager is assigned to the project with the project charter, he continues to identify the stakeholders on the project. In this process, he creates the stakeholder register. Which of the following statements about the stakeholder register is false?   

Your answer is correct
It’s only updated in the initiating phase of the project

It classifies the stakeholders

It contains a list of all stakeholders on the project

It’s updated throughout the project

Overall explanation
The stakeholder register is updated throughout the project, not just during the initiation phase of the project. All other choices are true.
Question 79
Correct
While building an agile space, the project manager would like to implement a tool that will allow the team to keep track of the flow of work while limiting the work in progress. What tool best meets these requirements?

Whiteboard

Burndown charts

Your answer is correct

Overall explanation
Kanban development involves the use of a signboard that is used to help track the work in progress and limit the work in progress.

Question 80
Correct
When managing risks on a project, the project manager should be aware of the individual project risks and which other project risks?   

Your answer is correct
Overall project risks   

High-level risks   

High-probability risks   

Group project risks   

Overall explanation
Risk generally falls into two levels on a project: individual project risks and overall project risks. All other terms are not different types of risks.
Question 81
Incorrect
The project sponsors have informed the project manager that they would like to be included in the weekly meetings along with the team members. What should the project manager update to include the sponsors in the weekly meetings?   

Scope management plan   

Risk management plan   

Correct answer
Communication management plan   

Your answer is incorrect
Project communications   

Overall explanation
The communication management plan outlines who will be receiving what type of communications, how often they will receive them, and who will provide them. The project manager should update this plan to specify who will be attending the weekly meetings. The scope and risk management plans do not contain any information about project meetings. Project communications refer to actually communicating on a project.
Question 82
Correct
While managing the stakeholders’ engagement, the project manager notices that some of the team members are not respectful to other team members. This has led to a few conflicts between the members. What can the project manager best do about this?   

Your answer is correct
Implement ground rules   

Stop the project   

Inform the sponsor   

Release the team   

Overall explanation
Ground rules are usually set within the team charter and are the general rules that the team will follow in order to effectively work with each other. These generally include behavioral rules. Before releasing the team, the project manager should try to resolve the problem. Conflicts within a project team should not be a reason to stop a project. If you were to inform the sponsor, they would generally tell you to solve this problem.
Question 83
Incorrect
While working on a project schedule, the project manager notices that activities A, B, and C all have a duration of 4 days. The project manager also notices that activities F and G have a duration of 7 days. Activities A, C, F, and G have a slack of 1 day. Activity B is the only one on the critical path. What is the slack on activity B?   

Cannot be determined   

Your answer is incorrect
1 day   

Correct answer
0 days   

2 days   

Overall explanation
If an activity is on the critical path, it will have zero slack. Non-critical path activities will have a slack of at least 1 day.
Question 84
Incorrect
Team members Mark and Bill are currently experiencing conflict in the office move project. Mark believes that it would be best if they moved the furniture first and then the computers, whereas Bill believes it’s best to move the computers and then the furniture. This conflict is causing a serious delay to the project, and both Mark and Bill have decided they will make a decision on what to move first at a later date. What conflict resolution technique best describes this scenario?

Your answer is incorrect
Accommodating   

Correct answer
Withdrawal   

Compromise   

Postponing   

Overall explanation
The conflict resolution technique Illustrated in this question is withdrawal, which is when they postpone the issue to a later date to be better prepared. Compromise is when the two sides reach an agreement but both sides have to give up something. Postponing is a made-up term.
Question 85
Incorrect
The project sponsor has signed off on the project charter and has spoken to the project manager, who then has to keep the cost down on the project. The project manager agrees to try his best to keep cost down and to finish the project under budget. What should the project manager do next?   

Meet with the team to determine where money can be saved on the project   

Correct answer
Meet with the stakeholders to gather their requirements   

Implement the project cost reduction program   

Your answer is incorrect
Create the WBS   

Overall explanation
Once the project charter is created, the next step would be to collect the requirements and then create the scope statement and the WBS. You cannot meet with the team to reduce cost if you don’t know the requirements. There is no such thing as a cost reduction program in PMBOK.
Question 86
Correct
You’re currently working on a large new building development project. The project team is currently breaking down the deliverables listed in the project scope statement into work that is more manageable. What process best describes this scenario?   

Define activities   

Your answer is correct
Create WBS   

Define WBS   

Define scope   

Overall explanation
During the create WBS process, the project team will use the decomposition tool to break down the project deliverables into work packages. These work packages will then be used to help estimate the time and cost of the project. Define activities is the process of decomposing the work packages into activities, not the deliverables. Define scope is used to create the scope statement which will have a list of the deliverables. Define WBS is not a process.

Question 87
Correct
While working with the project team and conducting a brainstorming session, the project manager noticed that a lot of the ideas the team was coming up with were not organized. What tool can be used by the team to best visually organize their ideas?

Pareto diagram   

Flowchart   

Matrix diagram   

Your answer is correct
Mind mapping   

Overall explanation
Mind mapping is a way to visually organize data. A matrix diagram is used to show the relationship between two or more groups. A flowchart shows a graphical representation of a process. A Pareto diagram displays Pareto’s 80/20 rule, usually in a histogram.

Question 88
Incorrect
Your company has decided to roll out a new Wi-Fi network for the staff. The sponsor has informed you that encryption on the network is mandatory. Where will the project manager document that the encryption was mandated by the sponsor?   

Project scope statement   

Correct answer
Requirements traceability Matrix   

Requirements documentation   

Your answer is incorrect
Scope Baseline   

Overall explanation
The requirements traceability matrix will trace the requirements back to their origins. The project scope statement, scope baseline, and requirements documentation will not include where requirements came from.
Question 89
Incorrect
After many years of following the agile principles the project team has implemented a few new methods in addition to the agile methods in order to increase the efficiency of the project. This will be known as?

Process analysis

Non-agile processes

Process tailoring

Your answer is incorrect
Hybrid processes

Overall explanation
Process tailoring is done to amend the agile methodology to better fit the project environment.

Question 90
Incorrect
The project manager is working on a new electrical wiring upgrade project for the entire office. Due to safety issues, the project manager cannot move forward with many parts of the project without inspections and permits from the local Buildings Department. Most permits take approximately 6 weeks to get. Where would the project manager document the opportunity the project should take if a permit comes within 2 weeks instead of the 6 weeks?

Change request   

Correct answer
Risk register   

Your answer is incorrect
Assumption log   

Issue log   

Overall explanation
This question describes a positive risk, which is known as an opportunity, and this is added to the risk register. The assumption log will only document assumptions that are made on a project, and the issue log will have a list of issues that are currently taking place on a project. A change request is only issued when parts of the project management plan or document must be updated.
Question 91
Incorrect
The project manager is informed that a manager in the finance department has requested to be included in the weekly status updates on the project. What document should the project manager update immediately?   

Your answer is incorrect
Risk register   

Issue log   

Correct answer
Stakeholder register   

Project communications   

Overall explanation
The stakeholder register can be updated at any point during the project. It contains a list of all stakeholders and their contact information, communication requirements, and impact on the project. Once this is done, then the project manager can update the communication management plan to add the new stakeholder. This is a change, not an issue on a project, so there is no need to update the issue log. The risk register keeps track of the risk on the project. Project communications are the actual communications taking place during the project.

Question 92
Correct
What is considered the single most important skill a project manager should have?   

Technology   

Your answer is correct
Communication   

Expert judgment   

Business   

Overall explanation
Effective communication is the single most important skill a project manager should have. Projects are done by people, not technology.

Question 93
Incorrect
You are currently managing a business process reengineering project and have identified all the risks that can affect the project. You would like to put the risks in order from most impact to least impact on the project. What is the best process for doing so?   

Correct answer
Perform qualitative risk analysis   

Your answer is incorrect
Perform quantitative risk analysis   

Rank Risk   

Plan risk response   

Overall explanation
Perform qualitative risk analysis is a process used to rank risks according to probability and/or impact. Perform quantitative analysis is done in order to assign values to the risk. Plan risk response describes the strategies that would be used if a risk were to materialize. Rank risks is not a valid process.
Question 94
Incorrect
There have been many disputes on the project with the current contractor. The contractor claims the project team is always asking that work not be listed in the contract, and the team claims that the contractor has not been doing the work listed in the contract. What should the project manager do first?   

Meet with the project team members to understand why they feel the contractor has not been doing the work in the contract   

Your answer is incorrect
Meet with the contractor to understand why the team continually asks that the work not be listed in the contract   

Correct answer
Review the contract   

Contact claims administration   

Overall explanation
The first step would be to review the contract to ensure he understands what the original agreement was, and then he should meet with the team and contractor. If needed, he should then contact claims administration.

Question 95
Incorrect
The project has just been initiated, and the project sponsor calls the project manager to ask approximately when he thinks the project will be completed. The project manager replies that they have been unable to thoroughly analyze the work needed to complete the project and that he is not very knowledgeable about this kind of work. The sponsor insists on receiving a high-level estimate. The project manager responds that it will take approximately 3 months to complete the work based on his experience working on a project very similar to this one. What technique best represents this estimate?   

Parametric estimates   

Your answer is incorrect
Bottom-up estimates   

Expert judgement   

Correct answer
Analogous estimates   

Overall explanation
Analogous estimation, also known as a top-down estimate, is usually a high-level estimate that is based on previous projects. These estimates are done very quickly, but they’re generally less accurate than others. Bottom-up estimates, parametric estimates, and expert judgments will need a lot more planning and understanding of the work to be completed, but they are considered very accurate.

Question 96
Incorrect
The project manager, Mark, overheard that the project team is not satisfied with the way the budget was created. They strongly believe the project will be over budget at the end. What is the next best step for Mark?   

Ask the sponsor for approval to increase the budget.   

Your answer is incorrect
Do nothing, because the team didn’t speak to Mark about it.   

Correct answer
Bring the team together and attempt to understand why they feel this way.   

Review how the budget was created.   

Overall explanation
A project manager should not take action on issues they overhear without first finding out why stakeholders feel a certain way. This ensures that the project manager has a detailed understanding of the issues.
Question 97
Correct
The project team is currently working on an advertising project. They have completed a few of the activities, which includes writing the script for the commercial. Once the team completes an activity, what should they do next?

Your answer is correct
Update work performance data   

Update project sponsor   

Update the project manager   

Close project or phase   

Overall explanation
Once work is done on a project, the team should update the work performance data. This will include the status on the work, such as when it was completed or started. The project manager will take the work performance data and create the work performance information and report, which will then be given to all the other stakeholders. You should not close the project or phase until all work has been completed and accepted.

Question 98
Incorrect
While working on a new server upgrade project, the project manager calculates the SPI of the project to be 1.3. The project sponsor would like an explanation for why the SPI is that high. What would be the project manager’s best response?   

Your answer is incorrect
The project contained a lot of work that took more time than anticipated and is now completely behind schedule.   

The project had too many critical paths on it this led to a large delay on the project   

The project is currently on schedule due to the level of details that was covered during the planning processes   

Correct answer
The project team were able to finish the work faster than anticipated and this is what led to the project being ahead of schedule   

Overall explanation
An SPI of 1.3 shows that the project is ahead of schedule by 30%. This could be because the project team is finishing the work faster than originally scheduled. The other choices involve the project being either behind schedule or on schedule, but in this situation, the project is ahead of schedule.

Question 99
Incorrect
While working on a project with a budget of $5,000, the project manager determines that the earned value on the project so far is $1,750. So far, the project team has spent $2,900. What should the project manager report as the status of the budget?   

Your answer is incorrect
The project is over budget by 60%.   

The project is under budget by 40%.

Correct answer
The project is over budget by 40%.   

The project is under budget by 60%.   

Overall explanation
In this situation, you would need to find out the CPI of the project, which is EV/AC. That would equal 1750/2900 = .6. A CPI of .6 indicates that the project is 40% over budget. Remember that if the CPI is 1, then the project is on budget. Anything under 1 represents being over budget, and anything over 1 represents being under budget.

Question 100
Incorrect
Which of the following is a method that will be used to conduct frequent verification and validation that can be done every second on the project?

Correct answer
Pair programming

Unit testing

Your answer is incorrect

Communication models   

Encryption   

Overall explanation
Communication technology factors include sensitivity and confidentiality of the information on the project, which will require the project manager to assess the security needs of the project information. Communication models are used when looking at the communication processes. Encryption is not a tool in the PMBOK.
Question 103
Incorrect
During a new workstation rollout project, a stakeholder asked for a change to some of the software being installed. The change was submitted to the Change Control Board but was rejected due to the high increase in cost of the software being requested. What should the project manager do next?      

Update the issue log   

Resubmit the change request for additional consideration   

Your answer is incorrect
Perform additional analysis on the requested change   

Correct answer
Update the change log   

Overall explanation
Once a change has been denied, the next step is to update the change log with the status of the change. That can include whether it was approved or denied. Because this change was denied, it is not considered an issue on the project. The Change Control Board has already denied the change, so there is no need to perform additional analyses or resubmit it.

Your answer is incorrect
Monitor resources   

Develop team   

Manage team   

Correct answer
Control resources   

Overall explanation
Control resources is a process which ensures that physical resources are being utilized correctly. Manage team and develop team are used to manage the project team and not the physical resources. Monitor resources is a made-up process.

Question 108
Incorrect
The project manager and the project team are currently assessing various ways of responding to a particular risk. The project involves reconstructing part of their current office building, and they’re worried about a hurricane hitting and damaging the materials or parts of the unfinished building. The best response they came up with was to purchase insurance in case a hurricane does hit. What kind of strategy is this?   

Correct answer
Transfer   

Avoidance   

Acceptance   

Your answer is incorrect
Mitigate   

Overall explanation
When a risk is transferred, it is usually transferred to another company, such as by purchasing insurance or hiring a consultant. Avoidance is used to eliminate a risk by going down a different path. Mitigation is used to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk. Risk acceptance means doing nothing about the risk.
Question 109
Incorrect
The agile project team has determined that many of its processes have a lot of waiting and would like to remove all of the waste in the processes. What would be the best tool the agile team can use to improve their processes?

Correct answer
Value stream map

Your answer is incorrect
Fishbone analysis

Triple nickel

Process tailoring

Overall explanation
A value stream map is a visual representation of the flow of information through a process in which you can identify waste, such as waiting time, and optimize the process.

Question 110
Correct
The project team is currently working on a project to upgrade all the servers across the organization. Before they are able to get the financial server, the vendor calls and says the server delivery has been delayed 2 weeks. What documents should the project manager update immediately?   

Change request   

Work breakdown structure   

Project schedule   

Your answer is correct
Issue log   

Overall explanation
The issue log is used to keep track of all issues in the project. The delay of a server will mean the project might be delayed, so it should be entered into the issue log immediately. After that the project manager might implement a change request to extend the schedule baseline and update the project management plan. The work breakdown structure does not show work by time.
Question 111
Correct
The sponsor makes it clear that he does not want any of the team members to be overworked while working on a project. This means that no team member is allowed to work overtime. The sponsor is okay with the project being delayed due to this. What technique can the project manager best implement to ensure that no team member is overworked?   

Your answer is correct
Resource leveling   

Resource smoothing

Lag   

Free float   

Overall explanation
Resource leveling is a technique used when resources are limited or over-allocated. Resource leveling ensures that no resource is assigned to more than one activity at a time, ensuring that no resource is overworked. Resource smoothing may accomplish the same task, but it only works if there is slack available on the activities. Free float is the amount of time you can delay an activity without delaying the next activity. Lag is the amount of time you need to delay an activity before the next activity starts.
Question 112
Incorrect
The project team and the project manager held a meeting to discuss a few issues related to the project. The meeting was very productive and led to most of the issues being resolved. A few weeks later, one team member brought up one of the issues that was resolved in the previous meeting as being unresolved. The project manager reviewed the meeting documentation and determined that the issue was resolved, but the team member may not have known about the resolution. What could the project manager have done differently to prevent this miscommunication?

Correct answer
Distributed detailed meeting minutes   

Distributed a meeting agenda   

Your answer is incorrect
Ensured that the meeting stayed on topic   

Made sure the meeting was timed   

Overall explanation
While all the choices should be done for meetings, in this scenario, the project manager may have failed to distribute the meeting minutes. That would explain why a team member didn’t think an issue was resolved during the meeting.
Question 113
Correct
The project manager has acquired the project team members and is starting to work with them to complete the project work. During this process, the project manager has utilized a variety of rewards and recognition theories to keep the team motivated. What is the output of this process?

A project kickoff meeting is generally done after planning a large project to bring the team together and inform them of the project requirements. There is no need to inform senior management, as they approved the plan.
Question 116
Correct
The project team has completed the scope baseline and has started to break down each of the work packages into individual activities. What process should the team do next?

Develop Schedule   

Define Scope   

Your answer is correct
Sequence Activity   

Create WBS   

Overall explanation
After the team has created the activity list in the process of define activity, the next process should be sequencing the activities. This should be done before the team develops a schedule. Creating WBS and defining scope will come before defining activities.
Question 117
Incorrect
A project manager on an agile project conducts planning at multiple points in time as the scope is refined and changed over the project lifecycle. This is known as?

Progressive planning

Your answer is incorrect
Agile project planning

Correct answer

Checklists   

Questionnaires and surveys   

Correct answer
Focus groups   

Overall explanation
A focus group brings together subject matter experts to understand their perspectives and how they would go about solving problems. A brainstorming session is done by a group of stakeholders to gather ideas. A checklist can be created by an organization and then given to potential stakeholders, usually to identify factors they may want on a project. Questionnaires and surveys function almost the same as a checklist, which is used to gather stakeholders’ requirements.
Question 120
Correct
While conducting a risk assessment on a project, the project manager has identified a new regulatory risk. If the project is not completed by July 31, the company will have to scrap the project. What best describes this?   

Project requirement   

Project work   

Your answer is correct
Project constraint   

Project scope   

Overall explanation
There are 6 constraints on a project,: scope, cost, time, resources, risk, and quality. This project is constrained by time. The other choices are project requirements, not constraints.
Question 121
Incorrect
While working on a project, the project manager asks the team to incorporate more of the user feedback  into the deliverables. In an agile project, where do the customers give the team feedback on the product?

Correct answer
Sprint review   

Your answer is incorrect
Release feedback   

Sprint planning meeting   

Retrospective   

Overall explanation
During a sprint review, the customers review the partially finished product and give the team their feedback.

Overall explanation
Monitor Communications is where the project manager analyzes the project communications with the project management plan to ensure the communications are done according to the plan. Plan communication management is done to create the communication management plan. Manage Communications is where a project manager actually communicates with the stakeholders according to the plan. Conduct Communications is not an actual process.
Question 123
Correct
What is the main benefit for conducting the project using agile methodology versus traditional methodology?

Traditional delivers value at the beginning

Your answer is correct
Agile delivers value incrementally

Agile project requires funding up front

Traditional delivers values all up front

Overall explanation
One of the main benefits of using agile over traditional project management, is that agile delivers value incrementally compared to traditional where you get the value only at the end of the project.

Question 124
Correct
The project manager is conducting a presentation with a few of the senior stakeholders, and they are not happy with the progress of the project. The project manager has informed them that the delay is due to a contractor that was affected by a major flood a few weeks ago. What process does this best describe?   

Conduct communication   

Plan communication management   

Control communication   

Your answer is correct
Manage communication   

Overall explanation
Manage communication is done in the executing section of the project to update the stakeholders on the project’s progress. Plan communication management is used to create the communication management plan that describes how communication will take place on the project. Control and conduct communication are made-up processes.
Question 125
Correct
The project manager has just identified a new regulation that can possibly delay the project significantly. The project manager has added this new regulation to the risk register. What should the project manager do next with this risk?

Come up with a response to the delay in the project schedule   

Inform the project sponsor   

Request more funds to finish the project on time   

Your answer is correct
Conduct a qualitative and quantitative assessment   

Overall explanation
When a risk has been added to the risk register, the project manager should conduct both a qualitative and quantitative assessment before coming up with a risk response. If the response requires adding more money, the project manager should initiate a change request requesting more funds for the project. The project manager should assess the risk before informing the sponsor of the risk.
Question 126
Incorrect
While working on a project, the project team has encountered a problem that has halted the project work. The team is unable to come up with a solution and would like to have an outside company come in and finish the rest of the project. What should the project team do next?

Correct answer
Create a request for proposal   

Create a request for quotation   

Your answer is incorrect
Rewrite the scope statement   

Conduct a bidder conference   

Overall explanation
A request for proposal is used when there’s a problem on the project, and the solution is not easy to determine. This is generally a formal request made by project vendors to understand how they would rewrite the scope statement. Conducting a bidder conference will not come up with solutions to the problem with the project. A request for quotation is made to understand how a vendor develops satisfied requirements and how much it will cost.

Question 127
Incorrect
When selecting a project, the company looks at different factors that could impact their selection. What document best identifies the need for a project?   

Correct answer
Business Case   

Project Management Plan   

Project Benefits Report   

Your answer is incorrect
Project Charter   

Overall explanation
The business case is used to show the benefits of the project. The project charter is used to authorize the project. The project management plan outlines how to execute, monitor and control, and close the project. The project benefits report is a made-up term.
Question 128
Incorrect
The project manager, Peter, has been informed by the sponsor that the project needs to be completed 2 weeks earlier than the scheduled time. Peter goes to the team and informs them that they will need to work overtime to complete the project sooner. What is Peter doing to shorten the schedule?   

Adding leads to activities   

Scope reduction   

Your answer is incorrect
Fast tracking   

Correct answer
Crashing   

Overall explanation
Crashing adds resources to the project and will generally increase the cost. Since the team will be working overtime, this will result in additional costs to the project. Fast tracking is when you run activities in parallel. Adding leads to activities will overlap activities, which is not mentioned in the question. The sponsor has not authorized a scope change on the project.
Question 129
Incorrect
While constructing a new office space, the sponsor has requested the project manager complete the project sooner. While analyzing the work, the project manager has noticed that some of the work can start before the predecessor work is done. What can the project manager do in this scenario to complete the project sooner?   

Your answer is incorrect
Add lag times between project activities   

Add slack times between project activities   

Add reserves to each project activity   

Correct answer
Add lead times between project activities   

Overall explanation
A lead is an overlap between project activities. This means that work will start before the predecessor work is done. Lag time will add a delay between activities. Slack is the amount of time you can delay an activity without delaying the project. Reserves are the additional time added to the activities to account for risk.

Question 130
Correct
The deliverables for the office relocation project were accepted by the company stakeholders, and all office staff were very happy with the work of the movers. The office manager requested the project be closed immediately due to year-end budgetary closeouts. The movers filed a claim for an additional $300 for moving a copier that was not part of the plan. What should the project manager do next?   

Keep the project open and pay the claim.   

Close the project immediately and inform the office manager.   

Close the project immediately and update the accounting department to pay the claim.   

Your answer is correct
Keep the project open and inform claims administration.   

Overall explanation
A project can only be closed once all claims have been settled. Claims should be sent to claims administration, where negotiation would be the preferred way to resolve them.
Question 131
Correct
A project manager working in a large multinational corporation has been assigned to upgrade the company’s website. This project will require inputs for many functional managers across the organization from different countries. Each functional manager would like one of their representatives to be present on the project team. What would be the best tool or technique for handling this scenario in a cost-effective way?   

Visiting each functional manager to collect their requirements in person   

Using collocation   

Requesting a meeting with all functional managers in one location   

Your answer is correct
Using virtual teams   

Overall explanation
Virtual teams are used in the acquire resources process. Virtual teams are a cost-effective way to build multinational teams. Collocation is when you bring everyone into a single space to accomplish work. Although this may sound like a good solution, it is not cost-effective to have everyone fly to one location. If you were to visit each functional manager, this would not solve the problem of having the functional managers’ representatives on your project.
Question 132
Correct
The project manager has released the project team, completed the final lesson learned, and then completed the final report. The PMO has informed the project manager that it is not happy with this approach. What has the project manager done wrong?

Writing the final report after the lessons learned   

Your answer is correct
Releasing the team and then doing lessons learned

Nothing, these are the normal steps to closing a project     

Not informing the PMO about releasing the team   

Overall explanation
Lessons learned should be done with the team and not just by the project manager. The steps in closing usually involve conducting the lesson learned, releasing the team, and then writing the final report.
Question 133
Incorrect
While managing a datacenter project, a few customers requested a feature be added to the project that will enhance the security system in the datacenter. The change was submitted to the change control board and was denied due to the high cost of the security system. A few months later another customer submitted the same change back to the project manager. What is the best step the project manager can take in this scenario?   

Your answer is incorrect
Inform the change control board   

Assess how this change impacts the project management plan   

Add the security system to the datacenter   

Correct answer
Inform the customers the change cannot be done   

Overall explanation
The best thing to do in this scenario would be to inform the customer that the change cannot be added due to the fact that it was already rejected by the change control board. You should not add changes to a project management plan without it being first approved, and there is no need to inform the change control board again since its members have already denied it.
Question 134
Incorrect
Project manager Mary was informed by the team that the constant conflicts in the project have slowed down the team so that they are now behind in the work. Mary is not sure what she did wrong while planning the project. She used a RACI chart to assign roles to each team member. She has assigned each activity to at least two people who will be held accountable for the work. What best explains the conflicts in the project?     

Correct answer
Only one person should be held accountable for an activity when using a RACI chart.   

Your answer is incorrect
The team misread the RACI chart.   

Mary should have used more than just an RACI.

A RACI chart is not a tool that you can use to assign work.   

Overall explanation
When using a RACI chart, only one person should be held accountable per task on the chart, which applies to using a kind of tool to assign resources. When more than one person is held accountable, the team members will blame each other for work that was done incorrectly or not at all.
Question 135
Incorrect
The sponsor would like a report about the resources that are being used on the project. He would like to see them broken down by different categories to make them easier to understand. What process will the project manager use to create this?     

Correct answer
Estimate activity resources   

Your answer is incorrect
Sequence activities   

Define activities   

Develop schedule   

Overall explanation
The process of estimate activity resources will output the resource breakdown structure, which is a hierarchal breakdown of resources by their categories and types. No other choice will output this project document.
Question 136
Incorrect
While working on a tablet redesign project for large technology company, the project manager received a change request from a key stakeholder. The change request would change the position of the power button from the top to the side of the tablet. After an assessment of the change, the change control board declined the change due to concerns about redesigning the motherboard. What should the project manager do next?   

Conduct perform integrated control   

Correct answer
Update the change log   

Update the project management plan   

Your answer is incorrect
Update the lessons learned register   

Overall explanation
Once a change is approved or denied, the project manager should update the change log to list the status of the change. If a change is approved, the project management should be updated.
Question 137
Incorrect
A project manager has completed the project status report. The report states the CPI is 1.1 and the SPI is 1.14. The report was given to the project sponsor, who has become very upset about the project’s progress and has requested an immediate meeting with the project manager. What should the project manager report in the meeting?   

Their has been many changes to the scope that has cause the project to be over budget   

Correct answer
The project is progressing on schedule and budget   

Your answer is incorrect
The project is behind schedule and over budget due to scope creep   

Their has been many changes to the scope that has cause the project to be behind schedule   

Overall explanation

Question 138
Correct
You are having an issue with the software crashing consistently on the project. What should you use to identify the cause of this issue and the effect it may have on your project?

Your answer is correct
Ishikawa Diagram

Histogram   

Flowchart   

Continuous improvement   

Overall explanation
Ishikawa diagrams, or cause-and-effect diagrams, are used to identify probable causes and sub-causes of a particular problem. A histogram is a bar chart and a flowchart is used to represent a process graphically. Continuous improvement is a theory that is used to continuously improve a product over its life cycle.
Question 139
Correct
While planning a major network upgrade project, one stakeholder has given a requirement to upgrade the switches. The project manager has determined that this would be too costly to be included in the project and has decided to exclude it. What process will the project manager use to document this exclusion?   

Collect requirements   

Your answer is correct
Define Scope   

Create WBS   

Close project or phase   

Overall explanation
The project scope statement would have a list of deliverables and include things such as acceptance criteria, exclusions, constraints, and assumptions. The scope statement is created in the process of define the scope. None of the other choices output the scope statement.

Question 140
Incorrect
While monitoring and controlling the project, the project manager and the team have consistently received broken equipment from a particular vendor. They have spoken with the vendor and implemented a new process that will ensure the equipment does not show up broken. This seems to have solved the problem. What is the next step the project manager should take?

Your answer is incorrect
Analyze the problem   

Investigate the problem   

Solve the problem   

Correct answer
Check the solution   

Overall explanation
When encountering any problem on a project, the project manager should first identify the problem, define the problem, investigate, analyze, solve, and then check the solution. In this situation, the problem has already been solved, so the next step would be to check the solution to ensure the problem has actually been solved.
Question 141
Correct
The project manager is currently estimating how many programmers will be needed to complete the financial software upgrade project. What document can the project manager use to determine who is available to work on the project?

Planning   

Your answer is incorrect
Monitoring and controlling   

Closing   

Correct answer
Executing   

Overall explanation
The outputs of all the executed processes combined, including directly executing the process and managing project work, are the project deliverables. The output for planning would be the project management plan. The output for closing would be the final product service or result transition and the final report. The output for monitoring and controlling would be the accepted deliverables and the work performance reports.
Question 146
Incorrect
A project manager is having a very difficult time negotiating with a functional manager. The project manager would like to have Peter, the system administrator, work on the project full time, but the functional manager needs Peter full time to work on the servers throughout the day in case one goes down. After a few days of negotiating, the project manager has determined that he will have Peter from Monday to Wednesday, and the functional manager can have Peter on Thursday and Friday. Although this solution is not the most ideal scenario for the project manager and functional manager, it will have to work for now. What conflict resolution technique was used?   

Smoothing   

Correct answer
Compromising   

Problem solving   

Your answer is incorrect
Forcing   

Overall explanation
Compromising is when both sides in a conflict give up something to come up with a solution. Smoothing is when the problem is pushed aside, and forcing is when one side completely wins and the other side completely loses. Problem-solving is the best way, but that would require both sides to come up with a solution in which they both win.

Question 157
Incorrect
The project team has completed a major deliverable on the game development project. The deliverable was given to the project manager. What action should the project manager take next?   

Correct answer
Check the deliverable for quality requirements   

Ask the team to review the deliverable   

Your answer is incorrect
Get acceptance from the project sponsor   

Close the project   

Overall explanation
Once a deliverable is complete in the process of direct and manage project work, the next process would be to control quality; the deliverable should be checked for quality requirements so it can be accepted by a customer or sponsor. The project should not be closed until the deliverable has been accepted. There is no need to have the project team review the deliverable since they have deemed it completed and handed it to the project manager.

Question 158
Incorrect

Remind them that the resolution can only be approved by the agile project manager

Overall explanation
During the storming phase of the Tuckman’s letter, the agile project manager should be coaching the team to support constructive disagreement. Let the team find the best methods to resolve their issues.

Question 162
Correct
The product owner has added three new changes to the product backlog. The agile project manager has met with the team and they have decided immediately how to implement these new changes, although these changes will be implemented until three iterations from now. The product owner informs the agile project manager that he is not happy about this. What should the agile project manager do?

Ask the product owner when he would like the changes to be implemented

Your answer is correct
Tell the team they should not have committed to doing these changes until they were ready to implement them

Ask the team members to implement the change right away 

Inform the product owner of the potential risk of each change

Overall explanation
One of the core principles of agile is to defer decisions. This means not making decisions about potential changes or features until the very last minute.

Question 163
Incorrect

Project calendar   

Pareto chart     

Earned value charts   

Your answer is correct
Burndown chart   

Overall explanation
A burndown chart is used on agile projects to show work that remains to be completed. A project calendar is an input, not a tool. A Pareto chart is used in quality management to show what issues might be causing the most defects in a project. It displays the 80/20 rule. Earned value charts is a made-up term.

Question 165
Incorrect
When using different prioritization techniques what is the most important aspect that the agile project manager should communicate to the customers?

Make sure to include timing in the use of any prioritization technique

Your answer is incorrect
Make sure to include cost in the use of any prioritization technique

Prioritization techniques are not needed on agile projects

Overall explanation
When using any prioritization technique, it is important the customer understands not to worry too much about the specifics of the technique but rather to prioritize the features based on relative value.

Question 166
Incorrect
The project manager and the team have worked many hours to calculate the amount of time it will take to conduct each activity. They would like to document some of the assumptions they made and the constraints they may face when the project is executed. What document will they use for this?   

Correct answer
Basis of estimates   

Project schedule   

Your answer is incorrect
Cost estimates   

Duration estimates   

Overall explanation
The basis of estimates documents how the team arrived at their estimates regarding the project activities, such as assumptions, constraints, range of estimates, and the confidence level of the estimates. The duration and cost estimates will not have these components. The project schedule will outline how long the project will take, which includes a network diagram, Gantt chart, and the milestone chart.

Question 167
Correct
While developing complex software for an organization, the project team creates a computer-generated model of what it will look like when it is done. This model is given to the customers for their feedback. What best describes this model?

Screenshots   

Data analysis   

Data representation   

Your answer is correct
Prototypes   

Overall explanation
A prototype is generally a mock-up or functional product that is given to the customers for feedback. Data representation and data analysis are tools used to analyze data and present them in various forms, such as graphs or charts. Screenshots are pictures taken from a screen of an application, not a model of how the application will work.

Question 169
Incorrect
While measuring quality on a project, the project team decided to just measure the quality as pass/fail. The team has determined that this is the best method because the deliverables are mostly functions that will need to produce a correct result. What best describes this measurement?   

Your answer is incorrect
Statistical independence   

Statistical sampling   

Correct answer
Attribute sampling   

Mutually exclusive   

Overall explanation
An attribute sample is a measurement that is usually pass/fail or good/bad. Statistical sampling is a measurement that is not just pass/fail; it also has a middle ground, such as good, very good, bad, or very bad. Statistical independence means that an outcome of two events cannot affect each other, and mutually exclusive is a term that is used when two events cannot happen at the same time.
Question 170
Correct

The change control board’s purpose is to manage changes to the project, which include assessing changes and stopping unnecessary changes. The change control board is not there to deny changes unless it has been assessed and deemed unnecessary in the project.
Question 172
Correct
The project team has identified a number of risks that could affect the project. One risk in particular is that the permit to build the foundation has shown up late. They have ranked this risk as the most important in the project since it will cause the largest delay. What process best describes this ranking?   

Identify risk   

Plan risk management   

Quantitative risk analysis   

Your answer is correct
Qualitative risk analysis   

Overall explanation
A qualitative risk process is done to rank the risk that has been identified in the identify risk process. Quantitative risk analysis is done to assign a value to the risk. Plan risk management is done to create the risk management plan, which will document how to conduct all the risk management processes.
Question 173
Correct
The project manager has brought the project team together to explain what the project will be about and what their roles will be. The team members introduce themselves and learn about the different skill sets each of them brings to the project. What stage on Tuckman’s ladder best represents this?   

Performing   

Your answer is correct
Forming   

Storming   

Norming   

Overall explanation
In the forming stage of Tuckman’s ladder, the team is formed and learns about each other. In the norming phase, they stop storming and come to an agreement on how to conduct the work.

Correct answer
153   

306   

360   

Your answer is incorrect
160   

Overall explanation
To get this answer correct, you will have to use the communications channels formula, which is N(N-1)/2. Since there are 18 stakeholders, the formula is 18(18-1)/2 = 153.
Question 176
Incorrect
A project manager is currently working with the team to complete the office redesign project when a sponsor tells him to finish it 2 weeks sooner than planned. The project manager will need 4 new people to join the team to complete the work by the new deadline. What technique is best described in this scenario?   

Fast tracking   

Your answer is incorrect
Critical path method   

Correct answer
Crashing   

Schedule variance

Correct answer
Resource breakdown structure   

Your answer is incorrect
Resource register   

Resource category matrix   

Overall explanation
The resource breakdown structure is a breakdown of the resources by categories or types. The resource requirements describe all the resources needed to complete an activity. The resource register and resource category matrix are made-up terms.

Question 179
Incorrect

Expert judgment   

Parametric estimation   

Correct answer
Cost aggregation   

Your answer is incorrect
Bottom-up estimation   

Overall explanation
If the activities have been assigned costs, then the process of estimate costs has been completed. The next process would be to determine budget and use the cost aggregation tool to integrate all the activities into the overall budget of the project. The tools of bottom-up estimation and parametric estimation are not used to determine a budget. An expert may help in determining the costs, but not to aggregate them.

Question 180
Correct
While planning a project, the project manager is given many requirements that the customers would like to add to the project. Upon further investigation, the project manager decides that a few of the requirements will not be feasible within the limited time and cost allocated to the project.

    ans:
    A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs implemented to achieve a strategic (long-term) business goal. All the other choices are made up.


Question 2:
    As the project team is collecting the new project’s requirements, the organization’s legal department has informed them of a new law that could affect the project. The team determines that it is mandatory to implement this new law in the project. What is this called? 
    Ans:
    A regulation is an official guideline that must be followed by the project, usually imposed by local or national law. A standard is a guideline that should be followed, but is not mandatory. A baseline is used to measure the performance of the project, such as cost, schedule, and scope. A system is a set of processes and procedures that a company will implement to manage something, such as accounting procedures to invoice customers.


Question 3:
    Peter is working on a project that he knows little about. He was assigned by the project management office (PMO) 
    and they have almost complete control over the project. What type of PMO best describes this scenario?
    Ans:  Directive
    In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing the projects and assigning the project manager. 
    Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing templates and frameworks. 
    Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control on the project. “Guiding” is not a type of PMO.

Question 4:
    Mary’s new project staff are some of the best talents in the company. The team members will use their own methodologies and prefer to be in control of the project; they would only like to be provided templates and lessons learned  from other projects. What type of PMO would be best for this project? 
    Ans:
    Since the team will be mostly in control and just needs templates, the best fit would be “supportive.” In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing projects and assigning the project manager. Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing methodologies or frameworks. “Managing” is not a type of PMO.

Question 5:
    Pat is working in an organization where she does project management full time. 
    However, she still needs to consult with functional managers in order to acquire her project team. 
    What organizational structure type best describes this situation?   
    Ans:Strong matrix
    In a strong matrix, the project manager is full time and has a moderate to high control over resources. 
    In a weak or functional matrix, project management is part-time. 
    In a project-oriented organization, the project manager has high to complete control over resources.

Question 6:
    Ian has been working on an office remodel project for close to 6 months. 
    He feels like the project is going poorly due to a lack of resources from the functional managers and his lack of time to work 
    on the project. Ian spends most of his day doing operational work. What organizational structure best describes this?   
    Ans:
    In a weak matrix, project management is part-time and resource availability is controlled by the functional manager. 
    All other choices require a full-time project manager.

Question 7:
    ABX Shipping is a large global company with many departments, some of which are have part-time project management and others, 
    such as research and development, where it is full time. 
    Where the project managers work determines their control over resources. What organizational structure best describes this organization?   
    Ans:hybrid
    In a hybrid, the company uses multiple types of structures, such as functional and project-oriented. 
    Answers A and B are not organizational types. 
    Project-oriented requires project managers to be full time and have control over resources.

Question 8:
    Mark has just started a new job as a project coordinator for a company. He will be working with a group to develop their new website. Mark finds working on this project to be difficult due to always needing the company owner’s approval for budget matters. He also has very few resources to work with because the company is very small. What organizational structure best describes this scenario?   
    Ans:organic
    In an organic or simple structure, the owner controls the budget, and there are few to no resources. 
    Answers B and C are not organizational structure types. 
    A weak matrix would have a functional manager to control the budget.

Question 9:
    Mark has just started working for a company that has little to no project management framework or functions. He notices that most people manage projects on their own with no oversight or established processes. Mark has spoken the CEO and they have decided to change this. What is this organization lacking?   
    Ans:
    Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide a company to create a project. The other choices are made up.

    Project management and operations management are sometimes managed by the same set of people. What is one of the key differences between project and operations management?   
    Ans:
    Project management is a temporary endeavor, while operations management is ongoing and never stops. A project manager does not necessarily need to be certified.

Question 11:
    Mark has gotten a new job at a company that is about to create a new product. This new product will be a very complex software that may take years to create and have many different groups of people. Mark has decided to break up this complex project into smaller subprojects and manage them individually. What is Mark managing?   
    Ans:
    A program is a group of related projects that are managed in coordination to obtain the benefits of not managing them individually. A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and other portfolios. A project is a single temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or other result.

Question 12:
    Many organizations have different strategic goals. Which of the following helps an organization attain these goals?
    Ans:
    A portfolio achieves the organization’s strategic objectives. While projects and programs may help complete a portfolio, they may not always achieve strategic objectives in themselves. “Operations” generally maintain an organization’s current processes.


Question 13:
    Mary has just completed one of the most important deliverables of the project. 
    She meets with the organization’s senior management, and they have not determined if the project should continue or not, 
    as the current deliverable may be all they need. What would best describe this review?   
    Ans:Phase Gate
    A phase gate is done at the end of a phase, deciding whether to continue to the next phase or not. 
    A kickoff meeting is generally done at the end of planning and sometimes at the end of the project’s initiated sections 
    in order to start the next section. Answers C and D do not exist.


Question 14:
    What best describes an area of project management where the project manager will work with the project team in order to 
    complete the project work?   
    Ans:“Executing”
    “Executing” is the process group where the project manager acquires both the physical and human resources to complete the project work. 
    The main output of execution is the project deliverables (work). 
    “Initiating” is used to authorize the project, and “planning” is used to determine 
    the course of action needed to build the deliverables. 
    “Closing” is used to review the project and transition the deliverables to the customer or sponsor.


Question 15:
    Project manager Bill has started planning his project and will gather all requirements from his customers, then build the project deliverable in its entirety. Bill will generally not get any input from the customer while the product is being made, and the customer will only review it at the end. What life cycle best describes Bill’s project?     
    Ans:
    A predictive life cycle is when the project scope is known early in the project. For Bill to create the deliverable in its entirety without any feedback from the customer, he will have gathered the scope in its entirety before executing the project. All other choices are adaptive and used in projects when the deliverable is built in increments, with continuous customer feedback.


Question 16:
    Mary has just been awarded a new product development project. After speaking with some of the customers, it seems that they do not know how they would like the product to look and feel. They would like to be more involved in the product development and give Mary continuous feedback. What project life cycle would best fit this project?   
    Ans:
    In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is built in a series of iterations with continuous feedback from project stakeholders. “Predictive” or “waterfall” are the same thing, and are only used when the scope is known early in the project. “Non-predictive” does not exist.


Question 17:
    One phase of the project has been completed, and the stakeholders are very happy with the transition of the project deliverable. 
    What would be the next best step on this project?
    Ans:Phase gate or Phase review
    When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct a phase gate or phase review to 
    determine whether to continue the project or end it. 
    You should not start a phase if you have not reviewed the previously finished phase. 
    Archive project records would have been done in the phase that was just completed. A kickoff meeting is used at the end of 
    planning or when initiating a section of the project in order to start the next section.





Quiz 2: Integration Quiz
---------------------------------------------
Question 1:
A project manager is about to start planning a new sales software development project and will 
work with the project team to create a project management plan. 
What will the project manager and the team not use in planning a project?  
Ans:
Work performance information is an output of monitoring and controlling and is not used during planning. 
The scope statement, scope baseline, and risk register are all created during the planning processes.


Question 2:
The project manager has received a change request from the project sponsor to reduce the budget by 20%. 
After the project manager has reviewed the change, he decides that the only way this can 
be done is by removing a part of the project that is not yet completed. Who should approve this change?   
Ans:
The change control board (CCB) is a group that helps the project manager to assess and deny or approve changes. 
The project team may only help assess the change. “Change approval” and “management board” are made up.


Question 3:
The CEO of a small business has requested that the company’s accounting software be upgraded to better support their financial records. 
He has requested that the software include a report that can forecast the following month’s expenses. 
Where would be the best place the CEO can outline why this project needs to get done?   
Ans:
The business documents contain two parts: the business case and the benefits management plan. 
In this question, the business case would be used to explain why the project would need to get done. 
The “scope outline” is a made-up term. The scope statement and WBS shows the work needed to finish the project.


Question 4:
Project manager Mike worked with the sponsor, Chris, to get the project charter approved for the new office reorganizing project. 
While reviewing the requirements, both Mike and Chris are sure that there is no need to upgrade the office’s current wireless network. 
Where is the best place for Mike and Chis to store this information?   
Ans:
Mike and Chris are making an assumption, as they are sure of their determination but don’t know it for a fact; 
an assumption log is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project. 
A project charter and business case have nothing to do with assumptions. “Assumption documentation” is a made-up term.


Question 5:
While working on creating a project management plan, the project manager has brought a group of expert programmers 
and a planner to ensure it is created correctly. What tool best describes this approach?   
Ans:
The tool that is being used is a focus group, which is part of data gathering. “Meeting” and “interpersonal 
and team skills” do not involve a focus group. Data analysis is used to analyze data that has already been gathered.


Question 6:
When a project has been executed, what input would best help the project manager determine how to manage changes to the project?   
Ans:
The project management plan contains the change management plan. 
The change management plan will outline how changes are requested, assessed, approved, or disapproved. 
The change control board approves or disapproves changes. The term change control chart is a made-up term.


Question 7:
Company XYZ has been executing a new business development project for the last 4 months. 
A few stakeholders have requested changes to the scope and have gotten them approved. 
When a change is approved, what is the next best step to conduct on a project?   
Ans:
Once a change request has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project 
manager will then execute the change in the direct and manage project work process. 
Approved change request is not an input into the processes of monitor and control project work, validate scope, and close project or phase.


Question 8:
A change control board has informed the project manager that a change request made by stakeholder 
Mark to reduce the project schedule by 2 weeks was rejected. What is the first step the project manager should take?   
Ans:
Once a change has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the change log to reflect the status of the change. 
Asking Mark to reduce his change request by 1 week would need a new change request. 
The change was already rejected, there is no need to get the team involved. 
Resubmitting the change request, without any new changes would result in the same outcome.


Question 9:
The deliverable for the product improvement project has been accepted by the sponsor. 
What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the close project or phase process. 
In that process the project manager will discuss the lessons learned and release or reassign the project team. 
A project manager should never leave a project without formally closing it.


Question 10:
Project team member Josh has learned a new method to program the financial application by reading a book about functions in applications. 
What kind of knowledge is this?   
Ans:
Explicit knowledge is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. 
“Tacit” is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. “Common” and “programming” are not types of knowledge.


Question 11:
While executing a project, the project manager has learned that an IT vendor will delay the delivery 
of the server needed to implement the phone system. This problem will need to be resolved soon. What should the PM do first?   
Ans:
The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the issue log. From there, the PM can get a change 
request to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. 
Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the project management plan.


Question 12:
The project team is currently working on the office move project, and they have completed moving one of the floors to the other building. 
While the work is progressing, what document would be best for the project manager to update?   
Ans:
The work performance data will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done. 
The issue log is only updated when there are issues on the project. 
Change logs are only updated once a change request is filed. “Work logs” is a made-up term.


Question 13:
The project sponsor has been asking the project manager to close the project as soon as possible, 
since the deliverable has been created. The project manager has informed the sponsor that the project cannot close yet. 
What best explains why the project manager cannot close the project?   
Ans:
In order for the project or phase to be closed, the deliverable has to be accepted. 
An accepted deliverable is a key input to the process of close project or phase. 
You will release the project team during the close project or phase. If the deliverable was defective, then it would not be considered done.


Question 14:
A company has plans to improve one their products. They have started to work with Mary to get this 
project authorized by the board of directors. What is the output of this process?   
Ans:
The project charter is used to authorize a project. The project management plan and stakeholder register come after the charter is created. 
The business documents are an input to create project charters.


Question 15:
When creating a project management plan what component will address how to approve changes on a project?   
Ans:
The change management plan is a part of the project management plan that describes how to manage changes on a project. 
That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected. The other choices are made up.


Question 16:
A project team has just completed a major module in a new application. 
They were able to complete it in about half the time that was approved for them using a new method from a recent programmers’ publication. 
What should the project manager do first with this new programming method?   
Ans:
Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the lesson learned register. 
This will ensure that the knowledge is saved and can be used throughout the project, as well as on future projects. 
Updating the plan or sponsor will not update the lesson learned register or document the method. 
You cannot close a project or phase if it had not been completed and accepted.


Question 17:
While executing a large project for building a bridge, the PM has received a request that would affect the structure 
of the bridge and may need it to be completely redesigned. The change came from the local transportation department. 
What should the PM do next?   
Ans:
The first step would be to assess the changes and understand how it would affect the project, which may lead to 
stopping the work and redesigning the bridge. 
You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. 
Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.


Question 18:
A phase of a long software development project has been completed. 
The phase was considered very successful: the team was able to complete the deliverables in about half the time and under budget. 
The deliverables were successfully transferred to the next phase of the project. What should the project manager do next for this phase?   
Ans:
The final report is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project. 
While you can initiate or plan another phase on a project, the question does state “for this phase.” “Update project management plan” 
is not an output of close project or phase.


Question 19:
While monitoring and controlling the project, the project manager notices that the project has been 
behind schedule for 2 out of the 3 weeks. The PM thinks it will also be behind schedule this week. 
What kind of data analysis is this?   
Ans:
Trend analysis is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. 
Variance analysis is only used to find a variance, not to predict it. “Prediction analysis” is made up, and expert judgement is 
not part of data analysis.

Quiz 3: Scope Management Quiz
==========================================

Question 1:
When creating a scope baseline, the project manager, Joe, has decided to include where the work is supposed to take place. Where in the WBS will this information be stored?   
Ans:
The WBS dictionary has all details about each work package, such as who is doing it, where it’s getting done, and its cost.


Question 2:
The project manager has met with the company PMO to ask for guidance about creating a scope statement for the project. The PMO had given him all the steps he should follow when creating a scope statement. What document would the project manager best store these steps in?
Ans:
The scope management plan will outline all the steps the project manager will follow to conduct the scope processes, including defining the scope and creating the WBS.


Question 3:
The project manager has met a few of the team members, and they have decided to document how the software they're working on will function. They record a feature where users will be able to email reports from the software with one click. What document best describes what they are creating?
Ans:
The product scope will outline the product’s features and functionality.


Question 4:
The project manager, Peter, is collecting requirements for the project. He is not sure of the best step to take in order to correctly collect them from the company’s senior management. What document should Peter refer to?   
Ans:
The requirements management plan will outline all the steps the project manager will take to collect, measure, test, and verify requirements.


Question 5:
The project manager, Peter, has met the sponsor, Mary, and has informed her that the project has been delayed due the requirements not being documented correctly. What process was not done correctly during planning?
Ans:
Collect requirements is a process where the requirements are gathered from all stakeholders on the project.


Question 6:
The project team has given the customers access to the new software they created in order to get feedback and see if there is room for improvement. What tool best describes this?   
Ans:
A prototype is used as a tool in the process of collect requirements. It is a working product that is given to users in order to collect feedback and gather their requirements.


Question 7:
The project has conducted a brainstorming session and generated a lot of ideas for their new financial software. The project manager notices that the ideas seem to be in no particular order and would like them to be grouped together. What tool or technique would best help the team?   
Ans:
An affinity diagram is used to group and review ideas.


Question 8:
The project manager has spoken with the customers about what quality requirements there are looking for on the office renovation project. They have specifically said they want to use good quality materials with high durability. Where would be best for the project manager to store this request?   
Ans:
The quality requirements are stored in the requirements documentation, which is an output of collect requirements.


Question 9:
The company has started to work on a new accounting software that would allow the company to better manage their expenses. After they have created the scope statement, they then start to learn more about each deliverable and the efforts needed to produce them. What process best describes this?   
Ans:
“Create WBS” is generally done after the scope statement is created and decomposes the deliverables into work packages.


Question 10:
The project team has completed the deliverables for the project and has checked them to ensure all quality requirements have been met. They have informed the sponsor to review the deliverable with them in order to gain a sign-off on its completion. What tool would be best used in this process?   
Ans:
Inspection is the tool used in the process of validate scope by the stakeholders to formally accept the verified deliverables.


Question 11:
The project manager has noticed that a member of the project team has been doing work that was not in the WBS. When asked why he was doing so, the team member says the sponsor requested the work and he felt he needed it to be done. What process most accurately describes this scenario?   
Ans:
The control scope process is where the project manager compares the planned work to the actual work to ensure there is no variance. If there is a variance a change request might be needed to correct it.




Question 12:
The team is getting ready to break down the deliverables on the scope statement. They are not sure how to conduct this process. What document would best help them?   



Question 13:
The customers of a new office renovation project are not too sure what the project will and will not do. The planning for the project has been completed and it’s now about to be executed. Where can the customers look to see what work the project will not be doing?   
Ans:
The scope statement lists exclusions, or work the project will not be doing.



Question 14:
Mark was assigned a new project to install a new phone system. He feels he can learn more about the customer’s requirements if he watches them use their current analog system. What tool or technique best describes his approach?     
Ans:
Job shadowing is an example of the observation/conversation part of interpersonal and team skills.


Question 15:
A project team has completed a new smartphone for a major phone manufacturer. During testing they compared their boot time to a few other smartphones made by other companies and realized their phone is very slow by comparison. What could the project team have used to ensure this was addressed during planning?
Ans:
Benchmarking is used on projects to compare its performance or specifications to other projects or industry standards.


Question 16:
While working on a project, the team has encountered many change requests from the customers and sponsor. The project manager has informed the team that the requirements were not collected in detail from the start of the project. What would be the first action the PM and team could take?    
Ans:
The first action the team should take is to identify what was done during the planning processes to gain a better understanding of what went wrong. Then they can redo the process of collect requirements if needed and update the project management plan with the correct requirements.


Question 17:
The project team has completed the new security alarm system for the building and has informed the project manager. The project manager inspected it and verified that it works according to all building and safety regulations. What would be the next process the project manager should conduct?   
Ans:
Since the work has been completed and the project manager has checked the deliverable to ensure it meets the quality requirements, the next process would be to get the sponsors or customers to give a formal acceptance in the validate scope process before closing the project or phase.


Question 18:
During a major construction project of a large building the project manager realizes that the scope didn’t include a new safety regulation. If the building is completed and doesn’t include the regulation the building will not be approved for occupancy. What should the project manager do next?   
Ans:
The first action the project manager should take is to analyze how the regulation will affect the project. From there, the project manager might have to get a change request to modify the project management plan to incorporate the regulation.





The best solution here would be to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements in detail. This can include scheduling meetings ahead of time. The project manager should not write the requirements or write a scope statement with just a few of the project requirements. The project has been approved and should not be stopped.
Question 19:
The project manager is having a difficult time collecting requirements from the stakeholders. They never seem to have time to meet with the project manager. What should the project manager do in this situation?

Write the requirements himself
Continue to work with the stakeholders to collect the requirements
Create the scope statement from the requirements that have already been collected
Stop the project until they have time to give the requirements


The scope is missing one component, the WBS dictionary. Mary should create it and add it to the scope statement and WBS. The scope baseline is made up of 3 components, the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary.
Question 20:
The project manager, Mary, has completed the scope statement and the WBS for a small project. She has approached the sponsor about gaining approval for the scope baseline. Upon inspection, the sponsor decided the scope baseline doesn’t have enough information in it. What is the best action Mary can take?

Work with the team and create a WBS dictionary
Go back to the collect requirements processes to ensure all requirements were added to the scope baseline
Ask the sponsor to write the scope
Work with the team to create a project schedule and cost baseline

Quiz 4: Schedule Management Quiz
==============================================



Question 1:
While getting ready to manage the project schedule, the project manager would like to document how accurate the schedule must be and what model the team will use to create the schedule. What document would have this information?   
Ans:
The schedule management plan will describe how the schedule will be planned, developed, managed, executed, and controlled throughout the project, as well as the level of accuracy, reporting formats, and schedule model.


Question 2:
In developing the schedule management plan, which of the following tools will the project manager use?   
Ans:
Data analysis is a tool that is used in plan schedule management to create the schedule management plan. The other choices are not tools in this process.


Question 3:
The project manager has met with the project team to define the activities on the project. Which of the following components of the project management plan will the team not use to define the activities?   
Ans:
The WBS, WBS dictionary, and scope statement are part of the scope baseline, which is an input to the process of define activities. The activity list is the output of the process, not an input.


Question 4:
While conducting the process of define activities, a few of the team members have decided to use the lesson learned repository from previous projects. Which of the following inputs describes this lesson learned repository?   
Ans:
The organizational process assets include but are not limited to the lesson learned repository from previous projects and templates. The other choices do not include the lesson learned repository.



Question 5:
The activity lists and WBS are used to help create the scope baseline and the schedule baseline. Which of the following statements is true regarding these two documents?
Ans:
The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently. The WBS is part of the scope baseline, while the activity list is not part of the schedule baseline, only considered a project document.


Question 6:
The project team has embarked on a very complex software development project and is currently having a difficult time decomposing work packages that will be done later; they have decided to decompose these work packages as they get closer to the work. What technique best represents the scenario?   
Ans:
Rolling wave planning is a planning technique in which future work is decomposed as the work gets closer. Decomposition is done to break down the deliverables and work packages into activities. Future planning is not a valid tool or technique.


Question 7:
While decomposing project activities which of the following statements is true regarding the usage of this technique?   
Ans:
Decomposition is best done when the team members are involved, since they are considered subject matter experts and will generally lead to more accurate results. It should be done throughout the project as more work is done and understood. It is not a tool used in sequence activity or defined scope processes.



Question 8:
The project sponsor is examining the project schedule and has noticed a few activities with a duration of zero. What best describes these activities?   
Ans:
Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event on the project. All other choices are made-up terms.


Question 9:
While working on a large building development project the team has identified a particular warehouse they would use to fabricate the steel beams. Where would the team store this information?   
Ans:
The activity attributes can be used to identify the place where the work is to be performed. The activity list is just a list of all activities on the project. The milestone list will identify all milestones on the project. The project schedule network diagram will not show the location of work, just the sequence thereof.


Question 10:
Which of the following methods is used to construct a schedule in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked?   
Ans:
The precedence diagramming method is used to construct a schedule in which the activities are represented graphically using nodes and are linked based on their relationship. The critical path method is used to find the critical path for a network diagram. “Scheduling method” and “diagramming method” are made-up terms.


Question 11:
While working on a large systems upgrade project, the project team has decided that they can install the servers and the workstations at the same time. The activities will all start at the same time but the workstation installations will take a bit longer to finish. What relationship best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
The relationship of “start to start” is when a successor activity cannot start until the predecessor activity has started. This means that they both generally started the same time, but they may not finish at the same time.



Question 12:
While working on a network installation project the project team has determined that they must finish the router configurations before they can set up the workstations. The workstations cannot be set up until the router configurations are done. What kind of dependency does this best describes?   
Ans:
Mandatory dependencies are dependencies in which one activity must be done in order for another activity to start. Discretionary dependencies are when the sequence of activities does not necessarily have to be done in that particular order, but is usually at the discretion of the person doing the work. “Physical dependency” is a made-up term.




Question 13:
The project team has filed for a permit in order to continue building the foundation for a large office building. The permit usually takes about 6 weeks to arrive, and the team is worried it may take even longer. What kind of dependency best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
External dependency is when the work is outside of the project team’s control, such as getting a permit. Internal dependency is usually within the project team’s control. “Permit dependency” is a made-up term.



Question 14:
The builders have completed the foundation for the large office building. Upon completion, they have filed a permit, and are told by the permit office that they will have to wait about 3 weeks for inspection. How should these 3 weeks be represented in the project schedule?   
Ans:
A lag is a delay between activities. Although “delay” is a somewhat correct answer, using the term “lag” is more appropriate for a PMP exam. A lead is an overlap of work on a project.




Question 15:
While installing the servers and workstations on a project, the team has decided that they do not have to wait for all the servers to be installed before they start installing the workstations. They have decided to install just a few of the main servers, and then they can start installing the workstations. What best describes what they’re doing on the schedule?   
Ans:
A lead is an overlap between activities, in which one activity can start before the other activity is done. Although “overlap” would be a good choice, the term “lead” is a better answer for a PMP question. A lag is a delay between activities.




Question 16:
While estimating the duration of activities on the project, the project team has decided to base most of their estimates on historical data from a project they completed a few months ago that is very similar to the current project. This would allow them to complete the estimate fairly quickly. What technique best illustrates this scenario?   
Ans:
Analogous estimating is based on historical information, generally from previous projects that were very similar. This technique would lead to a quick estimate, but may not be very accurate. Expert judgment is using subject matter experts in order to estimate the duration, and bottom-up estimation is done by aggregating the work in order to come up with the duration. Parametric estimating is usually a mathematical model based on historical information.



Question 17:
While working on a complex software development project, the project team has added an additional month to the project schedule due to the uncertainty of the work getting done. What type of reserve does this represent?   
Ans:
“Contingency reserve” is associated with a known-unknown and is usually added to the project management plan. A management reserve is generally for an unknown-unknown and not added to the project management plan. “Risk” and “expert judgment reserves” are made-up terms.



Question 18:
The project team has completed all duration estimates for the activities on the project and has indicated that their estimates should be within a -10 to +10% range. Where should the project team store this range? 
Ans:
The basis of estimates would generally indicate the range of possible estimates. The schedule baseline and schedule management plan will not indicate the possible range of the estimates, while the activity list is simply a list of activities that will take place on the project.



Question 19:
The project manager is constructing the project schedule and would like to know the minimum duration needed to complete the project. What method can he used to determine the minimum duration?   
Ans:
The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule flexibility. The precedence diagramming method is used to construct the project schedule network diagram showing the dependencies between activities. The “scheduling” and “duration” methods are made-up terms.



Question 20:
The project sponsor has indicated to the project manager that he is not happy with the current project schedule. He would like the project to be completed at least 3 months earlier than its scheduled completion date. What technique can the project manager use to compress the schedule while minimizing cost?   
Ans:
“Fast tracking” the schedule is a compression technique in which activities are generally done in parallel. This technique generally increases the risk on the project but may not increase costs. “Crashing” is adding more resources to the project to finish it faster, and will increase costs.



Question 21:
Due to the complex nature of a construction project, the project manager has decided that the project is best done outside normal working hours, generally overnight. Where should the project manager document this information?   
Ans:
A project calendar identifies the working days and shifts that the project will follow.



Question 22:
While working on an agile project, what can the project manager do in order to track the work that remains to be completed on the project?   
Ans:
An iteration burndown chart shows the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. “Earned value analysis” is a series of formulas that assess project performance and progress. Expert judgment is about using subject matter experts, and trend analysis is to see whether the project is staying on or off schedule.

Quiz 5: Cost Management Quiz
==============================================

Question 1:
When developing the cost management plan, what tool or technique includes reviewing the different funding options that can be used to fund the project?   
Ans:
Data analysis includes alternative analysis, which includes reviewing strategic funding options. Meetings and expert judgment do not examine different funding options. External funding is not a valid tool.


Question 2:
While working on a multinational project, the project manager has decided to represent the project budget in American dollars, even though the project will span nine different countries. This will make the budget uniform and easier for the stakeholders to understand. Where will the project manager document the units of measurement for the budget?   
Ans:
The cost management plan can establish the units of measurement which would include the currency format. All other choices are fake plans.



Question 3:
Early in the project’s planning phase, the project team determined that the cost to install a server would be $15,000. This is a high-level estimate, and the team thinks it may cost up to $10,000 more. What kind of estimate is this?   
Ans:
A rough order of magnitude estimate has a range of -25% to +75%. A definitive estimate is generally within the range of -5% to +10%. Wide and plan estimates are not actual types of estimates.


Question 4:
Cost estimates for activities generally include the cost for labor, materials, equipment, services, and facilities. Which of the following statements is false regarding cost estimates?   
Ans:
Cost estimates for project activities should not include the operational costs of the product, since those costs cover operations and not a project. All other choices are true.



Question 5:
While working on a game design project, the project sponsor has asked the project manager to ensure that his estimates are very precise. What estimating technique should the project manager use?   
Ans:
Bottom-up estimating is when work packages are broken down and then rolled back up to form an overall cost estimate. This can lead to a very precise estimate, although it requires the most amount of work. Analogous estimating is a quick estimate that is based on previous projects. Three-point estimating uses the PERT formula and may or may not be accurate . Accuracy estimating is a made-up term.




Question 6:
The project manager and the project team determined that the budget for the project will be $60,000. That includes the cost for all the activities and all uncertainties that may have taken place during the project. The project cost baseline is $60,000. The sponsor has determined that if there is a need for additional funds, he will add an additional $5,000. The additional $5,000 represents what?     
Ans:
Management reserves are added to the cost baseline in case the project exceeds its budget. It is usually added by the company’s management and is not under the manager’s control. Contingency reserves are part of the cost baseline. Risk and sponsor reserves are made-up terms.



Question 7:
The project manager has worked with an expert project team to estimate the project’s cost. The project manager is very confident that the project will end at that budget. Where should the project manager document his or her confidence level of the cost estimate?   
Ans:
The basis of the estimates will have an indication of the confidence level of the final estimate. No other choice will document the confidence level of an estimate.


Question 8:
When determining the budget for a project, what tool should the project manager use to sum the cost of each work package to form the entire project budget? 
Ans:
Cost aggregation is when you take the work packages and aggregate their individual cost to find the entire project budget. Data analysis does not contain any cost segregation, and neither does decision making. WBS aggregation is a made-up term.



Question 9:
The project manager has just been told by the project sponsor that, due to a current recession in the stock market, the company will not be able to allocate all of the funds that the project will need for completion. What should the project manager do with this funding limit? 
Ans:
In the process of determining budget, the funding limit reconciliation tool is handled by rescheduling work. Implementing a change request may not help, since the organization will not have the money; closing the project will not resolve the funding problems; and seeking external funding may not be an option.



Question 10:
The project manager has completed the process of determining budget. He has created the cost baseline, which will be added to the project management plan. The project manager is also aware of the project budget. What is the difference between the project budget and cost baseline?     
Ans:
The cost baseline includes the cost of all activities, plus the contingency reserves, and the management reserves includes the cost baseline, plus the management reserves.



Question 11:
In the process of control costs, the project manager compares the project management plan with what other information?  
Ans:
In almost all monitoring and controlling processes, the project manager compares the project plan with the work performance data to determine if the project is on track.


Question 12:
The project manager is currently evaluating how well the project is meeting the project budget. What earned value formula will be needed to determine if a project is on or over budget?   
Ans:
To determine if a project is on or over budget, you will need to calculate the CV or CPI, both of which use the AC value.


Question 13:
The budget manager has completed the earned value analysis for the project. He has concluded that the CPI of the project is .9. Which of the following statements best describes this project? 
Ans:
The cost performance index (CPI) is a measurement of the cost efficiency of the budgeted resources. The number being one represents the project being on budget. A number below one illustrates the project being over budget. At .9, the project is 10% over budget.



Question 14:
The project manager has calculated the EV of the project to be $14,000 and the PV to be $16,000. The BAC is currently at $22,000. Which statement best describes this project?   
Ans:
If you are to calculate this project’s SV, you would have gotten a negative number. To calculate the SV, subtract PV from EV, which is $14,000-$16,000 = -$2,000. This project is behind schedule by $2,000 worth of work.



Question 15:
While working on a multinational project with a budget of $90,000, the team has completed the design aspect of the project. You have calculated that the AC is $30,000 and the EV is $32,000. What is the EAC of this project?   
Ans:
To find out the EAC, you will need the BAC and CPI. You currently have the BAC, which is $90,000. The CPI is equal to EV/AC = $32,000/$30,000 = $1.06. So, the EAC is equal to $90,000/$1.06 = $84,906.




Question 16:
When creating the cost baseline, the project manager uses an S-curve graph to represent the baseline. Which of the following statements is true about the S-curve?   
Ans:
The S-curve is a time phase view of the cost baseline, which typically shows the budget versus the actual amount spent on the project.



Question 17:
Which one of the following is FALSE about TCPI?   
Ans:
TCPI calculates the performance that must be achieved to meet financial or schedule goals and determines the status of the remaining work with respect to the remaining funds. If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline plan, all future work must be performed AT the TCPI to achieve the planned BAC.


Question 18:
Earned Value Management (EVM) would NOT be very beneficial in which situation?   
Ans:
Earned value analysis provides a means by which to determine cost and schedule variances, not to develop the project cost baseline.


Question 19:
While developing complex software, the project manager decided to bill the company by how many lines of codes it will take to write the software. What type of estimate best describes this scenario?   
Ans:
Parametric estimating uses mathematical models based on historical records from other projects. It utilizes the statistical relationship that exists between a series of historical data and a particular delineated list of other variables.



Question 20:
Which of the following statements would be considered false about a project that has an SPI of 1.2 and the CPI of .7?
Ans:
Of the choices, the only answer that could be incorrect would be that the project is being fast tracked, since fast tracking generally results in a shorter schedule but does not affect costs. All other choices are 100% true, since the project is over budget but ahead of schedule.






Quiz 6: Quality Quiz
==============================================

Question 1:
A project manager working on a phone development project has met with the project team to determine the grade and quality of the product. The phone requires only basic functionality to be sold in emerging markets. What should the quality and grade be for the project?   
Ans:
All project deliverables should be high quality but not necessarily high grade. A low-grade product will not have as much functionality as a high-grade product. This question asks about a low-functionality product.




Question 2:
The project manager has met with the project team to determine when to do the inspections on the project. The project manager would like to do minimal inspections but still have a high-quality product. Which of the following actions would lead to fewer inspections but higher quality?   
Ans:
Quality is about prevention. The more a defect is prevented, the fewer inspections will be needed. For example, hiring a well-trained programmer would require fewer code inspections.



Question 3:
Which of the following statements about quality management is false?   
Ans:
It is always more expensive to let the customers find defects. This can lead to warranty issues, recalls, or loss of reputation. All of the other choices are true.



Question 4:
While working on a product redesign project, the project manager has met with the company’s senior management to inform them that they need to provide adequate resources to ensure the product’s quality. Which of the following statements is true about management’s responsibility regarding quality?   
Ans:
Management is responsible for quality throughout the organization in operations and project management.



Question 5:
The company has informed all company employees that they must pay careful attention to the work that they are doing to ensure the company delivers a quality product. What quality management theory best illustrates this scenario?
Ans:
Total quality management (TQM) is when everyone in the company is responsible for quality in the underlying process of how a product is made.


Question 6:
The project team has met with the project manager to develop the quality management plan and the quality metrics. What project documents contain the product quality requirements that the team would use to create quality metrics? 
Ans:
The requirements documentation includes the project and the product quality requirements. The requirements management plan will document how to manage the project requirements, and the traceability matrix will show the origin of the requirements.




Question 7:
While developing a smart phone, the project team has decided to look at other smart phones in the market to see how fast they start. The team members know that to be competitive, they will need to meet the startup times of the smart phones currently on the market. What tool would best help the project team in this scenario?   
Ans:
Benchmarking is a tool used to compare the standards of comparable projects or products. This can include meeting certain parameters that are industry specific.



Question 8:
While planning a project’s quality, the project team has identified certain costs that would need to be included in the project budget, such as testing, inspections, and having the right equipment to do the job. What best describes these costs?   
Ans:
The cost of quality includes the cost of conformance, which usually includes prevention costs, such as training, equipment, appraisal costs, testing, and inspections. The nonconformance cost includes reworking, scrapping, and the loss of business. All other choices are made-up terms.



Question 9:
The project team would like to document the sequence of steps that the process should follow to ensure that the deliverables are being made with the correct quality requirements. What tool can best help the team show the sequence of steps and whether there’s any room for improvement in a given process?
Ans:
A flowchart is sometimes called a process diagram, which can display the sequence of steps a given process will follow. Process charts and process improvement charts are made-up terms. The cost of quality examines the conformance and nonconformance cost of quality.



Question 10:
After a brainstorming session, the team members have accumulated a lot of different ideas that they can use to ensure the development of a good quality product. Their next step is to organize this information in a visual chart to make it easier for other stakeholders to understand. What method can best help the team?
Ans:
Mind mapping is a method used to visually organize information. A flowchart can display the sequence of the steps that the process will follow. The critical path method is used to find the minimum duration on a network diagram. An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a cause and effect diagram, shows the reasons for potential cause.




Question 11:
The project’s team members have documented what quality standards are to be used on the project and the different roles and responsibilities for quality management on the project. What project component will store this information?   
Ans:
The quality management plan includes the quality standards to be used on the project, the quality objectives of the project, and the quality roles and responsibilities.




Question 12:
What in quality management describes a project or product attribute and how the quality control process will verify compliance to it?
Ans:
Quality metrics specifically describe a project or product attribute and how the control quality process will verify compliance to it. Examples can include a task completed on time, the failure rate, or the number of defects identified per day.




Question 13:
Manage quality is a process that is done to increase the probability of meeting a project’s quality requirements. From what other process does manage quality get the data needed to improve quality management?   
Ans:
The manage quality process uses the data and results from the control quality process to ensure that the quality is being improved and met.



Question 14:
When managing project quality, what process does the project manager follow to ensure that the processes the project adheres to will produce a quality deliverable?   
Ans:
Manage quality is a process that improves the quality management processes the project will follow to produce a quality deliverable. It uses data from the control quality process, in particular, the quality control measurements.




Question 15:
While working for a large, multinational project, the project manager meets with the project sponsor to talk about managing quality on the project. The sponsor would like to know whose job it is to manage the quality on the project. What should the project manager’s response be?  
Ans:
Managing quality is considered to be everybody’s job, including the project manager, project team, project sponsor, and the management of the performing organization—even the customers are involved.



Question 16:
The project team is having a difficult time identifying the main cause of the quality defects in the deliverables. What tool can best help the project team identify the reason(s) for these defects?   
Ans:
An Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram, is used to help identify the causes of problems. Histograms are bar charts that can show frequencies, and a matrix diagram will help show a relationship in a process. A scatter diagram will show the relationship between two variables.


Question 17:
The organization’s senior management is not happy with the quality of the project deliverables so far. They have decided that an audit on the project’s quality management is necessary. Who would best be selected to conduct the quality audit?
Ans:
Quality audits are best done by a team external to the project. This ensure that there are no conflicts of interest during the audit and that the results are objective.




Question 18:
While designing a product, senior management informed the project manager that the product should be cost-effective, as the product will be sold in a developing country. What technique could the project managers use to ensure that the product’s design is cost-effective?   
Ans:
Designed for X is a technique that can be used to help design a product for a particular characteristic. In this example, it’s designed for cost, in which case the product would be designed to be cost-effective. X is a variable that can stand for reliability, deployment, assembly, cost, or safety.





Question 19:
The deliverables of the project have been completed, and the project team has decided to inspect the product to ensure that it has met the quality requirements. What process will the team use to inspect the deliverable for quality requirements?
Ans:
Control quality ensures that the deliverables have met the quality requirements by inspecting them. Manage quality ensures that the quality management processes are being met and improved on. Plan quality management creates the quality management plan and describes the quality metrics. Perform quality assurance is not a PMBOK process.



Question 20:
The project manager has met the project team, and they have created a control chart to determine whether the quality processes are stable and if it needs to be improved. They have taken a sample of 30 deliverables that are produced in a row and have identified that six of them are consecutively above the middle line between the upper and lower limits. What should the project team do next?
Ans:
A control chart follows the rule of seven, which specifies that there must be seven consecutive points above or below the middle line, which is the average of the data points, for the process to be out of control. If a process is out of control, then the project manager will need to implement specific actions to fix the process.

Question 1:
While managing a project, the project manager needs to be aware of the different types of resources on a project. Equipment, materials, facilities and infrastructure would be considered what type of resources?
Ans:
There are two types of resources on a project: team and physical resources. Team resources are the personnel who will work on the project, and physical resources are the things they will use to complete the work, such as equipment or materials. All other choices are not valid types of resources.



Question 2:
An organization has decided to use agile methods on their next project. How will the organization describe an agile project team?   
Ans:
In an agile project the team is self-organizing and the project manager will provide a supporting environment and trust that the team will do the job correctly.





Question 3:
To save money on a new project, the organization’s senior management has decided to use virtual teams instead of co-locating the entire project’s team. They have acquired the latest technology in audio and video conferencing. What is a potential issue that a virtual team might face?
Ans:
One challenge a virtual team will face is the possibility of feeling isolated, since most workers will generally work by themselves in an isolated place in their homes. Scheduling meetings can be done easily with technology. One major advantage of virtual teams is that a diverse set of experts can work on a project. Also, technology allows people with disabilities to easily communicate and work on projects.



Question 4:
The project team is using an assignment matrix, particularly a RACI chart. What is an important rule the team should use when using a RACI chart?   
Ans:
When using a RACI chart, one person must be held accountable for each activity listed on the chart.

Question 6:
Which stakeholders would be the best to create the team charter?   
Ans:
The team charter works best when the team helps develop it or at least has the ability to contribute to its creation, since it will outline acceptable behavior on the project.



Question 7:
Senior management and the project sponsor will hold a meeting about the current project in 2 days. They have requested a breakdown of the different resources that the project will use. What document should the project manager show during the meeting to display the resources by type?   
Ans:
The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type. The basis of estimate would show supporting details for why a particular resource was assigned to an activity. Resource requirements will describe what and how many resources are needed for each activity on the project.


Question 8:
Which of the following statements is false about the process of acquire resources?   
Ans:
The process of acquire resources is done throughout the project at certain intervals, as different resources are released and new resources join the project. All other statements are true.



Question 9:
The project management plan has been completed, and the project manager has just executed the project. His next task will be to select the team members to work on the project. What are some criteria  the project manager should be using when selecting team members?
Ans:
While they are many different criteria a project manager can use when selecting a team member, age and religion should not be one of them.



Question 10:
The project manager has assigned many resources to work on the project. Some team members will work on weekdays and a few on weekends. What should the project manager do next?
Ans:
Once team members have been assigned to the project, the project manager should create a resource calendar to show their availability while working on the project.

Question 12:
The project manager realizes that a lot of the team members are feeling isolated from each other. So, the project manager rents a meeting room where they can all get together and discuss a few of the project’s issues in a face-to-face setting. What tool is the project manager using?
Ans:
A colocation is a place where team members meet in the same physical location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. All other choices are made-up terms.



Question 13:
Project manager Mark does not believe that his team can complete the work without him inspecting the work throughout the project. His distrust of the project team has led to conflicts with different team members. What theory is Mark following to manage his team?
Ans:
Theory X is a theory that involves managers who distrust their workers and believe that people do not like to work and need to be managed consistently. They’re mostly known as micromanagers and can lead to poor team morale.




Question 14:
Project manager Mark has been assigned to the software development project. Mark has more than 20 years of experience as a software developer, and all of the team members are very happy that he is currently leading the team. They go to him for technical and management-related issues on the project. What form of power best describes Mark’s power on the project?
Ans:
Expert power is when the project manager is considered to be an expert in the field in which the project is taking place. The other choices are made-up forms of power.



Question 15:
While working with the project team, the project manager has been looking into the different strengths and weaknesses of the team as a whole and the individual members. He has found that some members are very strong as leaders and some members are strong in technical roles. What tool is the project manager currently using?   
Ans:
Individual and team assessment is used in the process of developing the team. It is done to gain insight into strengths and weaknesses for the team and its members.



Question 16:
While working on the product redesign project, the project manager has encountered different issues with the team members. He has been able to solve most of the issues between the team members while still working with other members to find solutions. What process is the project manager using?   
Ans:
The process of manage team is about tracking team members’ performance, providing feedback, and resolving issues. Develop team is about bringing the team together and ensuring that members work together efficiently. Acquire resources is done throughout the project to acquire the different team and physical resources needed to complete the project’s activities. Control resources is done to manage the physical resources for the project.



Question 17:
While working on the software development project, project manager Mary has encountered an issue between Mark, the lead programmer, and Peter, the designer. Peter notes that the way that Mark is programming the application means it will not work in a production environment. What should Mary do next?
Ans:
When a project manager encounters an issue, the first step is to get as much information about the issue as possible before taking any kind of action. Taking action without first understanding an issue can lead to the wrong actions being taken.



Question 18:
While working on the network upgrade project, team members Bill and Mark have an issue regarding how to upgrade the routers and firewalls. Bill says both devices should have a certain configuration, while Mark says both devices need another set of configurations. The project manager has met with both of them, and after analyzing the issue, the only solution they came up with was to have Mark configure the router and bill configure the firewall. What conflict resolution best illustrates this solution?   
Ans:
Compromise is determining a solution in which both sides generally give up something to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This is known as a lose–lose situation.



Question 19:

Ans:
Leadership is the ability to lead a team and inspire members to do their jobs well. Conflict management is used to resolve issues between team members. Decision making is used to make decisions about what should come next on a project. Influencing is the ability to persuade individuals to take a position on something.



Question 20:
While managing a small office renovation project, the project manager is disappointed that the team is misusing the physical resources available to them. They seem to be overusing the resources, leading to a cost increase on the project, to purchase more resources. What process did the project manager fail to perform since the project was executed?   
Ans:
Control resources is the process of ensuring that the physical resources that are assigned to the project are being utilized as planned. In this scenario, it seems that the project manager failed to perform this process after the start of the project, which led to the team incorrectly utilizing physical resources. Acquire resources is an executing process that is used to acquire the team and physical resources. Manage and develop resources are not actual PMBOK processes.

Ans:
The risk breakdown structure is part of the risk management plan, and it shows the different categories of risk on a project.

Ans:
During the process of identify risks, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to help identify individual project risks. This will lead to a more thorough risk register and include perspectives from all people affected by the project.



Question 9:
The project team is currently doing data analysis to help identify which risks can affect the project. What data analysis technique can they use to help determine if there are certain risks in the procurement agreement that can affect the project?   
Ans:
Document analysis is a structured review of the different project documents that could include contracts, agreements, and different parts of the project plan.




Question 10:
The project team has started to identify risks on the project. What method can they best use to identify both positive and negative risks while analyzing how strengths may offset threats and vice versa?   

Ans:
The SWOT analysis is done to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a project. This strengths and opportunities are positive risks, and the weaknesses and threats are the negative risks. By putting this into a quadrant diagram, the project team can see how strengths may offset threats, and vice versa.




Question 11:
The project team members have finished identifying risks up to this point in the project. They have created the risk register, which lists all of the individual project risks. What should the team create next?
Ans:
The risk report is generally created with the risk register or after the risk register. It includes information on the sources of overall project risks and a summary of information on the identified individual project risks.




Question 12:
The project manager has met with the legal department within the organization to be informed of a new regulation that was recently passed that may impact the project. The project manager has added this risk to the risk register. What process should the project manager do next?   
ans:
Once a risk has been identified, the next step is to determine how the risks will impact the project. This can be done by either doing a qualitative and/or a quantitative analysis. Sometimes, these two analyses are done sequentially, in which case a qualitative analysis is done followed by a quantitative analysis, or they can be done in parallel. Do not respond to a risk if you do not understand how the risk will impact the project.





Question 13:
The project team members are reviewing the risk in the risk register to determine which risks will have the greatest impact on a project. One risk in particular has a very high impact but the team has determined that this risk should be ranked very low on the project. What statement best describes why this risk is ranked so low?   
Ans:
It is very likely that some risks may have a high impact and a low probability, which will lead to the risk being ranked very low. An example is an earthquake in New York City. The impact may be high, but the probability of it occurring may be very low, which leads to the risk being ranked lower.




Question 14:
The project team members are currently doing the process of perform qualitative risk analysis. They would like to use a tool that could not only display the probability of the risks or impact but the overall likelihood of the risks. What tool can be used to display the three parameters?     
Ans:
A bubble chart is part of the tool data representation. It is used to display three dimensions of data. All other choices may only displays two dimensions.






Question 15:
While conducting a brainstorming session with the team in order to rank the risks, the project manager is worried about the data the team is using to rank the risks. The project manager feels that some team members may only be speculating about what the probability of a risks would be. What tool can best help the project manager in this scenario?
Ans:
Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about the individual risks is accurate and reliable. If this data is not accurate then the entire assessment may be compromised and will not truly reflect the risk ranking on a project.












Question 16:
The project manager and team has determined that if a flood were to take place during the building renovation project, it would delay the project by 2 weeks and cost approximately $50,000 in damages. What process did the project manager and team complete to collect these data?
Ams:
Quantitative risk analysis is a numerical analysis of how the risk will impact the project. This is in contrast to a qualitative analysis, which would just rank the risks from the most important to the least important. The project team did not come up with a response to the flood risks in this scenario, so the choice cannot be to plan a risk response. Identify risk is used to create the risk register, and a risk report does not evaluate the risks.



Question 17:
The project team has identified, ranked, and determined how the risks will impact the project. One risk in particular is a new regulation that may pass and could have a severe effect on the project and on the entire organization. What risk response strategy would be best for the team to take?  
Ans:
Since this is a risk that will not just affect the project but the entire organization, the project team should escalate the risk toward a portfolio or the organization level. Let the organization’s legal department communicate with the project manager and determine how to respond.






Question 18:
The project team members are coming up with ways to respond to an opportunity that they feel will not likely happen. The opportunity is that the permit for the building renovation project comes earlier than its supposed six-week wait. Since the permit office is so backed up, the project team members have decided that if the permit does come earlier than 6 weeks, they will still start the work in 6 weeks. What risk response strategy does this illustrate?   
Ans:
success alert
Good job!
Acceptance of an opportunity is to take no proactive action before it happens. In this scenario, the team is making no proactive response. If the permit comes earlier, the team will still start the work in the 6 weeks that it would take for the permit to come normally.



Question 19:
While working on a 60-story skyscraper project, one supplier has informed the project manager that due to dangerous weather at the warehouse, the materials will be anywhere 1 to 2 months late. The project manager has already accounted for this risk and has decided to go with another supplier to get the materials. What process best illustrates this scenario?  
Ans:
In this scenario, the project manager is implementing the risk response. The project manager is not trying to identify risks or plan a response.


Question 20:
During the process of monitor risks, the project manager works with the organization to determine the effectiveness of the risk management processes. They have determined that the risk processes for the project are adequate and that no changes should be made. What tool best describes this?   
Ams:
