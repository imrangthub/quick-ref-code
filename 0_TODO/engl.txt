"We use an automated CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins. 
Whenever a service needs to be deployed to production or the test environment, we use this pipeline to ensure smooth and consistent deployments."


"In our Java Spring Boot services, we use @ControllerAdvice for centralized error and exception handling. 
Additionally, we sometimes use try-catch blocks manually to handle specific exceptions in our code."


"Our DB team usually handles query optimization and other database-related tasks. 
As a backend developer, I collaborate with them to ensure efficient queries and help determine the best solution for our services or specific business requirements. 
Although I do not work directly on the database, I have a good understanding of RDS, including how it works, 
the purpose of tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, and the use of DML and DDL commands."



"In our service, we have a proper logging and monitoring system. Based on the logs and alerts, we quickly analyze production issues. 
For example, we may receive alerts that a host’s storage is full, integrations or databases are responding slowly, or service-to-service communication fails.
We use this information to identify the root cause and take appropriate action to resolve the problem."



"When I reach the office, I keep my bag on the table, go to the washroom to freshen up, drink two glasses of water, 
and then sit in my chair to start work, following my to-do list."


"I’m very proud of my current project because I’m the technical lead here.
and, taking complete ownership of the entire system, managing it both technically and strategically.
I consistently support my team with the guidance they need.
and Really, This is a robust, scalable excellent solution that runs smoothly on production.
Because of this, I am proud of my contribution to this project and my current role."


"Currently, I’m working as a Lead Software Engineer.
My goal is to become a Principal Software Engineer within the next two years, and then move into Architect role within the next three years.
So overall, my target is to become a skilled software Architect within the next five years."


"We usually manage our day-to-day project tasks using JIRA, and we hold daily stand-up meetings to stay aligned with the team.
I also maintain a personal to-do list to organize my all daily activities — including office tasks, family responsibilities, and personal errands.
This helps me stay focused and manage my time more efficiently throughout the day"



“On weekends, I like to spend time with my family, especially my children, and I usually do that.
Sometimes, I hang out with my friends.
On some weekends, I get invitations from my relatives or colleagues.
So, I join their gatherings and enjoy the time.
This is how I enjoy my weekends.”



"I’m currently working on a telco-based microservices solution that handles around 40 million requests per day.
I serve as a Lead Engineer, taking complete ownership of the entire system and managing it both technically and strategically.
Our core technology stack includes Java and Spring, especially Spring Cloud for building the microservices.
We also use OAuth2, Redis, Kafka, Jenkins,Grafana/Loki  Nginx more.
Overall, we work with a range of modern technologies across different parts of the project."



"In our team, we follow clear documentation, rules, and processes.
Because of this, most day-to-day and ongoing tasks run smoothly without requiring constant supervision.

When we receive a Change Request (CR) from the business team, we analyze and break down the requirements.
Once the implementation plan is clear, I assign the task to the most suitable and available team member.

If any technical challenge arises, either during a CR or in an ongoing project—and the assigned team members are unable to solve it, 
I take it over, analyze the issue, and work on the solution myself.

Additionally, when new technologies or unfamiliar tools are required in a project, I take the lead. 
I evaluate the technology, and how it fits with our system.
If it meets our needs, I test and implement it myself like a POC Project.

This is how I support my team both technically and strategically."



"Yes, I have been working with Agile methodology for the last five years.
In my current project, we use Agile practices to build and deploy all deliverables efficiently."



"To ensure quality in our project, we follow several key strategies.
we write clean and reusable code and ensure all team members follow standard coding practices.
We also perform code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
Additionally, we implement automated testing tools for unit tests and integration tests using the latest tools and technologies.
This is how I help ensure code and software quality in my projects."

"Are there any features or functionalities in your current system that you or other users no longer use, 
r any reports that you consider obsolete because they don’t provide business value?"


"Can you share the process of your data synchronization? For example, when a real-world event happens—like a user posting a comment on a 
Facebook page, a YouTube channel, sending a Messenger message, or an email—how quickly does this data appear in your system? Is it real-time,
 or does it take some time before it becomes visible in your system?"


"Could you describe the user access management in your current system? Specifically, how do you add a user and assign particular permissions? 
What types of users and permissions exist in your system, and how are permissions created and assigned to their roles? 
Additionally, if a user has access to multiple channels, how is their permission managed? 



"Could you describe the types of reports available in your current system? How many different report types do you require from this system? 
How frequently are these reports generated—daily, weekly, monthly, or annually? 
Are they produced at fixed intervals or generated on-demand? 
Additionally, could you explain the reporting mechanism, including how reports are created, accessed, and downloaded, as well as their intended purpose?"



"Mr. Asif, how many media channels are already integrated into your system, 
and are they all working? Do you frequently need to add or remove media? 
Also, is there any requirement to temporarily disable a channel or media for a specific period and then enable it again? Or do you frequently need to add or delete media?"



"Mr. Asif, is the service running 24 hours a day, or is there any scheduled downtime? Does the system operate continuously, or is it only available during certain hours?"


"Could you please describe what kind of business logic and requirements you expect from this new application?"

"Ok, Mr. Asif, could you please describe in more detail the user module and user journey? For example, 
how do you add a user, assign roles, and what types of users will the new system have? Also, how do they log in—do they need to register themselves, or will the users be added directly into the system?"



"Mr. Asif, can you please share which module in your system is used the most by users? Which module or feature sees the busiest activity, such as a dashboard or reporting tool? How frequently do users log in and log out? Could you describe a bit more about the busiest module in your system?"





================================================
"Yes, there was a situation when I had to quickly build a CI/CD pipeline for our project.
We use a microservice architecture, so as traffic increases, we need to add more cluster nodes, making deployment more complex.
Therefore, we required an automated CI/CD pipeline to simplify deployment.
I took responsibility for building this pipeline and quickly learned how to create and implement it using Jenkins."



"Last month, I solved a problem under pressure when a service started returning 404 errors to client requests. 
I got a call from our manager and quickly analyzed the logs. 
I found that NGINX had old configurations from a previous CR deployment, and a junior developer had not properly updated the Git repository. 
When the configurations synced across the Active-Active nodes, it caused the issue. 
I fixed it promptly and restored the service within half an hour. This prevented downtime and satisfied our manager and stakeholders."



"I have strong analytical skills that allow me to break down complex systems, design effective solutions, and ensure successful implementation."


"To keep myself up to date with the latest technology, I use several strategies.
I read the latest technical journals, online portals, and various technology news sites.
I also join several groups and communities on LinkedIn and GitHub to stay informed and connected."


"I have a strong technical foundation and many years of experience in the tech industry.
I remind myself that I have already dealt with a lot of challenges before.
So, I motivate myself to keep going, not give up, and believe that I will find the solution.
If I cannot solve it, who else can? If somebody is able to solve it, then I can too."


"When I face tight deadlines or pressure at work, I stay calm and focused.
First, I break the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and prioritize them.
I communicate clearly with my team and stakeholders to set realistic expectations and distribute tasks effectively.
If needed, I ask my team for help to handle extra work while ensuring quality.
This is how I manage my tasks under pressure."










================================================
"When a team member and I have different opinions on a technical approach, I first listen carefully to their perspective to understand their reasoning. 
Then, I explain my approach and the benefits of it. 
We discuss the pros and cons of both approaches and try to reach a common solution that is best for the project. 
If needed, we consult documentation or seek advice from a senior engineer to make a final decision."


"I welcome feedback from my manager and peers because it helps me improve.
When I receive feedback, I listen carefully without interrupting and try to understand their perspective.
I ask questions if I need clarification.
Then, I take the feedback positively and work on the areas where I can improve.
I also thank them for their input and follow up to show that I’m applying their suggestions."


"When I have multiple deadlines, I prioritize my tasks using the categories: must-have, could-have, and nice-to-have.
Based on this, I create a timeline and make a to-do list to organize my work efficiently.
Then, I start working on the most critical tasks first to meet deadlines effectively."


"When conflicts arise within my team, I address them promptly through open and respectful communication.
I listen carefully to all sides to understand the root cause of the conflict.
Then I analyze the situation and consider everyone’s views to find a common solution.
Finally, I make the decision that brings the maximum benefit to our project and company.
I share this decision with all team members to help convince them that it is the best way forward."
