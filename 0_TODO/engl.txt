Daily Plan (15–30 minutes/day)
================================================
5 min: Talk 2–3 minutes to yourself in English — about what you’ll do today.
10 min: Listen & shadow a podcast/video
10 min: Speak/record on a topic
At night, record 1-minute diary in English (just your voice).

“On weekends, I like to spend time with my children and family, and I usually do that.
Sometimes, I hang out with my friends.
On some weekends, I get invitations from my relatives or colleagues.
So, I join their gatherings and enjoy the time.
This is how I enjoy my weekends.”




"I’m currently working on a telco-based microservices solution that handles around 40 million requests per day.
Our core technology stack includes Java and Spring, especially Spring Cloud for building the microservices.
We also use Redis, Kafka, and Jenkins for CI/CD.
Overall, we work with a range of modern technologies across different parts of the project."





"I always try to deploy and release features within a short time when needed.
Although our system is highly secure and follows proper monitoring and auto-scaling, we still occasionally face issues.
Sometimes, an external integration may go down, or one of our services may get overloaded and start throwing errors.
In such cases, we act quickly to identify the root cause and resolve the problem as soon as possible.



"In our team, we follow clear documentation, rules, and processes.
Because of this, most day-to-day and ongoing tasks run smoothly without requiring constant supervision.
When we receive a Change Request (CR) from the business team, we analyze and break down the requirements.
Once the implementation plan is clear, I assign the task to the most suitable and available team member.

If any technical challenge arises—either during a CR or in an ongoing project—and the assigned team members are unable to solve it, I take it over, analyze the issue, and work on the solution myself.

Additionally, when new technologies or unfamiliar tools are required in a project, I take the lead.
I evaluate the technology, its purpose, and how it fits with our system.
If it meets our needs, I test and implement it myself before introducing it to the team.

This is how I support my team both technically and strategically."

Public & Professional Confidence Trick:

Prepare 10 fallback phrases you can use in any meeting or public talk.
Examples:
    “That’s a great question, let me explain…”
    “From my experience working on [project]...”
    “To summarize, we should focus on…”
Speak slower, use hand gestures — don’t rush. People will respect you more.
