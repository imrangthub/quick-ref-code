##relocation
================================================

I'm a Java + Spring Boot developer with 7 years of experience, currently based in Bangladesh. 
I'm actively seeking opportunities with companies that support visa sponsorship and relocation to the USA, Canada, UK, or Europe.
I’ve worked on scalable microservices, RESTful APIs, cloud-native apps (AWS), and Kafka. 
I'd love to bring that experience to your team.

Could we connect to explore if there's a fit?

Daily Plan (15–30 minutes/day)
================================================
5 min: Think aloud (mirror talk)
10 min: Listen & shadow a podcast/video
10 min: Speak/record on a topic
5 min: Note mistakes & learn better phrases





================================================
💥 💥 💥 must-have formula — here it is.
================================================
S - Speak out loud daily (no excuses)
P - Practice real situations (work, meetings, interviews)
E - Expand vocabulary & sentence patterns
A - Actively listen & mimic native tone
K - Know your mistakes & fix them weekly



🔐 Your Non-Negotiable Daily Routine (30 minutes):
================================================
Time	Task
10m	    Mirror Talk – Talk about your day/work. No Bengali. Full English.
10m	    Listening + Shadowing – Watch 3-5 mins of a professional speaker. Repeat exactly with tone.
5m	    Record Yourself – Answer: “What did I do today?” or “How do I solve a problem?”
5m	    Note 3 mistakes or weak points – Write better sentences next to them.


🎯 Weekly Must-Do:
================================================
Every Friday: Shadow a TED speaker for 10 mins.
Every Saturday: Simulate a meeting or interview (with a friend or AI).

Public & Professional Confidence Trick:
================================================
Prepare 10 fallback phrases you can use in any meeting or public talk.
Examples:
    “That’s a great question, let me explain…”
    “From my experience working on [project]...”
    “To summarize, we should focus on…”
Speak slower, use hand gestures — don’t rush. People will respect you more.
Smile + Eye contact — even if grammar isn't perfect, confidence sells your English.
