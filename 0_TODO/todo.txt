The 90/90/1 Rule:

Host: To start, could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background in software engineering?


Hi this is Imran and I'm a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in the field. 
I graduated with Degree in computer science as well as a master's 
and started my career as a software developer at a startup company.
Since then, I've worked at a few different companies, focusing on web development and backend systems.

Imran: Sure, I graduated with a degree in computer science and started my career as a software developer 
at a startup. Since then, I've worked at a few different companies, focusing on web development 
and backend systems. I'm always interested in learning new technologies and improving my skills.

MyPassion comes from for SoftwareEngineering to Create UsefulSolutions that Make people's lives easier.
I love-to taking the Challenge of ComplexProblems and Breaking it down into Manageable pieces, 
and then Using my SkillsToBuild an Effective and Efficient Solutions.


On my career journey, I am working with many small and big distribution solutions with many people 
and it made me a good team player.
I understand the importance of good communication, both within the 
team and with stakeholders outside of the engineering department. 
I'm always willing to listen to other people's ideas and collaborate to find the best solution.

Imran: One of the most challenging projects I worked on was building a scalable backend system 
for a social media app. We had to deal with a large volume of data and a lot of concurrent users. 
To approach the problem, we broke it down into smaller pieces and worked on each piece iteratively. 
We also used load testing to make sure our system could handle the expected traffic. 
It was a lot of work, but we were able to successfully launch the app and scale it up as needed.


I love this job, and I'm excited to continue my journey in software engineering.
Thank you for taking the time to watch my self-introduction video.
