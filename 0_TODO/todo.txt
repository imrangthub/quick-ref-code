I heard about your resigning a few days early I didn't think too much about it. 
When you declared it officially it hart me, I couldn't take it that you leaving us.

Just one thing to say You are not a boss you are a leader, Not a commander a follower. wish to meet with you again.

Praying for you and your family, pray for us too.
May Allah bless us all with health and happy life.
