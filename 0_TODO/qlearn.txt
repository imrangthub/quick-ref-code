Interviewer: Can you walk us through your process for debugging a complex issue in your code?

    Interviewee: Sure, I usually start by looking at the error message and trying to understand what went wrong. 
    Which layer raises this problem, is it from front-end backend persistence layers or any other cases?
    From there, I'll review the code and try to reproduce the issue. 
    If I can't reproduce it, I'll start adding logging statements to track down the problem. 
    Once I have a better understanding of the issue, I'll start testing potential solutions and iterating until 
    I find the root cause and fix it.


Interviewer: Can you tell us about a particularly challenging project you've worked on and how you approached it?

    Interviewee: Sure, I worked on a  Microservice Solution with 40+ services, Its a learge scalable backend system 
    for a Leading Telco Company here we had to deal with a huge number of traffic, concurrency deployment with Zero dwontime. 
    It was a lot of work, but we were able to successfully launch the Solution and scale it up as needed.
    Technology uses: Java, Spring-cloud.

    We also had to ensure that the microservice was resilient to failures and could recover quickly in case of any issues. 
    This involved implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system that could detect issues and notify us immediately.
    Like: Memory uses, CPU uses, ErrorRate, RttSucessRate etc.

    We also had to perform regular load testing and capacity planning to make sure that the microservice 
    could handle the expected load and scale as needed.



Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging project. How did you handle communication with the stakeholders 
and the team members?

    Interviewee: Communication was critical for the success of the project. 
    We held regular meetings with the stakeholders to get feedback and clarify requirements. 
    We also had to work closely with the product team to make sure that the developing solution met their needs.

    For the technical discussions, we held regular team meetings to review progress and discuss any technical 
    challenges. We used various collaboration tools such as Slack and Jira to track progress and assign tasks. 
    We also made sure that we had clear documentation and shared our progress with the stakeholders regularly.




Interviewer: Impressive. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in software engineering?

    Interviewee: I'm a big believer in continuous learning, so I make a point to attend industry conferences and

    We also had to work within tight deadlines and make sure that all team members were on the same page. 
    To handle this, I made sure that we had regular team meetings and used project management tools to

#Induction Meeting for online Instructor
-------------------------------------------------
I am a professional, working in the corporate environment for the last 6 years.

If everything passes well, If we are able to deliver our service properly then we both will be benefited.
To achieve that it is my responsibility to follow the company rules and policies. 
So it will be no issue.

And also
When you assign me to a course or class, please let me know as soon as possible.
Or We can take a short discussions before starting the course.
Because I have to manage my time for ensure my availability and have to be mentally prepared for it.



In my experience I find that, every training center has different approach to delivery their course.
They offer different subject with variety of delivery methods for a single subject. 
For example CoursesOfJava, they offer long courses, short courses sometimes workshops asPer needs of the students.
Same topic with different time duration. 

So here What is the plan for it?
Do you have a course curriculum or how do you manage students during the course?

I have a course syllabus for my subject, that mentions which topics will be covered in which course and its duration. 
Like: CoreJava courses are about 60 hours-long, and it's covered this this topics.
It's a general syllabus and it's customizable.
Usually, it is shared with the students at the beginning of the course.
For Given an idea to students of how many hours we will spend on which topic and when-until we will complete this course.

So here What is the plan for it?
I don't know whether it shared to the students from your site or whether I have to do that.
And if it DoneBy from your site, please align me with that information like: course syllabus. 
Because we have to be on the same page front of the students.
