The 90/90/1 Rule:

The 90/90/1 Rule (90 Days, 90 Minutes, 1 Goal), introduced by Robin Sharma, 
recommends allocating 90 minutes every day for the next 90 days to work on the top goal that we want to achieve. 
This template helps you identify that goal and track your progress over the 90 day period.

Software Engineer interview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: Hi there, thank you for coming in today. 
Can you tell us a little bit about your background and experience as a software engineer?

    Interviewee: Sure, I'm a SoftwareEngineer with 6years+ Experience. 
    I Graduated with a Degree In ComputerScience as well as a Master's 
    and Started my career as a SoftwareEngineer in 2017, - Janurary 2017.
    and focusing on web development and backend systems.

    Since then, I haved worked at few different Companies, with many Technologies.
    Like: CloudComputing, Docker, Kubernetes, Java, Spring, PHP, dirrerent type of RDS and so on. 
    Recently, I had Complete AWS C03 Certification exam.



Interviewer: Great. Can you walk us through your process for debugging a complex issue in your code?

    Interviewee: Sure, I usually start by looking at the error message and trying to understand what went wrong. 
    Which layer raises this problem, is it from front-end backend persistence layers or any other cases?
    From there, I'll review the code and try to reproduce the issue. 
    If I can't reproduce it, I'll start adding logging statements to track down the problem. 
    Once I have a better understanding of the issue, I'll start testing potential solutions and iterating until 
    I find the root cause and fix it.



Interviewer: Can you tell us about a particularly challenging project you've worked on and how you approached it?

    Interviewee: Sure, I worked on a  Microservice Solution with 40+ services its a kind of challengeing project, 
    Its a scalable backend system for a Leading Telco Company here we had to deal with a large number of traffic, 
    concurrency deployment with Zero dwontime. .

    We also had to ensure that the microservice was resilient to failures and could recover quickly 
    in case of any issues. 
    This involved implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system that could detect issues and notify 
    us immediately.
    We also had to perform regular load testing and capacity planning to make sure that the microservice 
    could handle the expected load and scale as needed.



Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging project. How did you handle communication with the stakeholders 
and the team members?

    Interviewee: Communication was critical for the success of the project. 
    We held regular meetings with the stakeholders to get feedback and clarify requirements. 
    We also had to work closely with the product team to make sure that the developing solution met their needs.

    For the technical discussions, we held regular team meetings to review progress and discuss any technical 
    challenges. We used various collaboration tools such as Slack and Jira to track progress and assign tasks. 
    We also made sure that we had clear documentation and shared our progress with the stakeholders regularly.




Interviewer: Impressive. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in software engineering?

    Interviewee: I'm a big believer in continuous learning, so I make a point to attend industry conferences and 
    read industry publications. 
    I also enjoy participating in online communities and attending meetups to stay connected 
    with other developers and learn from their experiences.
    I followed the thech github repository.



Interviewer: Can you tell us about a time when you had to collaborate with a team to complete a project
and how you handled it?

    Interviewee: Absolutely. My recent project, I was part of a team tasked with building a new feature for a 
    healthcare app. 
    We had to work closely with the product team to understand their requirements, and with the 
    QA team to ensure that the feature was tested thoroughly. 
    We also had to work within tight deadlines and make sure that all team members were on the same page. 
    To handle this, I made sure that we had regular team meetings and used project management tools to 
    track progress and assign tasks. 
    Communication was key in making sure that everyone was aware of what was happening and what needed to be done.

    As an experienced programmer, I wanted to share my knowledge with others who are interested in these fields.

    I also recognized that there is a growing demand for online technical education, 
    as it allows people to learn from anywhere in the world. from there own place.
    
    an another region:
    Even after finishing all my daily work, on average every-day I have about 2 or 3 more hours. 
    So I want to utilize the time. And wish to make some money from it.





Interviewer: That's a great motivation. What are some challenges you have faced as an online technical teacher?

    Interviewee: One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that students stay engaged and motivated throughout 
    the course. With online learning, there can be distractions and competing priorities, 
    so it's important to keep the students engaged and excited about what they are learning.

    Another challenge is ensuring that students have access to the necessary resources and tools for the course. 
    This can include software, hardware, and online resources, as well as technical support.

    Lastly, as an online technical teacher, it's important to be constantly learning and staying up-to-date with 
    the latest technologies and trends in the field.


Interviewer: That's very true. How do you keep your teaching content up-to-date and relevant?

    Interviewee: I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends by attending conferences, 
    reading technical articles and books, and participating in online communities. 
    I also regularly review and update my teaching content to ensure that it is relevant and up-to-date.

    I also try to incorporate real-world examples and case studies into my teaching, as this helps 
    students see the practical applications of the concepts they are learning.



Interviewer: That's great to hear. How do you ensure that your students are successful in their 
learning and achieve their goals?

    I also encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals and creating a personalized 
    learning plan. This can help them stay motivated and focused throughout the course.



Interviewer: How do you handel forgen student?

    When handling foreign students, I first make an effort to understand their cultural background and any potential 
    language barriers. This involves learning about their native language and customs, as well as their educational 
    background and experience.

    My goal is to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable 
    and engaged, regardless of their background or nationality.

#TEACHER CONVERSATION
=================================================


#Taking with Manager
-------------------------------------------------
Do you have any Cource curriculam ? or How you mange your student for cource time?


I have a course curriculum for my every subject with mentioned what topics are to be covered in which course and its time duration. 

Like: Java courses are about 60hours long. Usually it is shared with the students at the beginning of the course.
For Given an idea to students of how many hours we will spend on which topic and when-until we will complete this course.

I don't know whether your already inform the students about this or whether I will do that.


And if you do, please align me with that information. 
Because we have to be on the same page in front of the students.


When you will assigning me to any course or class please inform me as early as possible.
Because I have to manage my time for ensuring my availability and have to be mentally prepared for it.
