The 90/90/1 Rule:

The 90/90/1 Rule (90 Days, 90 Minutes, 1 Goal), introduced by Robin Sharma, 
recommends allocating 90 minutes every day for the next 90 days to work on the top goal that we want to achieve. 
This template helps you identify that goal and track your progress over the 90 day period.
