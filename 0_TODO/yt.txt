=================================================



1) Introduction
=================================================

00:00-to-00:40mm
================
1) StartngPeech:
    Hey there! Welcome to this tutorial on Docker.
    If you are new to Docker, and want to learn Docker from scratch you’re in the right place.

    In this tutorial, I'll explain Docker from the very beginning.
    What is docker, how this docker thing works, why it’s so popular, and definitely TheEasyWay!

    Each topic will be explained with hands-on exercises to make it clear and practical.
    We are gonna use different programming languages, such as  Java, Python, PHP javaScript for practice projects. 
    This will be more interesting and gain a clear understanding of 
    how docker deals with various programming languages.

    and finally, we will deploy a Three Tier application including frontend, backend and Database using docker.
    to get a clear picture.

    Really,
    By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of Docker and be ready to start using Docker in 
    real-world projects.
    So, grab your coffee, get comfortable, and let’s dive into the world of Docker!


00:40mm-to-00:50mm
==================
2) AboutDocuemnt:
    In this tutorial, I am gonna use this Document to organize the topic-resource, uses-commands, diagrams, screenshots, etc etc.
    and I will share it with you.
    The link of this Document will be available in the video description and first comment.
    And I will also share the GitHub link of the project and source code that will be used in this tutorial.
    


00:50mm-to-1:05mm
=================
3) 
You don’t have to be a programmer to learn Docker.
Anyone can learn Docker without coding skills.
actually, docker focuses on deployment and system management, not application development.



1:05mm-to-2:40mm
================
4) Introducing Tutorial Topics

Introduction
Just course Intro.


Docker Installation:
Here we Learn how to install Docker on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Set it up step-by-step to ensuring Docker runs smoothly on your system and get started quickly.

Getting Started with Docker
Run our first container and we will explore some basic commands. 
a HelloWorld thing of docker.
Get familiar with Docker’s key parts like images and containers.

Docker in Depth
Understand how Docker works behind the scenes. 
Learn about its components, engine, internal-architecture, and how it makes apps run faster.

Docker Images and Containers
a deep dive into Docker images and containers.
Learn how to create, manage, and optimize Docker images and containers for efficient application deployment.
Find out what images and containers are and how they’re different. 
Create, manage, and explore them in detail.

Storage and Volumes
Explore Docker's storage options for data persistence.
Learn about different types of volumes and mounting to manage container data effectively.

Networking and Security
Discover Docker's networking capabilities, type of network. 
Learn about how to create, manage Docker's network and 
how containers talk to each other and stay secure using this docker network.

Simple Example Project
Work on several simple hands-on projects using different programming languages 
and run them as Docker containers. including frontend backend and database.
This will reinforce key concepts and give you practical Docker experience.


Docker Compose
Set up and run multiple containers with one file using Docker Compose. 
Learn how to run multiple DockerContainer using a single command.
Like frontend backend and database all those will run using only a single command.
Waht is Simplify your workflows with YAML-based configuration files and Manage everything easily.

Container Orchestration
Understand the need for container orchestration and explore tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. 
Learn how to manage and scale containerized applications in production environments.


2:40mm-to-3:06
================
6) Which for This Course
This course is for DevOps professionals, app developers, software engineers, IT managers, 
and system architects. 
It’s also perfect for anyone interested in learning Docker.




2) Docker Installation | 10:44 sec
=================================================

00:00 -to- 
In this turoruL we see windows install step by stem

the officeal document show all type machine install ation.

The Binary/.exe/Software are we use to install docker its two type communication/enterprise
Some extra feature in enterprise edition have
Learning perpose Communication is good enought


Start download .exec
See System requirment 


exe download done
before install check hyperVisor,
Start installation, we go with hypervisor so we have to uncheck it

Next video we see linux installingojn
taking about web docker paractise platefrom : Play with Docker


Installation done, Resart the pc
Start Docker app from STarte Manu

Check Docker version using cmd/PowerShell
Next Video we will see this manue funcationality and uses 


recomandate to open account in hub.docker.com
Taking about image we can upload here, Officeal Image
Run a simple HelloWorld app/image


Check docker desktop app then in new we have no image and container here till now
Also check by command line this empty


Execute pull command of helloworld Image
First of all it pull image from docker.hub

Its pull done so t it have to show in docker desktop

then execute run command for and show then success message
show container seciton on docker app
check using power shell


LinuxInstallation | 8:44 sec
===========================================

We are going to inatall Docker in linux in thsi video
We can Install docker two way in linux: with DockerDesktop and withOut Desktop Just DocekrEnginx 

Officeal Document show different way wc can install docker in our machine 
teh best easy way is: we can download a script and run it

Download the script and we can do a dry-run is any issue it will show
then run the script as
this document shows diffeent way for different linxu distru

done installaton, check docker install status by chacking version
permission issue show, give permission 
then check container and image
Run a helloworld app


Show docker online docker platfrom (Play with docker)
You need a docker accoutn and login usngi this accoutn in play with docker
It will give you a Three hour session

Create a instance
Run a hellow world Appkication


This is enougnt for learnign perpose 
any type we app or we can run here with port access

Now we are giing to run nginx app here
I am using a port maping 8080 with  nginx defautl port 80
Donet worr now for this command we will descus all in details in detail later view
This docker officela image


Docuemnt show about this image, and how run it

Application run done wth 8080 port clieck it and it will show the defautl nginx page
So it just like my local machine we can continus our learning perpose here
its good enought

Next video we will explore then docjer basic comand






3) Getting Started with Dockers | 30:44 sec
===================================================

1:00mm
=========
Today video we will see docker basic command uses 
We can see this using dockr command line also in wndows then DockerDesktop also show this
but in professonally real-world project uses commanline mode, it will be for if you get habituate with  it


2:00 mm
Fists comamdn : dockdr information
this will shwo dockder current version
It show to information abotu current docker information

As it brand new installation so 0-container and 0-image here 
this is dockdr defautl network drive e
docker volume, system information will show here 


cms: docker ls 
Hre i give a short descriptin about this command 
run command, no image sohow in command line also desktopapp

Now we goung to pull hellowrold image 
check image, the command is: docker image ls
it will show the image as it pull theh image from docker hub
It also show usign ducer desktop  


3:40
===========
Now we run nginx image with port mapting 8080
docker run command do tow this at a time when it execute 
one: pull the image if it not alrady pull or present in you machine 
then run it

pull doe, it will show in image in command line also in desktop 
nothen in container seciton cos we dont run it YouTube

3:05mm
==============
Now run a contianer and show it in command line
talkabut: container id nema comand authgenerate container name
this how our container is running now with 8080 port if we opern 8080 port in my locatl machne 
we can see ntinx home pag
We can set our continer name, reather defautl aoutgenerate name 
also we descript in details this all part of thei command

if we see here show two contianer but we we run docker containe ls it show only one container
cos is contienr ls only show theh runing continer 
if we try to see all contienr in my machien run and sutdown then we use 
dockdr ps -A wht is show all container
now it show both contienr with runnign also what is exist
we cann delete it from here


8:40mm
=================
Now we see how to stop a continer
to stope a runing continer using command line we need the container id
and use stop command, and check it
to check exit containe we use dockr ps -A
to delete conteinr we use docker rm command, we cna use a few character retehr full contienr id
check and show no contener here alos desktop no contienrer shows
no container here but image still here, because docker contienr and Image is differet each other
here show all image what is we pull pevriosly

Image just like a class, its a read only file and we can run as many container as we need from this image
We cna run it agein a contener form this image, in this time we provide a contienr name
we provide -d for dirach mode of the command liine and prot maping finally image name
now then conteiner show it with our provided name ng-cont1 
we ging to run another contenr from this image

IF WE use a image namem with it not exit then it will not run, the message will show this message

chack the proper image also we have to provide available port for run it
if we use same port wht is already ocupid thei it will throw an error, we need to check thei port
same nema contaienr also not allows
we cna do delete preoviwou contienr or chage then name, we will sue ng-cont3


16:40
=======================
here a interesting fact, what problem solve tehn here is and exmaple 
Lools if we need to mutile ngin in my machine using nginx sofrwae itself 
then we need do update thie nginx-config file run it 
But using docker it jsut usitn a command only
This is then one of bigger problem solve by docker that: for multple app no need to copy ngin and update it
not underline host dependency jsut handel it using command


17:50
=====================
Dockr contienr run in a isolated mode each other, dont errect in alsoe in its how machine
underline technology as logn as the host machne has a docekr enginx running on it
How docker internal architecture work, how it manage contienr we well see in details in 
dockdr in depth section dont worry now
Now jsut we stick wtih docker basic command only 


18:40
===========================
docker exec comamdn
its a the command wht is go indes docker runnign conteinr and so some ops as we need
liek we going to chnage the update the nginx defautl page
How we do it ? this way 
thsi -it use to go inset ing pint my terminal inside the conteinr

now we ging to change thsi 8282 port runing nginx defautl page
wht conteinr command we have to use we will show it in imageand contienr secotion
Now i am insede in a conterr 
then conteinr runing with a linux destru we an see it runign cat on relaese file as



ok we gonna change nginx 8181 conrr ner home page 
for tis we need to exit form this contienr and enter indeid this contienr 
chek the contienr ner id and user it to do exec coamand


check this current defautl nginx page whti inde.html page inthis Pathology
we use echo commandn to update this
thsi conteinr actually a milimum version of linx destur anay of package isn not prest like vi or nationality
so we have to use echow here for now

update the file and check it useing cat comamne ageing
Like this we cna do lot of thwi here as a real linix host in disde container 
like install package create volume etc
if we referesh this page againg we weill show oru update nginx home pag

25:50
===============
Now we see how to chek logn of contierner 
like a we app application product some logs

the command is : docker log contienr id
check teh conteinr id then use it as:
we will see more abut this conter login about in contienr secotn in details 




26:35
=====================
Now we use a connand wht is show docker network
run it show defautl network, we not create any network but sow

what is actually docker entwork: in siede docker contienr to conterr ner communticat it use this network
we will see it more in docerk netwro seciton 
here is snotehr command of details sohow of contierner: docker instpct

28:10
========================
we can see docker volume usti this command 
then is not voluem ritht now because not voluem create we year


dockr loginlogu ut it nede to push imae in dockr hubn

dockr pur use delete all unuse image
dockr build conad for create iamge
we will se in details it in image and contienr seciton

and docker push for image urhnsin docker hub registtry

Next video we welll see docker inter architectue in details

Hello. Welcome to this Docker tutorial.
Hey everyone ! Welcome to this  tutorial on Docker

Hi there! Welcome to this Docker tutorial.
Hey there! Welcome to this tutorial on Docker.




So, grab your coffee, get comfortable, and let’s dive into the world of Docker!"

Alright, let’s dive in and get started!"





Welcome to the section on schedule management.
Whenever we talk about schedule management,
People get really excited.
Well, maybe excited it's not the right word, but they get very Interested. 
Because It's in this section that we are going to talk about database.






This is gonna be a long one.
#For Logger video

Gotta emphasize that.
#Need to Foucse on topic


It's not a small term, It's a broad term.
When you say stakeholder, you'r talking anyone that's affected by the actual project.
Now, thinking about this, I wanna mention that stakeholders could be positive or negatively effected.




You dont want thet.
Alright, so thet is a couple tips there, how to manage your time.

Hopefully, you guys enjoyed this video, if you do, Please give the video a like, subscribe to the channel.
We got much more content for you guys, and how to pass your exam on the first try.





You don't want that, Alright, so that is a couple tips there.


Lemme tell you guys something, this is too easy really easy.




If you're Like me and you're a moring person,
and you like taking exam early in the morning.


Let me explain.


Okey, so let's talk simulator.
So, this particular exam similator is somthing good.


Iam gonna be going over the diffeent type of question
You're gonna see on your PMP Exam.

 

So, a lot of people have this confusion that if that, "Oh i can't take the pmp exam because i dont have 36 month of being a project manager."
I dont have the title of being a project manager.
Okey, lemme just start off by saying you dont need the title.
of a project manager to be leading a project.

You dont have to be official project manager.
And the another question that people say to me: 
"Hey, I amd only work on my project , its a small project", that's fine too.




This is a great way to bakek in these concepts





To sow somthis additional same as
----------------------------------
So there are a couple of other things i want to show with pointers here.



Create some this and run it
-------------------------
As soon as you crate a Hashmap, this line of code up here will be automaticly generate.
So you dont  actually have to do this part.
And then this part down here is where we make map one have value.
And then we have map tow set equeal to map one
And then we'll just print out map one and map tow here.
So I'll run this.





Ok, so now Lets flip back
    Ager page jawa.

This is how it work when you not use the pointer.
    Kono keso na use korle kemon how 


















#aTopicAboutToStart:
=================================================



ToStartTopic
------------------
In this video, I'm gonna be talking about the
PMP Examination requiremdnts.

Now, always remember this.
In order to take your pmp certification, you are gonna have to show pmi three thisng.
You'er gonna have to document three thing on the application to submit it.

-Number One You'er gonna have to docuement your formal education.
This is gonna be like your highschool diploma, Bachelor or maybe Masters Degry.
So you gotta have some kind of formal education.

-Number two, depending on the formal education
You're gonna have to show a ceftain number of years worth  of experience and
that gonna be dependent on that form of education, 36 month or 60 Month.
Again, again , dependent on that form of education.

-And Number three, you gonna have to show 35 hours of Project management education.
Tha's what this course is.
This is the 35 hour worth of project management education.

Once again, quick review: formal education, exprienc, 35-hour class.
Just remember, those are teh three things.
You'ar gonna need to take, your gonna need to show actually in order to take your pmp exam.




Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:3
------------------------------------------------------
In this video, we are gonna be putting together the entire project schedule.
Now, if we go back to he very beginning. of this entire planning section.
We first collect our requirment, we developed our scope, we create oru wbs.
So now we know how logn each activity is taking.

Now we can take all of that information, build and entire schecule.
How it work, what we are doing with it, and so on and so on.
So that's what this section is.



Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:2
------------------------------------------------------
So what have we done so far in this section?
So far, we created thos activities, we defined them.
The last video, I sequenced them, i put them in an order and 
I build the project schedule network diagrame.

Now hat we are gonna do is we are going to say how long, how long does it take 
to do each one of these activities.
And the bring me to this process of estimate activity duration.

Thos os about estimation the number or work periods.
Now a work pereion is unique.





Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:
------------------------------------------------------
In this Video, I am gonna be talking about our next process or the next section
of our planning is gonna be schedule.
Now we just finish completing all of the processes the you would use to create your scope.
So in this part we're gonna look at what processes are we gonna use to create oru schedule.


StartNewVideo and Say about previous video was is
--------------------------------------------------
In this video, I amd gonna talk about the measurment performance domian.
Now, In the last one, I talked about the delivery performance domain.
In ones before that I talked about work and Planing.

You know what this domain is? It's about looking at the work you are doing.
It's about liiking at the work you are delivering and asking your self, am i doing it according to Plan ?
At the end of the day, one of the main jobs that you're gonna be doing as a project manager
is ensuring that the work stays on plan. It's about if it's going off plan.
to taking the appropriate steps and actions in order to bring it back on plan.
And to do that, we must measure the work. You must measure the time, measure the cost.




ToGaysNeedSamething:
------------------------------------------
Well, I need them to do help desk.
And youre like, Well I need them to do my project.
Boom, clash !


ForGoogleing:
----------------
So i'm gonna go to google.
And I'm going to type the PMP exam referernce list, just like that.
And we're gonna press enter on it.
And I am going to go to right here it says PMP, This the first linek should show up.
I'm gonna go right here and i wanna show your guys this.
So, this is the PMP exam reference list. 
Now what exactly is this ?
Well, this is gonna show me the content outline.
So this is a book that basically gives us all the individual things we need to konw for the exam.





I have an interesting story with this, with this mindset,   
and you'll here me tell this story back.
So I work at a school called technicl instirtie of america.
and the are a authorize traing patner.



But dont let the hard fquestion consume the time, because you know what's gonna happen ?
you spend too long on these hard question, and dthen you never get around to
answering the easy question that came at the end and you end up failing the test.








ToStartTopic
------------------
Hello and welcome back in this section we are going to take a look 
at a super commonly asked interview question the LinkList !

We are going to take a look at: What the are, how they work how they compare to array how to bu8ild our 
own and then go over some really key fundamental things for you to know during your interview.

So let's start by taking a liik at what a linked list is.


Very simply a linked list is nothing more then a serise of nodes linked together for me to list.
That's it !

Now the way linkList work is:- you always start with the very first element.
this one is a bit special. It's called the head.
That's the very first element of out list, that one does not have anything pointting to it
and we just call it hte head.

When you add subsequent nodes, all you do is you create a new node and then 
have the previous pointer point to it via its nest pointer here.

 That's why it's called a linkedList.
 That's the arrayList.


ToStartTopic
------------------
So now we're going to look linkedList.
This will be the first dataStrecture we build in the cousere.
And I'm going to start out explaining linked List by comparing them to and array list
and talk about the differences between an array list and a LinkList.




ToStartTopic
------------------
This section we'are going to take a look at what stack and queues are, 
how they work and what is there 



CompleteTopicAndSummeize
--------------------------
Alright ! There you have it. Big o notation.
This is a big step, you can do that now.
You have got the tools, you have got the basic language.
all you need now is practice and that's what we're going to do for the 
remainder of the course.

But at the end of the day you already know everything there is to 
know basically about how Big-O notation works.

Congratulation ! you know basic/advence now.
or
Congratulations you now underestand the binary serach tree.
Here's what you need to know for the interviews.
