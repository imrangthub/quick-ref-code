Welcome to the section on schedule management.
Whenever we talk about schedule management,
People get really excited.
Well, maybe excited it's not the right word, but they get very Interested. 
Because It's in this section that we are going to talk about database.






This is gonna be a long one.
#For Logger video

Gotta emphasize that.
#Need to Foucse on topic


It's not a small term, It's a broad term.
When you say stakeholder, you'r talking anyone that's affected by the actual project.
Now, thinking about this, I wanna mention that stakeholders could be positive or negatively effected.




You dont want thet.
Alright, so thet is a couple tips there, how to manage your time.

Hopefully, you guys enjoyed this video, if you do, Please give the video a like, subscribe to the channel.

You don't want that, Alright, so that is a couple tips there.


Lemme tell you guys something, this is too easy really easy.




If you're Like me and you're a moring person,
and you like taking exam early in the morning.


Let me explain.


Okey, so let's talk simulator.
So, this particular exam similator is somthing good.


Iam gonna be going over the diffeent type of question
You're gonna see on your PMP Exam.

 

So, a lot of people have this confusion that if that, "Oh i can't take the pmp exam because i dont have 36 month of being a project manager."
I dont have the title of being a project manager.
Okey, lemme just start off by saying you dont need the title.
of a project manager to be leading a project.

You dont have to be official project manager.
And the another question that people say to me: 
"Hey, I amd only work on my project , its a small project", that's fine too.




This is a great way to bakek in these concepts





To sow somthis additional same as
----------------------------------
So there are a couple of other things i want to show with pointers here.



Create some this and run it
-------------------------
As soon as you crate a Hashmap, this line of code up here will be automaticly generate.
So you dont  actually have to do this part.
And then this part down here is where we make map one have value.
And then we have map tow set equeal to map one
And then we'll just print out map one and map tow here.
So I'll run this.





Ok, so now Lets flip back
    Ager page jawa.

This is how it work when you not use the pointer.
    Kono keso na use korle kemon how

In this video, I'm gonna be talking about the
PMP Examination requiremdnts.

Now, always remember this.
In order to take your pmp certification, you are gonna have to show pmi three thisng.
You'er gonna have to document three thing on the application to submit it.

-Number One You'er gonna have to docuement your formal education.
This is gonna be like your highschool diploma, Bachelor or maybe Masters Degry.
So you gotta have some kind of formal education.

-Number two, depending on the formal education
You're gonna have to show a ceftain number of years worth  of experience and
that gonna be dependent on that form of education, 36 month or 60 Month.
Again, again , dependent on that form of education.

-And Number three, you gonna have to show 35 hours of Project management education.
Tha's what this course is.
This is the 35 hour worth of project management education.

Once again, quick review: formal education, exprienc, 35-hour class.
Just remember, those are teh three things.
You'ar gonna need to take, your gonna need to show actually in order to take your pmp exam.




Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:3
------------------------------------------------------
In this video, we are gonna be putting together the entire project schedule.
Now, if we go back to he very beginning. of this entire planning section.
We first collect our requirment, we developed our scope, we create oru wbs.
So now we know how logn each activity is taking.

Now we can take all of that information, build and entire schecule.
How it work, what we are doing with it, and so on and so on.
So that's what this section is.



Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:2
------------------------------------------------------
So what have we done so far in this section?
So far, we created thos activities, we defined them.
The last video, I sequenced them, i put them in an order and 
I build the project schedule network diagrame.

Now hat we are gonna do is we are going to say how long, how long does it take 
to do each one of these activities.
And the bring me to this process of estimate activity duration.

Thos os about estimation the number or work periods.
Now a work pereion is unique.





Talkoing baout:What is cover last video and start with what topic:
------------------------------------------------------
In this Video, I am gonna be talking about our next process or the next section
of our planning is gonna be schedule.
Now we just finish completing all of the processes the you would use to create your scope.
So in this part we're gonna look at what processes are we gonna use to create oru schedule.


StartNewVideo and Say about previous video was is
--------------------------------------------------
In this video, I amd gonna talk about the measurment performance domian.
Now, In the last one, I talked about the delivery performance domain.
In ones before that I talked about work and Planing.

You know what this domain is? It's about looking at the work you are doing.
It's about liiking at the work you are delivering and asking your self, am i doing it according to Plan ?
At the end of the day, one of the main jobs that you're gonna be doing as a project manager
is ensuring that the work stays on plan. It's about if it's going off plan.
to taking the appropriate steps and actions in order to bring it back on plan.
And to do that, we must measure the work. You must measure the time, measure the cost.




ToGaysNeedSamething:
------------------------------------------

I'm gonna go right here and i wanna show your guys this.
So, this is the PMP exam reference list. 
Now what exactly is this ?
Well, this is gonna show me the content outline.
So this is a book that basically gives us all the individual things we need to konw for the exam.





I have an interesting story with this, with this mindset,   
and you'll here me tell this story back.

But dont let the hard fquestion consume the time, because you know what's gonna happen ?
you spend too long on these hard question, and dthen you never get around to
answering the easy question that came at the end and you end up failing the test.

Hello and welcome back in this section we are going to take a look 
at a super commonly asked interview question the LinkList !

We are going to take a look at: What the are, how they work how they compare to array how to bu8ild our 
own and then go over some really key fundamental things for you to know during your interview.

So let's start by taking a liik at what a linked list is.


Very simply a linked list is nothing more then a serise of nodes linked together for me to list.
That's it !

Now the way linkList work is:- you always start with the very first element.
this one is a bit special. It's called the head.
That's the very first element of out list, that one does not have anything pointting to it
and we just call it hte head.

When you add subsequent nodes, all you do is you create a new node and then 
have the previous pointer point to it via its nest pointer here.

 That's why it's called a linkedList.
 That's the arrayList.


ToStartTopic
------------------
So now we're going to look linkedList.
This will be the first dataStrecture we build in the cousere.
And I'm going to start out explaining linked List by comparing them to and array list
and talk about the differences between an array list and a LinkList.




ToStartTopic
------------------
This section we'are going to take a look at what stack and queues are, 
how they work and what is there 



CompleteTopicAndSummeize
--------------------------
Alright ! There you have it. Big o notation.
This is a big step, you can do that now.
You have got the tools, you have got the basic language.
all you need now is practice and that's what we're going to do for the 
remainder of the course.

But at the end of the day you already know everything there is to 
know basically about how Big-O notation works.

Congratulation ! you know basic/advence now.
or
Congratulations you now underestand the binary serach tree.
Here's what you need to know for the interviews.
