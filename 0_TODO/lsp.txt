If you have decided to write this exam, the following points will help you:
a. Complete the KodeKloud CKAD course and do the hands-on exercises properly.
b. Use internet sources to solve as many questions as you can.
c. If you are CKA certified, focus only on the delta part.
d. After purchasing the exam, use killer.sh to practice questions and familiarize yourself with the exam environment. Take these questions seriously and try to solve them, or use the provided solutions to help you understand.
e. On the exam day, stay calm. The exam is not as difficult as people make it out to be, and the provided time is sufficient. Try to solve the questions you know first in the first 90 minutes, then use the remaining 30 minutes to tackle the more difficult questions. Do not get stuck on any question as it will consume your time.
f. Use a high-spec laptop, as using a lower-spec laptop like an i5 can cause performance issues during the exam.
g. The exam environment is known to be poor, with lags and hangs, but have patience. You will have sufficient time, so don't try to rush as the system may not work properly.
