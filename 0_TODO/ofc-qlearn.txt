@@@
=================================================
#Software Engineer interview
=================================================.

#Inv0
=================================================
1) UsesTechnology ? Can you tell me about your running project uses technology ?
    Currently I’m  working on a microservices-based solution using Java, Spring Framework. There are about 30 services.
    Here, we use Oracle and MySQL as our databases, OAuth2 for secure single sign-on (SSO), and Nginx as a reverse proxy.
    
    We utilize Jenkins for CI/CD and rely on Grafana with Loki for Monitoring and Alerting.
    Python is used to automate some of the daily basis tasks.
    We also have an Apache Kafka platform for distributing event processing.
    and Additionally common modern technologies such as Keepalive, Redis, Tomcat, Maven and Gradle, Angular, etc etc.


2) HighLevelArchitecture of for the SoftwareSystem.
    From the BottomLayer:
        We use MySQL and Oracle for data persistence, and consume a large number of service APIs from various Internal and 
        External services. 
        Actually, these services are the backbone of this entire system; we treat them as big-data and  data warehouse.
        Our Integration services are built on top of this layer, and then Business services consume the Integration Services 
        through REST APIs with Dynamic Service Discovery Mechanism.
        We Expose all the BusinessServices APIs through a central API Gateway, which simplifies access, and Finally Nginx as a proxy 
        between clients and services.

    We can broadly categorize our service-clients into two types:
        Internal clients like: MobileApp, Web different type of Corporate solutions, 
        External clients like: Third-parties/Sales-partners, here We ensure APIs-Security using OAuth2.
        

3) How do you maintain service HighAvailable, scalability , unexpected traffic surges and resiliency ?

    In a microservices architecture, we focus on several key strategies:
    to ensure this/resiliency:

    We use redundant VM, Services so there’s no single point of failure.
    For Failover mechanisms, we rely on load balancers with active-active strategies to ensure continuous service availability.

    To adjust the number of services based on traffic, we use both auto-scaling and manual scaling. 
    And protect backend services during traffic spikes, we enforce rate limiting.

    To minimize the impact of failures, we use the bulkhead pattern, which is isolates components. 
    And ensures that if one service encounters an issue, the other services continue to function properly.

    We also apply the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures and  temporarily api-resource switching.


4) How do you monitor and observe the system and Alerting system ?
    We implement health checks to monitor the status of each service using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
    Also use paython and bash script for critical component monitoring and traking If there’s any anomaly or performance degradation.
    We use sms alerting systems for offline notification and OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.


5) How do you handle receiving and delivering Change Requests (CRs) / How do you interect with Business Team?
    A ChangeRequest (CR) typically begins as: 
    The business team / stakeholder shares it via email with the necessary documentation.
    Schedule meeting for requirement clarification and we make sure our understanding is clear.
    Then, we analyze the impact, estimate the effort, and share a plan.
    Once approved, we implement the changes, test it and deploy them to the test environment.
    After that we conduct a UAT session, and if everything meets as expectations, we proceed with the release and 
    Finally deploy it to production.


6) What is the best thing you have done in your career journey? 
Here I can share a couple of my experiences. They may not be significant, but they are interesting.
    In a system, the tasksIssues we handle on a regular basis can be broadlyi classified into two categories: 
    common tasksIssues and Exceptional ones.
        Common tasksIssues usually have Straightforward solutions or just require a quick Google search.
        Exceptional issues are unique, don’t come with ready-made solutions, and presenting new challenges each time.
Here, I’ll share an ExceptionalIssue related to a MicroserviceGateway.

I) Gateway Issue
II) Stateless OTP
III) Exclent coden



7) Interviewer: How do you manage stakeholders effectively in your projects?
Candidate: 
    Stakeholder management is all about communication and collaboration. 
    I start by:
                Identifying the Key-Stakeholders, 
                Understanding their Roles, and Prioritizing based on Roles.

    I keep communication clear by sharing regular updates through meetings, emails, or tools like JIRA.
    I set realistic expectations from the start and provide timely updates if there are any changes or issues.

Interviewer: How do you handle conflicts or disagreements with stakeholders?
Candidate: 
    I address conflicts by listening to their concerns and finding common ground, 
    Actually we need to dealIt / explainIt such a way that:
    We are doesn't work for each other we have a goal and it's a common Goal, what is our business-objective and the company's success !
    There’s nothing personal here. 
    To achieve our common goal, we must collaborate, support one another,
    do pull and push if needed and ensure everyone stays on the same page and same target.

5) This project doesn’t align with my interests. Do you have any other opportunities where I could get involved?
   Actually, Interest is prohibited in Islam.





=================================================
##askToexplain-Specific-details
=================================================
Before we begin main part of the interview, if you allow me a few minutes, 
I'd like to provide a detailed overview of my career journey, 
This will give you a clear understanding of my experience and technological knowledge depth.

In the skill chart I provided, there is no false information.
However, the matrix and proficiency level values were not entirely accurate due to a misunderstanding on my part.

I hope this way I can clarify my position to you.
Yes, you can interrupt at any time to ask specific questions or request me to skip certain parts.


Is this okay?
Does this sound good to you?



FirstTwoYearsExp:
-----------------
In the first two years of my career, I worked on two monolithic applications.
During this time, I gained foundational knowledge of the Java Spring framework, Hibernate, and MySQL.

Most of my assigned tasks were UI/UX related, so
My knowledge of Java and other technologies from that time remains at a basic level.

The frontend implementation was  using raw JavaScript and jQuery. 
I have invested a lot of time and effort into it, gaining a deeper understanding of it.
I would rate myself 8 out of 10 in JavaScript and jQuery because I understand What is JavaScript and how it works, 
I know it works with BOM (Browser Object Model) and DOM (Document Object Model).
It's a powerful object-based scripting language.
It can recognization a single resolution change on the web page and be able to take action base on it.

and The, jQuery is simply a JavaScript library that provides efficient way to write cleaner and more readable JavaScript code.

For example, in JavaScript, we use:
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    // Action to be performed on click
});
With jQuery, the same functionality is simplified:
$("#myButton").click(function() {
    // Action to be performed on click
});

Although I haven't worked  with JavaScript in recent years, it is not an issue for me.
Yes, newer versions have been released with updates, innovations, and improvements, but that doesn’t matter to me.
I can quickly figure-it-out by referring to the documentation or doing some research on Google.





Subsequently, I found more interesting projects at MysoftLimited, It was ModularBased Huge-MedicalERP System.
Around 26 Module.
The project was a 10-year-old JavaFX desktop-based ERP solution in the medical domain, backed by an Oracle database.
It was an excellent and stable system, supported by a brilliant DBA team.

In 2018, the company started losing clients because they were demanding web-based solutions.
As a result, management decided to migrate the desktop solution to a web-based platform and onboard a Java team.
I joined this team.

The web-based solution architecture was :
    Frontend: Angular
    Middleware: A modular, Maven-based Java Spring Boot solution
    Database: Oracle, We kept the existing Oracle database as it was, because it was stable and relatively complex, 
    containing thousands of objects such as tables, views, procedures, functions, indexes, etc.

    That focus and the middlebar and frontend for web-base solution.
    All services directly interacted with the database using JPA, exposed REST APIs, and ensured security using 
    OAuth2 with a Spring Authorization Server.
    For reporting, the system used JasperReports.

I served as a full-stack-developer and took responsibility for developing several critical module such as:
    Prescription, Pathology, OT, CRM and paritle Other.
My core responsibilities was exploring customer requirements, analyzing data-base, figure-out the business logic, 
and implement it.
    Typically, as a full-stack developer we worked on every aspect of feature development, 
From database design, rapid backend development, handling complex UX, generating reports To production-deployment.


Here, I fell in love with Angular.
I developed a patient appointment form, an IPD patient data entry form, and over 200+ pathology result entry forms.

If you've seen clinical pathology reports like CBC or X-ray reports, you know how complex their data structures can be.
With the power of Angular, I was able to build these complex forms in a fast and efficient way, ensuring a smooth user experience.

and JasperReport for print this report.
I believe very few people have this level of experience in handling such complex UI/UX.

I would rate myself 8 out of 10 in Angular and SQL-DML.
Intermediate in Java and Spring Boot.





 
-- end --
Finally in Brainstation, I joined this company 3 years ago from now.






You will agree with me that


Spring vs. Spring Boot
A comprehensive framework for Java EE development. 
It provides a lot of powerful features like dependency injection (DI), AOP, and transaction management, 
but it requires manual configuration for things like setting up a web server, database connections, and security.

Spring Boot, on the other hand,  a specialized extension of Spring that simplifies Spring application development.
It comes with auto-configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat), and a lot of defaults configuration 
what is let you start coding right away without worrying about a lot of setup.
Eliminates boilerplate code and XML configuration, enabling faster development.

Key Differences:
If you're building a microservice or a REST API, applications needing rapid development and deployment then 
Spring Boot is usually the better choice because it reduces  boilerplate code and speeds up development.

For large enterprise applications that need fine-tuned configurations, you might still prefer plain Spring.




MyEducation++More:
----------------------------------------------
I passed SSC in 2007, then pursued a Diploma in Computer Technology, which I completed in 2013, 
where I first discovered my passion for technology. 

Following my diploma, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Daffodil International University in 2016. 
During this program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of core concepts in Software Engineering, preparing me as a programmer.

I started my career in the tech industry after earning my Bachelor's degree and gained valuable hands-on experience, 
which not only provided me with practical insights but also helped me financially support myself.

Afterward, I decided to pursue a Master's degree and fund it through my own income. 
I completed my Master's degree in 2019 while simultaneously working full-time.

Overall, my education has not only provided me with theoretical insights but also practical experience through hands-on projects 
and industry-relevant coursework.


=================================================
##Inv1
=================================================

Interviewer: Can you walk us through your process for debugging a complex issue in your code?

    Interviewee: Sure, I usually start by looking at the error message and trying to understand what went wrong. 
    Which layer raises this problem, is it from front-end backend persistence layers or any other cases?
    From there, I'll review the code and try to reproduce the issue. 
    If I can't reproduce it, I'll start adding logging statements to track down the problem. 
    Once I have a better understanding of the issue, I'll start testing potential solutions and iterating until 
    I find the root cause and fix it.


Interviewer: Can you tell us about a particularly challenging project you've worked on and how you approached it?

    Interviewee: Sure, I worked on a  Microservice Solution with 40+ services, Its a learge scalable backend system 
    for a Leading Telco Company here we had to deal with a huge number of traffic, concurrency deployment with Zero dwontime. 
    It was a lot of work, but we were able to successfully launch the Solution and scale it up as needed.
    Technology uses: Java, Spring-cloud.

    We also had to ensure that the microservice was resilient to failures and could recover quickly in case of any issues. 
    This involved implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system that could detect issues and notify us immediately.
    Like: Memory uses, CPU uses, ErrorRate, RttSucessRate etc.

    We also had to perform regular load testing and capacity planning to make sure that the microservice 
    could handle the expected load and scale as needed.



Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging project. How did you handle communication with the stakeholders 
and the team members?

    Interviewee: Communication was critical for the success of the project. 
    We held regular meetings with the stakeholders to get feedback and clarify requirements. 
    We also had to work closely with the product team to make sure that the developing solution met their needs.

    For the technical discussions, we held regular team meetings to review progress and discuss any technical 
    challenges. We used various collaboration tools such as Slack and Jira to track progress and assign tasks. 
    We also made sure that we had clear documentation and shared our progress with the stakeholders regularly.




Interviewer: Impressive. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in software engineering?

    Interviewee: I'm a big believer in continuous learning, so I make a point to attend industry conferences and 
    read industry publications. 
    I also enjoy participating in online communities and attending meetups to stay connected 
    with other developers and learn from their experiences.
    I followed the thech github repository.



Interviewer: Can you tell us about a time when you had to collaborate with a team to complete a project
and how you handled it?

    Interviewee: Absolutely. My recent project, I was part of a team tasked with building a new feature for a 
    healthcare app. 
    We had to work closely with the product team to understand their requirements, and with the 
    QA team to ensure that the feature was tested thoroughly. 
    We also had to work within tight deadlines and make sure that all team members were on the same page. 
    To handle this, I made sure that we had regular team meetings and used project management tools to 
    track progress and assign tasks. 
    Communication was key in making sure that everyone was aware of what was happening and what needed to be done.

#Induction Meeting for online Instructor
-------------------------------------------------
I am a professional, working in the corporate environment for the last 6 years.
You do your business, I play my role. 
If everything passes well, If we are able to deliver our service properly then we both will be benefited.
To achieve that it is my responsibility to follow the company rules and policies. 
So it will be no issue.


By-the-way: 
        I need to know the course delivery process/LifeCycle, how a course is planned and how it is delivered. 
And also
When you assign me to a course or class, please let me know as soon as possible.
Or We can take a short discussions before starting the course.
Because I have to manage my time for ensure my availability and have to be mentally prepared for it.



In my experience I find that, every training center has different approach to delivery their course.
They offer different subject with variety of delivery methods for a single subject. 
For example CoursesOfJava, they offer long courses, short courses sometimes workshops asPer needs of the students.
Same topic with different time duration. 

So here What is the plan for it?
Do you have a course curriculum or how do you manage students during the course?

I have a course syllabus for my subject, that mentions which topics will be covered in which course and its duration. 
Like: CoreJava courses are about 60 hours-long, and it's covered this this topics.
It's a general syllabus and it's customizable.
Usually, it is shared with the students at the beginning of the course.
For Given an idea to students of how many hours we will spend on which topic and when-until we will complete this course.

So here What is the plan for it?
I don't know whether it shared to the students from your site or whether I have to do that.
And if it DoneBy from your site, please align me with that information like: course syllabus. 
Because we have to be on the same page front of the students.
