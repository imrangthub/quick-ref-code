##7) Networking and Security
=================================================



Why actually this docker network for, why need this....

because now real world project architects gating complex day by day, 
especially multi-tier applications and microservice architects


where different services need to interact. 
    For example, an app server needs to communicate with a database server or other services.



Thing about now a multi-tier applications:
In real-world applications, where different components of the application 
(like the frontend, backend, and database) run in different environments, 

Docker ensures they can securely talk to each other.



Also Security Considerations: 
Networking in Docker also plays a major role in security. 

For example, you might want the database to only be accessible by the app server and 
not by the public network. 







Let’s consider a three-tier application:

The frontend app is deployed in a public network.
The app server is deployed in a secure network.
The database server is placed in another secure network with restricted access, 
allowing only the app server to communicate with it.



Docker  network installation work just like same as a general host.
it user a virtual eitner nete.




Every container run with in a netwrok and has it a IP addr.

Till now we are not use dockr network but we run continer right ?



so how it work ..?

Default Network: 
Docker provides a default network called the bridge network. 
When you run a container and don't specify a network, it will automatically connect to this bridge network.




You can view Docker’s networks using the:
docker network ls command. 
This shows all available networks, including the default ones.



To get more details on how a container is connected to a network, 
use the docker inspect command. 


This command will show you detailed information, including the network settings and which 
network a container is using.









9:30:
=================
Now we’ll be creating our first Docker network. 

Lets Creating a Network: 
To create a Docker network, you simply use the docker network create command. 


By default, if you don’t specify a network driver, 
Docker will create the network using the bridge driver.




What is a Network Driver? 
It determines how containers can communicate with each other and the host machine. 


Lets explore our created netowrk.
Its come with a dirrernet subnet.



Inspecting the Network: After creating the network, we can inspect it using the docker network 
inspect <network_name> command. 
This will show the details of the network, such as the subnet, gateway, and the containers connected to it.



Custom Subnet: 
    When you create a network, Docker automatically assigns a subnet for it. 
    However, you can specify a custom subnet if needed. 
    This allows you to define a specific range of IPs that your containers can use, 
    providing better control over your network configuration.


Containers connected to the bridge network are assigned a unique IP address from the network's subnet. 
This ensures that each container can be individually addressed within the network.





Host Driver: 
The host driver connects the container directly to the host machine’s network. 
This means the container will share the same network namespace as the host machine, 
and you can access it using the host's IP address. 
The container won’t have its own IP; it uses the host machine’s IP.




None Driver: 
The none driver essentially isolates the container from any network. 
Containers using this driver have no network connection at all and can’t communicate with 
other containers or the host machine.

===================

Lets see our current container ip and thre network !

Lets go inside thei contienr using exec.

Your see its it IP !



Lets check another one !
the same way go inside the contienr 
and chedck it ip.




As the use same subnet then should maek coumunitcation.
Lets check it.
letc url a curl commane.





Lets create curstome new network.


Lets check it usign inspect command.
Your see it come with new subnet serise.








Now lets try communtixton of using this new netowrk.

To do that i am gnna run tow serveice usign this service.


Lets say we have and db server and a application service.

Lets run a app serfive using same netowrk.


Lets run anoter contienr call my-backend.
Its run done.


so we have now two continer one db server and one for applicaiton server.

your see when i run db servei i it run with my cursome network.

but my application run with defautl network as 
we are not mentation any netwokr when we run it.


Now tow contaienr run with dirretrne netowrk.
Lets check are they able to make connrdction or not?


lets do a curl request 
I have to ip adress.
Right now i amd insise in db so i can maek curl.

now lets try thsi from app server to connect to
db servrr.


I amd inside db server:
Lets echek it Ip first.

Now lets try a curl to my application to make cunnection.

we should not get any response because the on tow different network.
and you no response.



Lets fixed it, 
Lets run our backend service with the same network
with database server what is uses.


you can inspect dataisl of the my_net using inspect
It will shwo how amy contienr connecti with it.




Lts run our second contianr.


Lets checkf netwrk ageint.
You see its show now boutu contner ip.



Now letc check tow service communitcation !
Now then should able to make connection.


lets go inside contienr 
lets run a curl.


now you see we get ther response from our db contienr.



This is how brize network work.

when multiple contaienr run on same net then can communticaotn.







29:00
============================



Host Network: 
How it work ? it make direct conenction with host machine.
Your can be access using host ip.

Host network not use so much,Your can find its details in docker doc.



lets talk about Overlay Network: 

The overlay network is used for clustering multiple Docker nodes, 
such as in a Docker Swarm. 

The overlay network enables communication between containers on different Docker nodes within the cluster. 
It ensures that containers across multiple machines can communicate as if they were on the same network.







Lets talk about now user difent netork.
Lets crate a Custom Subnet our cont9enr netowrk.


In previous steps, we used Docker's default subnet. 
Now, let's create a network with a custom subnet. 
This allows us to define our own range of IP addresses and gateway for the network.



Lets check current network we have.
lets check one 
We dont mentation any subnet on thsi network.


now let crate one with custome subnet.


on the commen:
I menation the sunbet and a gatewowrk ip form thsi subnet.
LETS set a name for it.



lets ehck 
lets see detaisl using inspect


we can inspect it to view the network details, such as the assigned subnet, IP range, and gateway.


Now if run a conteir usign this netork 
the contienr will get a ip from this subnet.



Lets run one .

When we run a container on the custom subnet, it will be assigned an IP address from the defined subnet.
we give it name mynet2 I gooona mame the contienr mydb3.




Let’s run the container and check its IP using the docker inspect command. 
The container should receive an IP address from our custom subnet, 
and we’ll confirm it by inspecting the container’s network settings.





That wraps up this tutorial on Docker networks. 
We’ve learned about bridge, host, and overlay networks, how to create custom networks with subnets, 
and how containers can communicate with each other.
