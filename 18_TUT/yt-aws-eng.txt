Cost And Budgets: Some basic about how to set/ manage cost and budget to set for your accout.


User, Role and IAM User: here we talk about diffetn type of aws user role and IAM user.

AWS Architecture, Regions and AZ: Here we talk AWS architecutre oveerview with region and az. 

Play with EC2:    this is will be detail video with aws most uses serice ec2.


AWS Storage services: In thsi section we talk about aws starage serices.

Database in AWS : in this section we takling about aws availabel database serices.

ELB, ASG: here we talk about elb anbd asg.


AWS Managed Services: in this section we explore aws manage serice.


AWS Serverless:  herw we talk about aws serverless serivces.


AWS Queue and Streams: in thsi secton we explore aws quesu and stream strvices.


Route53 and CDN: In this seton we see Route53 and cdn.

AWS Networking: we explore aws infrrstractr and networking here.

Security and Monitoring: we talk about aws securty system here.

==================

Cloud computing: Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources 
access via the internet, like applications, servers, storage, databases, software, etc.

the give you on demand serice and hareware for you business or personal uses as like as you need.

when upi uses t this get bill if not uses then not get ablu bill

================
Service Models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform that includes infrastructure.
Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet.

In current worl there is many of cloud provider, and awe is one of them.



Here are key characteristics of Cloud service and what a cloud providewr like aws provede:

On-Demand Self-Service: 
Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

Broad Network Access: 
Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere.

Rapid Elasticity: 
Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to accommodate changes in demand. 

Measured Service: 
Cloud resources are metered, and users are billed based on their usage.

You can explore of aws cost, how much you have to for a perticualt service.
You can make asisment and get ide you many system generate cost with given 
how many whitch serice need and run from which Regions and how many time.
after give this all information you cand generate a simple bill adn see how may 
may you get cost about you system.

===============
AWS provides over 200 different services across various categories, including computing, storage, 
databases, machine learning, analytics, security, networking, Internet of Things (IoT), developer tools, 
and more.


Basic serices:
1. Compute Services:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud, allowing users to run applications and workloads.

2. Networking:
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Allows users to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.
Route53: Scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) web service.

3. Storage and Content Delivery:
S3 (Simple Storage Service): Offers scalable object storage with high durability.
EBS (Elastic Block Store): Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
Glacier: Offers low-cost, long-term archival storage.
CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) service for securely delivering data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally.

4. Databases:
RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service supporting multiple database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database service that scales automatically.
