Cloud Computing Explained:
Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources via the internet, including applications, servers, storage, databases, and software.

It offers flexible services and hardware for businesses and personal useâ€”just as much as you need.

ðŸ’¡ Pay-as-you-go Model: You only pay for what you use.
If youâ€™re not using resources, you wonâ€™t be billed!

Simple, scalable, and cost-efficient! ðŸš€

Cloud Service Models & Key Characteristics Explained

Letâ€™s talk about Cloud Service Models:

âœ… IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) â€“ Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking.

âœ… PaaS (Platform as a Service) â€“ Offers a complete platform that includes infrastructure and tools to develop applications.

âœ… SaaS (Software as a Service) â€“ Delivers software applications over the internet, no installation required!

AWS as a Cloud Provider
AWS is one of the top cloud providers out there, offering a wide range of services.

Now, letâ€™s explore Key Characteristics of Cloud Services:

ðŸ”¹ On-Demand Self-Service â€“ You can provision and manage resources as needed, without any intervention from the service provider.

ðŸ”¹ Broad Network Access â€“ Cloud services are accessible from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.

ðŸ”¹ Rapid Elasticity â€“ Scale your resources up or down quickly based on your needs, perfect for handling traffic spikes.

ðŸ”¹ Measured Service â€“ Resources are metered, so youâ€™re billed based on actual usage.

AWS Cost Explorer
With AWS, you can easily check your costs:

Assess costs for specific services based on your usage.
Choose regions and services, and see how they impact the cost.
Generate a simple bill to get an idea of how much youâ€™ll pay for your system.
With this, you can predict costs and manage your cloud budget effectively. ðŸš€

===============
AWS offers over 200 different services across various categories like computing, storage, databases, machine learning, security, networking, and more!

Basic AWS Services
âœ… Compute Services:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) â€“ Scalable virtual servers in the cloud for running applications and workloads.
âœ… Networking:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) â€“ Create isolated sections of the AWS Cloud for secure networking.
Route 53 â€“ Scalable and highly available DNS web service.
âœ… Storage & Content Delivery:

S3 (Simple Storage Service) â€“ Scalable and highly durable object storage.
EBS (Elastic Block Store) â€“ Block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.
Glacier â€“ Low-cost, long-term archival storage.
CloudFront â€“ CDN service for securely delivering data, videos, apps, and APIs globally.
âœ… Databases:

RDS (Relational Database Service) â€“ Managed relational databases supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
DynamoDB â€“ Fully managed NoSQL database with automatic scaling.
These services are the building blocks for deploying powerful applications on AWS. ðŸš€





28:00
======================
Before we dive into exploring AWS services, the first step is to create an AWS account.

In the next video, we'll walk you through the process of opening an account, what you need to get started, 
and how to take advantage of AWSâ€™s free tier.

Stay tuned, and let's get started! ðŸš€








=================================================
Opening AWS Account and Free Tier
=================================================
In this tutorual we will see aws account opening, and for this:

To open an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account, you'll need the following:

Email Address: You must have a valid email address to create an AWS account.

Valid Card: AWS requires a valid credit card to verify your identity and to set up billing. 

Phone Number: AWS may also require a valid phone number for additional account verification purposes also for two-factor authentication.

Billing Address: You'll need to provide a billing address associated with your credit card for invoicing purposes.

Agree to AWS Terms and Conditions: You'll need to review and agree to AWS's terms of service, which outline the terms and conditions of using their services.





2:20
=============
Lets start accout opening to this this link 
SignUp Link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin

or

do search aws and go Create a Accoutn link.

I already have and aws accoutn, so i not gonna open accoutn ageing, but show the 
from and screenshot for open accoutn step by stpe.


In first from:
    you have to privide accoutn email, and a root user name 
    then you get email verification from, a code sent to your email and ypu have to put it here.
    and press verify button.


In second from:
 you have to provide your contact information here like:Country city, postal code, phone number etc.

then anohter form asky you for Billing information :
    you have to add you credit/debit cred number here as payment information 


and now final step:
    you almost done, you have to choose a support plan, in this case for learning perpos you can select
    "Basic support" what is free.



4:20
================================
Now we ging explore how aws free tier work and what is the policy.


Its a serice for 1 yesr, you can explore some pre-defined  aws services.
Different service have the different policy for this free tier priod.

This detisl you get from in aws site:
usihg this liknk, or to google and search for it.

You need to keep a watchful eye on it, or you may encounter an unexpected bill.


Like for EC2 as VM you can use 720 hour per-month in this 1 year free tier period.


So better utiliztion and bring best benifets you must stop the service after you practice.
If you dont stop the serice, hwo ever sign out your accout or close browser, what ever you do 
the service in running on awe data-server and You may exceed the free tier hours and start getting charged on your account, so be careful.


Some of service all version/family not allow in free tier, like ec2.
only a perticular family instance ec2 with specific hared ware like cpu and memory are available for free tier.


You can get every clear data from aws docueemntation for thsi all inform about serives.


next video will start using aws service on handon.






=================================================
Getting Started
=================================================

Lets start with our aws first serivcices explore.\
For thst we have to fiest logn in to it. by console.


For working with aws we can use:
    AWS Management Console with password
    Command Line Interface (CLI) with protected by access keys
    Software Developer Kit (SDK)  with protected by access keys



what you after login in aws, its thei management console.
For learning perpose i recommen you to use management colsole, this is the best for now.

When you get expertices, for faster you will use cli.
adn sdk for with out human interaction, like a agent or software you thsi sdk.

Sdk come with for almost all common programming lenguage.



4:20
====================
Lets run our first serive, to do that.
go to management console serches for it. like ec2, rds,s3 etc.



5:00
=========================
Lets lucn a ec2 !

To luch the instance we have to give a naem first:
select a os for this instance. like Ubuntu.

then a isntance type, there is differetn type of instance but for free tier perion we ging to select t2-micro 
what is good engouth fro learning perpose,

Then a key pair, with is need for remote loging with cli, we will see in details in future video.


In Neworking section, we have to select a security group what is like a firewal.
we see more details about it, a dedicated vidow we have for Neworking sand security. so dont worry for now.


the storage:
select some space for vaolume, we leva it at that.

and finally click Lunch button..
The instance now starting its take few time to boot up...


Okey then, Instance is running now !
For more details about we can see it from here.


Here we can get this instance info like:
private ip, public ip, publick dns etc.



10:30
=================================
Now our instance is ready, to make it use ful just like a server we have to install some package on it.

to do that we have to login into it.

One way is click this icon here  and it wiil automaticly open with cli mode on it.


I am click it and now i am insert into it.
lets run a cat command to check the release version.


to install any package, i ad do first run apt get update, just like a physical linux machine.
Its done, lets install a server, it can be nginx.
you know that what to do ! its just like a regular linux machine.

nginx run done, lest check it. its port running port.

oh ! net-tools is missing, we need to install net-tools package on it.
lets do it.
done.

check the runnign port on this host..
oke, we found nginx ! its run on 80 port as usual.

Lets access the server !

For that we gonna use public dns or public ip of this ec2 instans.
Its in instance details section. lets get it and access the seriver.

yes we get it ! nginx form aws !




15:00
==================

Now we going to do copy some file from my local machine to aws instance !
to do that we going to use cli.

In this case my cases ths is Wondows a powersheel i am going to using.


Or 
you can yous a aws pythonb sdk.

You can get this python sdk from github, here is teh git link on my document i aready added it.



and You also go with Software Sdk.

Here is a node sdk exmple.
