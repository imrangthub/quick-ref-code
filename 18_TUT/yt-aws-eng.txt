================================
"Hey everyone! In this video, we’ll explore how AWS Free Tier works and what policies you need to be aware of.
Let’s dive in!"



[WHAT IS AWS FREE TIER?]
✅ AWS Free Tier gives you 1 year of free access to select AWS services.
✅ Each service has different limits and policies.
✅ You can find full details on the AWS website or by searching on Google.

[IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW]
✅ Watch your usage carefully to avoid unexpected charges.
✅ Example: EC2 (Virtual Machine) allows 720 hours per month under Free Tier.
✅ If you don’t stop the service, even after signing out or closing your browser, it keeps running on AWS servers, and you might exceed your Free Tier limit.

[LIMITATIONS]
✅ Not all AWS services are included in Free Tier.
✅ Some services, like EC2, only offer specific instance types (CPU, memory).
✅ Always check AWS documentation for clear details.

"That’s how AWS Free Tier works!
In the next video, we’ll start using AWS services hands-on.







=================================================

=================================================
Cost And Budgets
=================================================
In this tutorial, we will talk about Cost and Budgets in AWS.

AWS provides a dashboard called Cost Management, where you can see all AWS-related costs in one place.

Let's check it out. Open the Cost Management dashboard.

Here, you can see the individual costs for each service, how much is being consumed, and other details.

You can also estimate future costs using the AWS My Estimation menu.

For example, if you need a database server or any other service, you can calculate how much the bill will be based on usage and time.

This helps in planning your AWS budget effectively.






2:20
==============
Let's calculate the bill for an EC2 service.

1️⃣ Select EC2 from the services list.
2️⃣ Choose a region—AWS pricing varies by region for the same server.

We will discuss regions and transactions in more detail later.

Now, select the instance family based on your server requirements.

Payment Options
AWS offers different payment options, each with different cost-saving benefits.

Additional Costs
You can add extra storage volumes, monitoring tools, etc., which increase the service cost.

AWS Budget Notifications
AWS provides a notification system for budget tracking.

You can set a cost threshold.
If the cost exceeds the threshold, AWS sends alerts via SMS, email, etc.
You can take actions like stopping a service or starting another based on notifications.
Creating a Budget
You can create a budget for a single service or multiple services.
AWS Budget helps you track and control your personal or company expenses.

You can also save budgets and create templates for frequent use.

For learning purposes, we can set a $0 or $1 budget to minimize costs and prevent accidental charges.











=================================================
User, Role and IAM User
=================================================
In this tutorial, we will discuss AWS Users, IAM Roles, and IAM Users—their differences, best practices, and how they help manage access in AWS.

1️⃣ AWS Root User
The Root User is created when you sign up for an AWS account.
It has full control over all AWS services and resources.
Best Practice: Avoid using the root user for daily tasks. Instead, create IAM users with specific permissions.
2️⃣ AWS IAM Users (Identity and Access Management)
IAM users have unique credentials (username/password or access keys).
They can have custom permissions to access only the necessary AWS resources.
Common Use Cases:
Developers accessing specific AWS services.
Admin users managing AWS accounts.
Applications using access keys for authentication.
Security Best Practices:
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Assign least privilege permissions—only what is required.
Rotate access keys regularly to prevent security risks.
3️⃣ AWS IAM Roles
IAM roles allow AWS services or users to assume temporary access permissions.
Unlike IAM users, roles do not require long-term credentials.
Common Use Cases:
EC2 instances accessing S3 without storing credentials.
Lambda functions interacting with databases.
Federated access for users logging in via external identity providers.
4️⃣ AWS Federated Users
These are users who log in using an external identity provider (e.g., Active Directory, Google, Facebook).
They do not need IAM user accounts but gain access through IAM roles.
Useful for large enterprises with existing authentication systems.
5️⃣ AWS Account
An AWS account represents a unique business or organization within AWS.
It includes:
Billing and resource management.
Security and identity settings.
Multiple IAM users and roles under one account.
🔹 Key Takeaways
✔️ Use the root user only for critical tasks, like billing or security configurations.
✔️ Create IAM users for team members and assign permissions carefully.
✔️ Use IAM roles to grant temporary access instead of long-term credentials.
✔️ Enable MFA and follow security best practices to protect your AWS environment.

Managing users, roles, and permissions properly helps secure your AWS infrastructure while ensuring smooth operations.







3:30
====================

We will also learn how to assign permissions and sign in as an IAM user step by step.

1️⃣ What is an IAM User?
An IAM (Identity and Access Management) user is a secure way to allow individuals or applications to access AWS services without using the root account.

✅ Each IAM user has specific credentials (username/password or access keys).
✅ Users can have custom permissions to access only the required AWS services.
✅ Using IAM users ensures better security and access control.

📌 Example:

A developer may have access to EC2 but not billing.
A finance team may have access to AWS billing but not EC2 instances.
2️⃣ IAM Policies – Controlling Access
IAM policies define what an IAM user, group, or role is allowed or denied to do in AWS.
A policy consists of statements that specify:
✔️ Allowed or denied actions (e.g., Start EC2, Read S3 bucket).
✔️ Resources on which these actions apply (e.g., specific S3 buckets).
✔️ Conditions for access (e.g., allowed only from a certain IP address).

Types of IAM Policies
🔹 AWS Managed Policies – Predefined by AWS for common use cases.
🔹 Customer Managed Policies – Custom policies created by users.
🔹 Inline Policies – Directly attached to a single IAM user, group, or role.

📌 Example Policy (Allow access to S3):

3️⃣ IAM Groups – Simplifying User Management
IAM Groups allow you to assign policies to multiple users at once, instead of assigning permissions individually.

✔️ Helps organize users based on their roles.
✔️ Users in a group inherit all the group permissions.
✔️ Makes permission management easier when onboarding new users.

📌 Example Groups:

Developers Group – Can access EC2, RDS, S3.
Admins Group – Full access to AWS resources.
Read-Only Group – Can only view AWS services but cannot modify them.
4️⃣ Step-by-Step: Creating an IAM Policy and Group
Now, let’s create an IAM policy and a user group and assign them to an IAM user.
📺 Watch the step-by-step process on the screen!

🔹 Step 1: Go to the IAM Management Console.
🔹 Step 2: Create a new policy with required permissions.
🔹 Step 3: Create an IAM group and attach the policy.
🔹 Step 4: Add an IAM user to the group.
🔹 Step 5: Assign necessary credentials.

5️⃣ Signing in as an IAM User
Once permissions and groups are assigned, we will sign in as the IAM user and verify access.

📌 IAM User Login Steps:
1️⃣ Open the AWS IAM Sign-In page.
2️⃣ Enter the IAM user credentials (username & password).
3️⃣ Verify that access is restricted based on permissions.

✅ IAM users help maintain secure and controlled access to AWS resources.
✅ Policies and groups simplify management, making it easy to assign permissions to multiple users.

🔹 Final Thoughts
✔️ Use IAM Users instead of the root user for daily tasks.
✔️ Apply least privilege when assigning permissions.
✔️ Use IAM Groups to manage multiple users efficiently.
✔️ Regularly review IAM Policies to maintain security.

That’s how AWS IAM Users, Policies, and Groups work!
🚀 Stay secure and manage access the right way!







=================================================
AWS Architecture, Regions and AZ
=================================================

In this tutorial, we will talk about AWS Architecture, Regions, and Availability Zones (AZs).
Understanding these concepts is essential for building scalable, reliable, and high-performance applications in the cloud.

1️⃣ AWS Architecture – Key Concepts
AWS is designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability through:

✔️ Regions – Independent geographical locations.
✔️ Availability Zones (AZs) – Data centers within a region.

📌 AWS Documentation:
Regions & Availability Zones

2️⃣ What is an AWS Region?
A Region is a geographically isolated area where AWS resources are hosted.

✅ Each region is independent to ensure reliability.
✅ Helps businesses deploy applications close to their customers for better performance.
✅ Regions are separated to prevent failures from affecting global AWS services.

📌 Example AWS Regions:

us-east-1 (Virginia, USA)
eu-west-1 (Ireland)
ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
🔹 Choosing the right region depends on latency, compliance, and cost.

3️⃣ What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?
An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center or a collection of data centers within a region.

✅ Each region has multiple AZs to ensure redundancy.
✅ AZs are connected via low-latency networks.
✅ If one AZ fails, AWS automatically shifts workloads to another AZ.

📌 Example:
A region like us-east-1 has multiple AZs:

us-east-1a
us-east-1b
us-east-1c
🔹 Best Practice: Always deploy applications across multiple AZs for high availability.

4️⃣ Why Are AWS Regions and AZs Important?
AWS Regions and Availability Zones are critical for:

✔️ Fault Tolerance – Prevents system failures by distributing workloads.
✔️ Scalability – Allows businesses to expand without downtime.
✔️ Disaster Recovery – Ensures data is safe even if one AZ goes down.
✔️ High Performance – Reduces latency by serving users from the nearest region.

5️⃣ Best Practices for Using Regions and AZs
💡 Choose the right region based on latency, cost, and compliance.
💡 Deploy across multiple AZs to ensure high availability.
💡 Use AWS services like Route 53, Auto Scaling, and Load Balancers to manage traffic and improve reliability.

🔹 Final Thoughts
✔️ AWS Regions provide geographical isolation for resources.
✔️ Availability Zones ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
✔️ Using multiple AZs prevents downtime and improves application resilience.

That’s how AWS Regions and Availability Zones help you build scalable and reliable cloud applications! 🚀








=================================================
Play with EC2
=================================================


"Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel.
In today’s video, we’re talking about EC2—also known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
If you're new to AWS or just want to understand EC2 better, you're in the right place!"

"So, what is EC2?
EC2 instances are basically virtual machines that you can use to host applications, process data, and run various computing tasks.
The best part? EC2 provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud."

"That means you can scale up or down based on your needs—whether you’re running a small website or a large enterprise application."

"If you want to dive deeper into EC2, AWS has a great documentation page with detailed information.
Check it out here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html
I’ll also drop the link in the description below."




1:30
=======================
Run an EC2:

Here’s how you can do it step by step."

"First, go to the EC2 dashboard and click 'Launch Instance'.
Give your instance a name."

"Next, select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
An AMI is like an operating system for your EC2 instance.
You can choose from public AMIs provided by AWS or create a custom one."

"Now, select the instance type.
EC2 offers different instance types optimized for various use cases, such as general-purpose computing, memory-intensive tasks, or storage-optimized applications."

"After that, create or select a key pair.
This is essential for securely accessing your instance.
AWS stores the public key, and you need to keep the private key safe."

"Next, configure networking and security settings.
You can set up security groups and VPC settings to control inbound and outbound traffic.
We have an entire video covering networking and security, so check that out for a deeper understanding."

"Then, configure storage as needed.
Here, you can specify the storage type and size for your instance."

"Finally, explore additional options such as domain name joining, OS profiling, purchasing options, shutdown behavior, and user data for bootstrapping scripts."

"Once everything is set, click 'Launch'.
Your EC2 instance is now up and running!"







12:10
===============================
"Let’s talk about EC2 network settings, specifically Security Groups and VPCs."

"A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instance.
It controls both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level."

"Security Groups operate at the instance level, not the subnet level.
They are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed."

"You can define rules based on IP addresses, protocols, and port ranges to control traffic.
By default, all inbound traffic is denied, while all outbound traffic is allowed."

"Every EC2 instance must be associated with at least one Security Group,
and each Security Group belongs to a specific VPC."

"That’s a quick overview of Security Groups!





17:10
========================
"You can create a Security Group based on your specific requirements.
This includes defining rules for port access, allowed protocols, and other security policies."

"We’ll cover security settings in more detail in an upcoming video,
where we’ll show how to apply rules for different purposes,
such as port restrictions, protocol restrictions, and more."




21:00
===================
"By default, AWS provides a Security Group, but we’re not going to use it.
Instead, we’ll create a new Security Group."

"To do this:

Give the Security Group a name and an optional description.
Select a VPC; in this case, we’ll use the default one."
"Next, we’ll define rules for this Security Group:

First, an inbound rule: Allow HTTP traffic on port 80.
For the outbound rule, we’ll allow all traffic.
That’s it! Security Group creation is done."
"Now, we need to attach this Security Group to our EC2 instance.
Just refresh the settings, and we’ll see the new Security Group—let’s add it."

"Next, we configure storage for the server.
The default storage value is enough for now, so we’ll leave it as is."

"For additional configurations, we’ll also leave the default settings."

"Now, let’s add some Bootstrap data.
Since it depends on our instance’s OS image, we’ll keep it simple."

"The script will:

Update the system
Install the Nginx package
Run a basic 'Hello World' server"
"Finally, let’s launch the instance!"




29:00
=======================
"Our EC2 instance is launching, and it will take a few seconds.
To see details about this instance, we can simply select it."

"Here, we can check important configurations like:

Security Group
Network settings
Storage type
Monitoring details"
"By default, AWS provides a public IP and DNS for accessing the instance.
It also has a unique private IP, and both are fully customizable."

"Now, let’s access our brand-new AWS server using the public domain.
Just copy the public IP or DNS and open it in a browser."

"And there it is! Our expected server is up and running with its home page."






32:00
==========================
"Let’s talk about AWS VPC."

"Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a virtual network in the cloud.
It allows you to define your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables."

"VPCs define the overall network structure, while Security Groups act as firewalls for the instances within that VPC."

"Now, let’s log in to our running EC2 instance using SSH."

"To do this, we need a key pair (.pem file) and a shell terminal.
The SSH command looks like this:"

$ ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-public-ip
"The username depends on the instance’s OS image, and we use the instance’s public IP."

"We can also transfer files from our local PC to the EC2 instance using SCP:"

$ scp -i your-key.pem /path/to/local/file.txt ubuntu@ec2-public-ip:/path/to/ec2/
"Let’s try logging in!"

"But we get a timeout error—why?
Because our Security Group doesn’t have an inbound rule allowing SSH on port 22."

"Let’s fix this by updating the Security Group to allow SSH access."
"Done! Now, let’s try again."

"Yes, we are logged into our AWS EC2 instance!"

"Now, let’s install net-tools, but we see that the package is missing.
No problem—let’s install it. Done!"

"Next, let’s update our Nginx home page, refresh the browser, and yes! We see the updated page."

"We can also copy any file from our local PC to the EC2 instance using SCP.
This is useful when we need to transfer application files, like JAR or WAR files."

"Let’s try copying an index.html file to our EC2 instance:"

$ scp -i your-key.pem index.html ubuntu@ec2-public-ip:/var/www/html/
"The copy is done! Now, let’s refresh our EC2 page, and there it is—our expected result."





47:10
====================


"Now, let’s talk about the EC2 pricing model."

"EC2 pricing includes several components:"

Instance Types
On-Demand Instances
Reserved Instances
Spot Instances
Dedicated Hosts
Savings Plans
Data Transfer
"For more details, check the AWS pricing documentation:
🔗 AWS EC2 Pricing"

Instance Types:
"AWS offers different instance types, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized.
Each type has its own pricing based on hardware specifications and performance."

On-Demand Instances:
"With on-demand instances, you pay for compute capacity on an hourly or per-second basis.
This is flexible but can be costly for long-term usage."

Reserved Instances:
"Reserved instances offer significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.
However, they require a commitment of 1 or 3 years."

Spot Instances:
"Spot instances let you bid for unused EC2 capacity, potentially saving a lot of costs.
However, AWS can terminate these instances with short notice."

Dedicated Hosts:
"If you need a physical EC2 server for compliance or licensing reasons, you can use dedicated hosts.
You pay for the entire host, regardless of how many instances are running on it."

Savings Plans:
"A flexible pricing model that provides cost savings in exchange for a usage commitment (measured in $/hr) over 1 or 3 years.
Savings Plans offer lower prices compared to on-demand instances."

Data Transfer:
"Additional costs apply for data transfers between EC2 instances and the internet, as well as transfers between AWS regions."

8) AWS Storage services and Database in AWS 
=================================================

"Welcome to today’s video!
In this session, we’ll be diving into AWS Storage Services and Databases and how they can help you build scalable, reliable, and cost-effective storage solutions for your applications."

"AWS offers a wide range of storage options that can be tailored to meet different needs, from simple file storage to complex database management."

Key AWS Storage Services
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
"Amazon S3 is an object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data, from anywhere on the web.
With high scalability, durability, and low latency, it’s ideal for backups, big data storage, and content distribution.

S3 supports multiple storage classes, such as:

Standard: For frequently accessed data.
Intelligent-Tiering: For data with unpredictable access patterns.
Glacier: For archiving and long-term data storage.
Each storage class offers different levels of durability, availability, and cost efficiency, which makes it a great choice for a variety of use cases."

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
"Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
EBS allows for persistent storage where data remains available even when an instance is stopped.

EBS is great for:

Databases: For transactional workloads requiring high-performance storage.
Application storage: For applications requiring low-latency access to data.
EBS supports different volume types, including:

General Purpose SSD (gp3): For most workloads.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2): For high-performance workloads.
Magnetic volumes: For low-cost, infrequent access."
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
"Amazon EFS provides scalable, fully managed file storage for EC2 instances.
It supports the NFS protocol, which allows EC2 instances to share file storage. This makes it easy for applications to scale across multiple instances without worrying about the complexity of managing file systems.

EFS automatically scales storage as needed, providing cost-effective options for:

Content management systems.
Big data analytics.
Web servers that require shared access to files across instances."
AWS Storage Gateway
"AWS Storage Gateway bridges the gap between on-premises data and cloud storage.
It offers hybrid storage solutions for organizations that need to integrate their on-prem applications with AWS cloud storage.

You can use it to:

Store backups in S3 while keeping on-prem data accessible.
Provide low-latency access to data stored in the cloud.
Storage Gateway supports multiple configurations, including File Gateway, Tape Gateway, and Volume Gateway, each optimized for specific use cases."

Amazon CloudFront
"Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of content, including S3 data, to end users globally.

Although not a traditional storage service, CloudFront is often used to speed up the delivery of static content such as:

Web pages.
Images.
Video files.
By caching content at edge locations closer to the user, CloudFront reduces latency and speeds up access."

AWS Snow Family
"The AWS Snow Family is a set of physical devices designed to help organizations move large amounts of data into and out of AWS when high-speed internet transfer isn’t an option.

This includes devices like AWS Snowcone, Snowball, and Snowmobile, each designed for different data sizes and transfer needs.
For example, Snowball can handle up to 50TB of data, while Snowmobile can move exabytes of data.

The Snow Family is ideal for:

Disaster recovery.
Data center migrations.
Handling data at remote locations with no internet access."
AWS Databases
"In addition to storage services, AWS also offers a range of managed database services, including:

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): A fully managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
Amazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL service designed for high-performance, scalable applications.
Amazon Redshift: A data warehousing service for analyzing large datasets.
Amazon Aurora: A MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible database built for cloud performance.
These database services make it easy to run mission-critical applications with scalability, high availability, and automatic backups."

💡 In summary, AWS provides a comprehensive suite of storage and database solutions designed to meet the needs of various workloads.
Whether you need block storage, object storage, file systems, or even physical data migration, AWS has you covered with solutions that offer flexibility, cost efficiency, and scalability.





10:30
====================
"You can get more details about these storage devices in the official AWS documentation.

AWS Storage Services Documentation: AWS Storage Services

Let's open and explore the document.

A quick note:
You don’t need to learn about every single AWS storage service in-depth for everyday work.
In real-world scenarios, you'll likely only need to work with two or three of the most commonly used services.

Whenever you need to dive deeper into a particular storage service, it's best to refer to the official documentation.
This will help you understand the specific features, configurations, and best practices for the service you're working with.






12:30
======================
Now, let's talk about Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):

S3 Buckets are public cloud storage containers for objects stored in S3.
You can think of S3 buckets as file folders where you store your objects. It's a powerful object storage service.

Using S3 Buckets for Static Website Hosting:

You can host a static website directly from an S3 bucket.
Simply upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and S3 will serve them to your users as a fully functional static site.

Permissions required for S3:

Bucket must have public access:
The bucket must allow public access to enable others to view the content, especially for use cases like static website hosting.

Add a bucket policy for object access:
You must configure the correct bucket policy to ensure objects are accessible based on the desired level of permissions.

Let’s talk about S3 Public Access:

To enable public access to your S3 bucket and allow others to access the stored objects, we need to adjust the Bucket Policy.

We'll see how to add this in the Bucket Policy in the next steps.






15:20
=====================
Let's create a bucket and go through the process step by step:

Step 1: Log in to AWS Console

First, log in to your AWS Management Console and search for S3 in the search bar.
Step 2: Create a New Bucket

Select a Region: Choose a region for your bucket. It's recommended to select a region geographically closer to your users or where you expect most of the traffic.

Bucket Name:

Provide a unique name for the bucket.
Bucket names must be globally unique across AWS, so if someone else has already taken your preferred name, you will get a warning and need to select another one.
Consider including your project name or a descriptive term in the bucket name to help identify its purpose easily.
Step 3: Configure Bucket Settings

Public Access:

Decide if you want to share the contents of the bucket publicly.
If you plan to share the bucket via a URL (for example, for a website), you will need to disable public access, which is turned on by default. Uncheck the box for public access to allow everyone to access the content.
Be careful with making a bucket public, as this can expose sensitive data unintentionally.
Bucket Versioning:

Versioning is a way of keeping track of changes to the objects stored in the bucket.
When enabled, S3 will store every version of an object. If you update a file, the previous version is still accessible.
For simplicity, we will leave this disabled for now, but enabling it could be helpful if you want to maintain previous versions of objects automatically.
Encryption:

AWS provides options for encrypting your stored data. By default, the bucket will not have encryption enabled.
You can leave this setting disabled for now or choose Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) for automatic encryption at rest.
Step 4: Create the Bucket

Once all the settings are configured, click on Create Bucket.
You will see a success message once the bucket is created.
Step 5: Bucket Overview

Your new bucket (in this case, named my-image) will now appear in the S3 dashboard.
Since it’s a newly created bucket, it will be empty.
Step 6: Upload an Image File

To upload a file, select the Upload button from your bucket page.
Choose the file you want to upload (for example, an image file).
Once selected, click Upload and wait for it to complete.
Step 7: File Access

After uploading, the file will now be listed under your bucket's contents.
You can now download the file, share its URL, or access it using the S3 API.
With these steps, you've successfully created an S3 bucket, uploaded a file, and learned how to manage its accessibility and versioning. This is the foundation of how you can store and serve files in AWS S3.





21:40
==================
Let's set up a bucket as a static website step by step:

Step 1: Create a New Bucket

Follow the same process to create a bucket as you did previously.
Bucket Name: Choose a unique name for your bucket.
Region: Select the desired region where you want the bucket to be created.
After filling in the required details, click on Create to create the bucket.

Step 2: Make the Bucket Public

To configure the bucket for static website hosting, you need to do the following:

Enable Public Access:

The bucket must be accessible to the public, so ensure that public access is allowed.
This is typically disabled by default for security reasons, but for static website hosting, you need to enable public access.
Add Bucket Policy for Object Access:

You need to add a policy to allow public access to the objects within the bucket.
This can be done by adding a bucket policy that grants the necessary permissions for public read access to the files stored within the bucket.
Step 3: Upload Static Files

After setting the bucket for public access, upload your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
For example, upload your homepage index.html file, along with other necessary files (e.g., styles.css, logo.png).
Click Upload, select the files from your local system, and finish the upload process.
Step 4: Set the Index File

After uploading the files, select your index.html file and mark it as the index document for your static website. This file will be the first one displayed when someone accesses your website.
Step 5: Update the Bucket Policy

To make the bucket publicly accessible, you will need to add a Bucket Policy.
You can find the example policy in AWS documentation. The policy should allow read access to all objects within the bucket.
Update the bucket policy using a JSON file. Here’s an example of what the policy might look like:


Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name.
Save the policy, and the bucket will now be publicly accessible.
Step 6: Access the Static Website

After applying the policy, your static website should be accessible via a public URL.

AWS S3 provides a public URL for your bucket, which you can find in the Bucket Overview section. The URL will look like this:


http://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com
Open the URL in a browser, and you should see your static website live.

Step 7: (Optional) Use a Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain (e.g., www.yourwebsite.com), you can configure Amazon Route 53 or another DNS provider to point to your S3 static website URL.
This step involves creating a CNAME record in your DNS settings to route traffic from your domain to the S3 URL.
Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a static website on AWS S3 without the need for a server!






29:40
===========================
Now, let's talk about Databases in AWS.

AWS offers a variety of database solutions to meet different needs. One of the most popular offerings is Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), which supports several database engines:

Amazon RDS Engines: These include popular relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle. You can run and manage these engines on AWS easily.
Amazon Aurora: This is a fully managed, MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database that is designed to offer high performance and availability with lower costs compared to traditional database engines.
AWS provides a wide range of database engines, so you can choose the one that fits your needs, whether you're running MySQL, Oracle, or another engine. All the commonly known database engines are available in AWS, giving you flexibility.

Now, if you’ve created any resources that you no longer need, such as an S3 bucket, it’s a good practice to clean them up to avoid unnecessary costs.

Deleting the S3 Buckets

Navigate to S3 Console: Go to your AWS S3 dashboard.
Select Buckets: You’ll see all your buckets listed there.
Choose Buckets to Delete: Select the buckets that you no longer need.
Delete Buckets: For each bucket, you’ll need to confirm the deletion by following the prompts.
This helps to avoid unnecessary charges for unused resources!






33:30
=================================
Let's dive deeper into working with AWS RDS (Relational Database Service). This service makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud.

Steps to Set Up a MySQL Database on AWS RDS:
Log into AWS Console and Search for RDS:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
In the search bar, type RDS and select RDS from the results.
Create a MySQL Database Instance:

Under the Databases section, click Create database.
Choose the MySQL engine from the list of database engines available. AWS RDS supports a variety of engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, and more.
Select the Free Tier template (if eligible), which is perfect for small, cost-effective databases.
Set Database Configuration:

Database Name: Choose a name for your database. If you leave it blank, AWS will assign a default name.
Master Username: Set the Root Username for the database (e.g., admin or any username you prefer).
Master Password: Enter a password for the root user. Ensure this password is strong and secure.
For example:

Master Username: admin
Master Password: mysecurepassword123
Select Storage:

The Free Tier offers 20GB of storage. If you don’t need more storage initially, keep it at the default.
AWS automatically scales the storage as needed, but make sure you’re comfortable with the free-tier limits if you're on a budget.
Enable Public Access:

If you want to access the database from outside the AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), make sure to enable Public Accessibility. This will assign a public IP to the instance, allowing it to be accessed externally.
If you're unsure, it's best to leave it disabled to keep it secure.
VPC & Security Group Setup:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): AWS provides default VPCs that you can use. Choose the default one or create a custom VPC if needed.
Security Group: Select an existing security group or create a new one that allows inbound traffic on port 3306 (the default port for MySQL).
For security, allow only trusted IPs or other services within the same VPC to access your database.
Creating and Configuring Security Group for Database Access:
Security Group Configuration:
When creating a new Security Group for the database, add inbound rules for port 3306 (MySQL’s default port).
Add outbound rules to allow the database to communicate with the internet or other services if required.
Example:
Inbound Rule:
Type: MySQL/Aurora
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 3306
Source: Your IP or range (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for global access but this should be avoided for security reasons).
Associate Security Group:
After creating the security group, associate it with your RDS instance during the setup process.
Finalizing the Database Creation:
Launch Database Instance:
After configuring the database settings, security group, and VPC, click on the Create database button.
The database instance will take a few minutes to launch. Once it's up, you can see the database in the RDS Dashboard with the status Available.
Accessing the Database:
Connecting to RDS:

Get RDS Endpoint: Once the instance is running, go to the RDS Dashboard, select your database, and find the Endpoint URL (this is the address you’ll use to connect).
Example: mydbinstance.c6c8iw2ckd28.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
Database Client:

Use a database client like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or HeidiSQL to connect.
In the client:
Host: Use the RDS Endpoint.
Port: 3306 (default for MySQL).
Username: Use the Master Username you created earlier (e.g., admin).
Password: Use the Master Password you set.
Test the connection to make sure everything is working properly.
Once connected, you can interact with the database like you would with any MySQL instance.

Cleanup:
Deleting the Database:

After you’ve finished working with the RDS instance and practicing, it’s important to delete the instance to avoid unnecessary costs.
In the RDS Dashboard, select your database instance and click on Delete.
AWS will ask if you want to take a snapshot before deletion (optional).
Click Continue and confirm deletion.
Remove Security Groups & Other Resources:

Optionally, remove any custom security groups or other resources you no longer need to keep your environment clean.
Key Tips:
Cost Management: Always monitor the free-tier usage to ensure you're not exceeding limits, especially with database storage, as RDS can quickly scale.
Backups: Regularly back up your database using Automated Backups or Manual Snapshots for disaster recovery.
Security: Use IAM roles and Security Groups to tightly control access to your RDS instance.
By following these steps, you can easily set up, connect to, and manage a MySQL database in AWS RDS for both development and production environments.






=================================================
ELB, ASG
=================================================
 in this tutorial we will talking about ELB, ASG
 
 Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, 
 such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 
 This is how it blance the traffice and load.


It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. 
AwS az base datahouse what is geographically different and we diploy aour same application 
to multiple az this is how we can manage our application high availability.

the deployment application can be ec2, container, ipaddress etc deployed in different az.


5:30
================
Now talking about asg.
AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.
Automatically launch or terminate EC2 instances based on user-defined policies, health status checks, and schedules resources.


one of the main gole of asg is resource best utilization and cost mininization and sacle instance base on traffice 
and this will be automatically.
We can set asg policy diffeetnt way like: if the instance cpu or memeory uses is exceed then 80% then it will bring more instance.

againe uses below 30% then stope some instance  scale downe when running multiple replica of one instance.
this is how actually asg work base on difined policy.



8:30
================
Type Of AWS ELB:
AWS Elastic Load Balancer | AWS Load Balancer Types
There are multiple types of AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), including Application Load Balancer (ALB),
Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer (CLB). 


Application Load Balancers: Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic. 
Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers are used to route TCP (or Layer 4) traffic.


Network Load Balancer: NLB is a layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple targets, 
such as EC2, containers, and IP addresses, within one or more Availability Zones. It can handle millions of requests per second. 


Gateway Load Balancer: GLB helps you easily deploy, scale, and manage your third-party virtual appliances. 
It gives you one gateway for distributing traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up or down, based on demand. 


Classic Load Balancer: You can load balance HTTP/HTTPS applications and use Layer 7-specific features, also You can also use Layer 4 
load balancing for applications on the TCP protocol using CLB.

AWS recommend Application Load Balancer for Layer 7 traffic and Network Load Balancer for Layer 4 traffic.



13:20
==========================
lets run an ALB and see on handon.

see this image we will make a asg system this image shows architecture.

to do that we need multiple targate or instance os we need first Lunch Multiple EC2.
lets do it.

we need to security group one for alb what is allow traffice from user to alb and one for instances and this one will be from alb to instance.
so lets difine security grpup and its in boud and outbound  rule.

then Create a target group for request. 
    waht is a grpup of same application instance.
to do that:
first select instance.
give a targate grpup name, set instance port number.


then set healtch check path difine with port.
we can set threshold for this.






Finally crate a Load balancer.

clieck crate Load balanceer.

here show this 4 type load balanceer, remember network loadbalancer not free available on this free tier period.
Application has and its good anough for lerning perpose.

lets run a ALB.to do thsat 

click crate button, give a name.

set request source what is in our case internate facing then set az here we have same az but producation is food differtn az.

set security group what we created.

and finally crerate.
our albe booting up its take few time.


31:30
====================
in this time lets talk about asg.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the mini/Max number of instances in each Auto Scaling group.


For example, the following Auto Scaling group has a minimum size of one instance, a desired capacity of two instances, and a maximum size of four instances.



this is the docuemnt link:
AWS ASG doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html


33:30
=====================
alb provisioning done it now up and runnign, let check it out.

to access it we can use thsi publick dns.

go to browser, open it.
ok we get access show s server.

lets refresh the borwser what will make multiple request and alb balance it to our server-1 and server-2 instance.
yes ! its work ! it blance the requst on two services. her by default it user round robin algorithm.


Ok we done here. thsi is how actually alb as asg work.







=================================================
10 | AWS Managed Services | AWS Serverless
=================================================
we talking today about AWS Managed Services | AWS Serverless.

so first AWS Managed Services:

AWS Managed Services aims to simplify the management of AWS infrastructure by providing a set of automated tools and processes. 

It helps organizations achieve operational excellence by handling routine tasks such as patch management, 
monitoring, security, and backups. 



lets say an exaple of database: 
if we need to run a database what we need to do for that if we do manually:
    run a vm,install os, install mysql, immplement security abd backup system a lot of task.
    
in the from of manage serices this all give all thsi from of me aws.
we just neeed run a rds and aws do all thing for me.

6:30
================
lets talk about AWS Serverless:
Instead of provisioning and managing servers AWS Serverless refers to a computing model where you can build and run 
applications without managing servers. 

In a serverless architecture automatically handles the infrastructure for you. 



aws provide many serverless servicea like:

AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You upload your code, and Lambda automatically scales and executes.

Amazon API Gateway: This service allows you to create, publish, and manage APIs API at any scale. 
With API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs that integrate with Lambda functions, enabling you to build serverless backend services for your applications.
