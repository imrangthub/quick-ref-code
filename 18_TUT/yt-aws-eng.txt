Cloud Computing Explained:
Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources via the internet, including applications, servers, storage, databases, and software.

It offers flexible services and hardware for businesses and personal useâ€”just as much as you need.

ðŸ’¡ Pay-as-you-go Model: You only pay for what you use.
If youâ€™re not using resources, you wonâ€™t be billed!

Simple, scalable, and cost-efficient! ðŸš€

Cloud Service Models & Key Characteristics Explained

Letâ€™s talk about Cloud Service Models:

âœ… IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) â€“ Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking.

âœ… PaaS (Platform as a Service) â€“ Offers a complete platform that includes infrastructure and tools to develop applications.

âœ… SaaS (Software as a Service) â€“ Delivers software applications over the internet, no installation required!

AWS as a Cloud Provider
AWS is one of the top cloud providers out there, offering a wide range of services.

Now, letâ€™s explore Key Characteristics of Cloud Services:

ðŸ”¹ On-Demand Self-Service â€“ You can provision and manage resources as needed, without any intervention from the service provider.

ðŸ”¹ Broad Network Access â€“ Cloud services are accessible from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.

ðŸ”¹ Rapid Elasticity â€“ Scale your resources up or down quickly based on your needs, perfect for handling traffic spikes.

ðŸ”¹ Measured Service â€“ Resources are metered, so youâ€™re billed based on actual usage.

AWS Cost Explorer
With AWS, you can easily check your costs:

Assess costs for specific services based on your usage.
Choose regions and services, and see how they impact the cost.
Generate a simple bill to get an idea of how much youâ€™ll pay for your system.
With this, you can predict costs and manage your cloud budget effectively. ðŸš€

===============
AWS offers over 200 different services across various categories like computing, storage, databases, machine learning, security, networking, and more!

Basic AWS Services
âœ… Compute Services:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) â€“ Scalable virtual servers in the cloud for running applications and workloads.
âœ… Networking:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) â€“ Create isolated sections of the AWS Cloud for secure networking.
Route 53 â€“ Scalable and highly available DNS web service.
âœ… Storage & Content Delivery:

S3 (Simple Storage Service) â€“ Scalable and highly durable object storage.
EBS (Elastic Block Store) â€“ Block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.
Glacier â€“ Low-cost, long-term archival storage.
CloudFront â€“ CDN service for securely delivering data, videos, apps, and APIs globally.
âœ… Databases:

RDS (Relational Database Service) â€“ Managed relational databases supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
DynamoDB â€“ Fully managed NoSQL database with automatic scaling.
These services are the building blocks for deploying powerful applications on AWS. ðŸš€
