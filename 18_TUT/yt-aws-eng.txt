================================
"Hey everyone! In this video, we’ll explore how AWS Free Tier works and what policies you need to be aware of.
Let’s dive in!"



[WHAT IS AWS FREE TIER?]
✅ AWS Free Tier gives you 1 year of free access to select AWS services.
✅ Each service has different limits and policies.
✅ You can find full details on the AWS website or by searching on Google.

[IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW]
✅ Watch your usage carefully to avoid unexpected charges.
✅ Example: EC2 (Virtual Machine) allows 720 hours per month under Free Tier.
✅ If you don’t stop the service, even after signing out or closing your browser, it keeps running on AWS servers, and you might exceed your Free Tier limit.

[LIMITATIONS]
✅ Not all AWS services are included in Free Tier.
✅ Some services, like EC2, only offer specific instance types (CPU, memory).
✅ Always check AWS documentation for clear details.

"That’s how AWS Free Tier works!
In the next video, we’ll start using AWS services hands-on.







=================================================

=================================================
Cost And Budgets
=================================================
In this tutorial, we will talk about Cost and Budgets in AWS.

AWS provides a dashboard called Cost Management, where you can see all AWS-related costs in one place.

Let's check it out. Open the Cost Management dashboard.

Here, you can see the individual costs for each service, how much is being consumed, and other details.

You can also estimate future costs using the AWS My Estimation menu.

For example, if you need a database server or any other service, you can calculate how much the bill will be based on usage and time.

This helps in planning your AWS budget effectively.






2:20
==============
Let's calculate the bill for an EC2 service.

1️⃣ Select EC2 from the services list.
2️⃣ Choose a region—AWS pricing varies by region for the same server.

We will discuss regions and transactions in more detail later.

Now, select the instance family based on your server requirements.

Payment Options
AWS offers different payment options, each with different cost-saving benefits.

Additional Costs
You can add extra storage volumes, monitoring tools, etc., which increase the service cost.

AWS Budget Notifications
AWS provides a notification system for budget tracking.

You can set a cost threshold.
If the cost exceeds the threshold, AWS sends alerts via SMS, email, etc.
You can take actions like stopping a service or starting another based on notifications.
Creating a Budget
You can create a budget for a single service or multiple services.
AWS Budget helps you track and control your personal or company expenses.

You can also save budgets and create templates for frequent use.

For learning purposes, we can set a $0 or $1 budget to minimize costs and prevent accidental charges.











=================================================
User, Role and IAM User
=================================================
In this tutorial, we will discuss AWS Users, IAM Roles, and IAM Users—their differences, best practices, and how they help manage access in AWS.

1️⃣ AWS Root User
The Root User is created when you sign up for an AWS account.
It has full control over all AWS services and resources.
Best Practice: Avoid using the root user for daily tasks. Instead, create IAM users with specific permissions.
2️⃣ AWS IAM Users (Identity and Access Management)
IAM users have unique credentials (username/password or access keys).
They can have custom permissions to access only the necessary AWS resources.
Common Use Cases:
Developers accessing specific AWS services.
Admin users managing AWS accounts.
Applications using access keys for authentication.
Security Best Practices:
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Assign least privilege permissions—only what is required.
Rotate access keys regularly to prevent security risks.
3️⃣ AWS IAM Roles
IAM roles allow AWS services or users to assume temporary access permissions.
Unlike IAM users, roles do not require long-term credentials.
Common Use Cases:
EC2 instances accessing S3 without storing credentials.
Lambda functions interacting with databases.
Federated access for users logging in via external identity providers.
4️⃣ AWS Federated Users
These are users who log in using an external identity provider (e.g., Active Directory, Google, Facebook).
They do not need IAM user accounts but gain access through IAM roles.
Useful for large enterprises with existing authentication systems.
5️⃣ AWS Account
An AWS account represents a unique business or organization within AWS.
It includes:
Billing and resource management.
Security and identity settings.
Multiple IAM users and roles under one account.
🔹 Key Takeaways
✔️ Use the root user only for critical tasks, like billing or security configurations.
✔️ Create IAM users for team members and assign permissions carefully.
✔️ Use IAM roles to grant temporary access instead of long-term credentials.
✔️ Enable MFA and follow security best practices to protect your AWS environment.

Managing users, roles, and permissions properly helps secure your AWS infrastructure while ensuring smooth operations.







3:30
====================

We will also learn how to assign permissions and sign in as an IAM user step by step.

1️⃣ What is an IAM User?
An IAM (Identity and Access Management) user is a secure way to allow individuals or applications to access AWS services without using the root account.

✅ Each IAM user has specific credentials (username/password or access keys).
✅ Users can have custom permissions to access only the required AWS services.
✅ Using IAM users ensures better security and access control.

📌 Example:

A developer may have access to EC2 but not billing.
A finance team may have access to AWS billing but not EC2 instances.
2️⃣ IAM Policies – Controlling Access
IAM policies define what an IAM user, group, or role is allowed or denied to do in AWS.
A policy consists of statements that specify:
✔️ Allowed or denied actions (e.g., Start EC2, Read S3 bucket).
✔️ Resources on which these actions apply (e.g., specific S3 buckets).
✔️ Conditions for access (e.g., allowed only from a certain IP address).

Types of IAM Policies
🔹 AWS Managed Policies – Predefined by AWS for common use cases.
🔹 Customer Managed Policies – Custom policies created by users.
🔹 Inline Policies – Directly attached to a single IAM user, group, or role.

📌 Example Policy (Allow access to S3):

3️⃣ IAM Groups – Simplifying User Management
IAM Groups allow you to assign policies to multiple users at once, instead of assigning permissions individually.

✔️ Helps organize users based on their roles.
✔️ Users in a group inherit all the group permissions.
✔️ Makes permission management easier when onboarding new users.

📌 Example Groups:

Developers Group – Can access EC2, RDS, S3.
Admins Group – Full access to AWS resources.
Read-Only Group – Can only view AWS services but cannot modify them.
4️⃣ Step-by-Step: Creating an IAM Policy and Group
Now, let’s create an IAM policy and a user group and assign them to an IAM user.
📺 Watch the step-by-step process on the screen!

🔹 Step 1: Go to the IAM Management Console.
🔹 Step 2: Create a new policy with required permissions.
🔹 Step 3: Create an IAM group and attach the policy.
🔹 Step 4: Add an IAM user to the group.
🔹 Step 5: Assign necessary credentials.

5️⃣ Signing in as an IAM User
Once permissions and groups are assigned, we will sign in as the IAM user and verify access.

📌 IAM User Login Steps:
1️⃣ Open the AWS IAM Sign-In page.
2️⃣ Enter the IAM user credentials (username & password).
3️⃣ Verify that access is restricted based on permissions.

✅ IAM users help maintain secure and controlled access to AWS resources.
✅ Policies and groups simplify management, making it easy to assign permissions to multiple users.

🔹 Final Thoughts
✔️ Use IAM Users instead of the root user for daily tasks.
✔️ Apply least privilege when assigning permissions.
✔️ Use IAM Groups to manage multiple users efficiently.
✔️ Regularly review IAM Policies to maintain security.

That’s how AWS IAM Users, Policies, and Groups work!
🚀 Stay secure and manage access the right way!







=================================================
AWS Architecture, Regions and AZ
=================================================

In this tutorial, we will talk about AWS Architecture, Regions, and Availability Zones (AZs).
Understanding these concepts is essential for building scalable, reliable, and high-performance applications in the cloud.

1️⃣ AWS Architecture – Key Concepts
AWS is designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability through:

✔️ Regions – Independent geographical locations.
✔️ Availability Zones (AZs) – Data centers within a region.

📌 AWS Documentation:
Regions & Availability Zones

2️⃣ What is an AWS Region?
A Region is a geographically isolated area where AWS resources are hosted.

✅ Each region is independent to ensure reliability.
✅ Helps businesses deploy applications close to their customers for better performance.
✅ Regions are separated to prevent failures from affecting global AWS services.

📌 Example AWS Regions:

us-east-1 (Virginia, USA)
eu-west-1 (Ireland)
ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
🔹 Choosing the right region depends on latency, compliance, and cost.

3️⃣ What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?
An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center or a collection of data centers within a region.

✅ Each region has multiple AZs to ensure redundancy.
✅ AZs are connected via low-latency networks.
✅ If one AZ fails, AWS automatically shifts workloads to another AZ.

📌 Example:
A region like us-east-1 has multiple AZs:

us-east-1a
us-east-1b
us-east-1c
🔹 Best Practice: Always deploy applications across multiple AZs for high availability.

4️⃣ Why Are AWS Regions and AZs Important?
AWS Regions and Availability Zones are critical for:

✔️ Fault Tolerance – Prevents system failures by distributing workloads.
✔️ Scalability – Allows businesses to expand without downtime.
✔️ Disaster Recovery – Ensures data is safe even if one AZ goes down.
✔️ High Performance – Reduces latency by serving users from the nearest region.

5️⃣ Best Practices for Using Regions and AZs
💡 Choose the right region based on latency, cost, and compliance.
💡 Deploy across multiple AZs to ensure high availability.
💡 Use AWS services like Route 53, Auto Scaling, and Load Balancers to manage traffic and improve reliability.

🔹 Final Thoughts
✔️ AWS Regions provide geographical isolation for resources.
✔️ Availability Zones ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
✔️ Using multiple AZs prevents downtime and improves application resilience.

That’s how AWS Regions and Availability Zones help you build scalable and reliable cloud applications! 🚀








=================================================
Play with EC2
=================================================


"Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel.
In today’s video, we’re talking about EC2—also known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
If you're new to AWS or just want to understand EC2 better, you're in the right place!"

"So, what is EC2?
EC2 instances are basically virtual machines that you can use to host applications, process data, and run various computing tasks.
The best part? EC2 provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud."

"That means you can scale up or down based on your needs—whether you’re running a small website or a large enterprise application."

"If you want to dive deeper into EC2, AWS has a great documentation page with detailed information.
Check it out here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html
I’ll also drop the link in the description below."




1:30
=======================
Run an EC2:

Here’s how you can do it step by step."

"First, go to the EC2 dashboard and click 'Launch Instance'.
Give your instance a name."

"Next, select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
An AMI is like an operating system for your EC2 instance.
You can choose from public AMIs provided by AWS or create a custom one."

"Now, select the instance type.
EC2 offers different instance types optimized for various use cases, such as general-purpose computing, memory-intensive tasks, or storage-optimized applications."

"After that, create or select a key pair.
This is essential for securely accessing your instance.
AWS stores the public key, and you need to keep the private key safe."

"Next, configure networking and security settings.
You can set up security groups and VPC settings to control inbound and outbound traffic.
We have an entire video covering networking and security, so check that out for a deeper understanding."

"Then, configure storage as needed.
Here, you can specify the storage type and size for your instance."

"Finally, explore additional options such as domain name joining, OS profiling, purchasing options, shutdown behavior, and user data for bootstrapping scripts."

"Once everything is set, click 'Launch'.
Your EC2 instance is now up and running!"







12:10
===============================
"Let’s talk about EC2 network settings, specifically Security Groups and VPCs."

"A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instance.
It controls both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level."

"Security Groups operate at the instance level, not the subnet level.
They are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed."

"You can define rules based on IP addresses, protocols, and port ranges to control traffic.
By default, all inbound traffic is denied, while all outbound traffic is allowed."

"Every EC2 instance must be associated with at least one Security Group,
and each Security Group belongs to a specific VPC."

"That’s a quick overview of Security Groups!





17:10
========================
"You can create a Security Group based on your specific requirements.
This includes defining rules for port access, allowed protocols, and other security policies."

"We’ll cover security settings in more detail in an upcoming video,
where we’ll show how to apply rules for different purposes,
such as port restrictions, protocol restrictions, and more."




21:00
===================
"By default, AWS provides a Security Group, but we’re not going to use it.
Instead, we’ll create a new Security Group."

"To do this:

Give the Security Group a name and an optional description.
Select a VPC; in this case, we’ll use the default one."
"Next, we’ll define rules for this Security Group:

First, an inbound rule: Allow HTTP traffic on port 80.
For the outbound rule, we’ll allow all traffic.
That’s it! Security Group creation is done."
"Now, we need to attach this Security Group to our EC2 instance.
Just refresh the settings, and we’ll see the new Security Group—let’s add it."

"Next, we configure storage for the server.
The default storage value is enough for now, so we’ll leave it as is."

"For additional configurations, we’ll also leave the default settings."

"Now, let’s add some Bootstrap data.
Since it depends on our instance’s OS image, we’ll keep it simple."

"The script will:

Update the system
Install the Nginx package
Run a basic 'Hello World' server"
"Finally, let’s launch the instance!"




29:00
=======================
"Our EC2 instance is launching, and it will take a few seconds.
To see details about this instance, we can simply select it."

"Here, we can check important configurations like:

Security Group
Network settings
Storage type
Monitoring details"
"By default, AWS provides a public IP and DNS for accessing the instance.
It also has a unique private IP, and both are fully customizable."

"Now, let’s access our brand-new AWS server using the public domain.
Just copy the public IP or DNS and open it in a browser."

"And there it is! Our expected server is up and running with its home page."






32:00
==========================
"Let’s talk about AWS VPC."

"Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a virtual network in the cloud.
It allows you to define your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables."

"VPCs define the overall network structure, while Security Groups act as firewalls for the instances within that VPC."

"Now, let’s log in to our running EC2 instance using SSH."

"To do this, we need a key pair (.pem file) and a shell terminal.
The SSH command looks like this:"

$ ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-public-ip
"The username depends on the instance’s OS image, and we use the instance’s public IP."

"We can also transfer files from our local PC to the EC2 instance using SCP:"

$ scp -i your-key.pem /path/to/local/file.txt ubuntu@ec2-public-ip:/path/to/ec2/
"Let’s try logging in!"

"But we get a timeout error—why?
Because our Security Group doesn’t have an inbound rule allowing SSH on port 22."

"Let’s fix this by updating the Security Group to allow SSH access."
"Done! Now, let’s try again."

"Yes, we are logged into our AWS EC2 instance!"

"Now, let’s install net-tools, but we see that the package is missing.
No problem—let’s install it. Done!"

"Next, let’s update our Nginx home page, refresh the browser, and yes! We see the updated page."

"We can also copy any file from our local PC to the EC2 instance using SCP.
This is useful when we need to transfer application files, like JAR or WAR files."

"Let’s try copying an index.html file to our EC2 instance:"

$ scp -i your-key.pem index.html ubuntu@ec2-public-ip:/var/www/html/
"The copy is done! Now, let’s refresh our EC2 page, and there it is—our expected result."





47:10
====================


"Now, let’s talk about the EC2 pricing model."

"EC2 pricing includes several components:"

Instance Types
On-Demand Instances
Reserved Instances
Spot Instances
Dedicated Hosts
Savings Plans
Data Transfer
"For more details, check the AWS pricing documentation:
🔗 AWS EC2 Pricing"

Instance Types:
"AWS offers different instance types, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized.
Each type has its own pricing based on hardware specifications and performance."

On-Demand Instances:
"With on-demand instances, you pay for compute capacity on an hourly or per-second basis.
This is flexible but can be costly for long-term usage."

Reserved Instances:
"Reserved instances offer significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.
However, they require a commitment of 1 or 3 years."

Spot Instances:
"Spot instances let you bid for unused EC2 capacity, potentially saving a lot of costs.
However, AWS can terminate these instances with short notice."

Dedicated Hosts:
"If you need a physical EC2 server for compliance or licensing reasons, you can use dedicated hosts.
You pay for the entire host, regardless of how many instances are running on it."

Savings Plans:
"A flexible pricing model that provides cost savings in exchange for a usage commitment (measured in $/hr) over 1 or 3 years.
Savings Plans offer lower prices compared to on-demand instances."

Data Transfer:
"Additional costs apply for data transfers between EC2 instances and the internet, as well as transfers between AWS regions."

10:30
====================
"You can get more details about these storage devices in the official AWS documentation.

AWS Storage Services Documentation: AWS Storage Services

Let's open and explore the document.

A quick note:
You don’t need to learn about every single AWS storage service in-depth for everyday work.
In real-world scenarios, you'll likely only need to work with two or three of the most commonly used services.

Whenever you need to dive deeper into a particular storage service, it's best to refer to the official documentation.
This will help you understand the specific features, configurations, and best practices for the service you're working with.






12:30
======================
Now, let's talk about Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):

S3 Buckets are public cloud storage containers for objects stored in S3.
You can think of S3 buckets as file folders where you store your objects. It's a powerful object storage service.

Using S3 Buckets for Static Website Hosting:

You can host a static website directly from an S3 bucket.
Simply upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and S3 will serve them to your users as a fully functional static site.

Permissions required for S3:

Bucket must have public access:
The bucket must allow public access to enable others to view the content, especially for use cases like static website hosting.

Add a bucket policy for object access:
You must configure the correct bucket policy to ensure objects are accessible based on the desired level of permissions.

Let’s talk about S3 Public Access:

To enable public access to your S3 bucket and allow others to access the stored objects, we need to adjust the Bucket Policy.

We'll see how to add this in the Bucket Policy in the next steps.






15:20
=====================
Let's create a bucket and go through the process step by step:

Step 1: Log in to AWS Console

First, log in to your AWS Management Console and search for S3 in the search bar.
Step 2: Create a New Bucket

Select a Region: Choose a region for your bucket. It's recommended to select a region geographically closer to your users or where you expect most of the traffic.

Bucket Name:

Provide a unique name for the bucket.
Bucket names must be globally unique across AWS, so if someone else has already taken your preferred name, you will get a warning and need to select another one.
Consider including your project name or a descriptive term in the bucket name to help identify its purpose easily.
Step 3: Configure Bucket Settings

Public Access:

Decide if you want to share the contents of the bucket publicly.
If you plan to share the bucket via a URL (for example, for a website), you will need to disable public access, which is turned on by default. Uncheck the box for public access to allow everyone to access the content.
Be careful with making a bucket public, as this can expose sensitive data unintentionally.
Bucket Versioning:

Versioning is a way of keeping track of changes to the objects stored in the bucket.
When enabled, S3 will store every version of an object. If you update a file, the previous version is still accessible.
For simplicity, we will leave this disabled for now, but enabling it could be helpful if you want to maintain previous versions of objects automatically.
Encryption:

AWS provides options for encrypting your stored data. By default, the bucket will not have encryption enabled.
You can leave this setting disabled for now or choose Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) for automatic encryption at rest.
Step 4: Create the Bucket

Once all the settings are configured, click on Create Bucket.
You will see a success message once the bucket is created.
Step 5: Bucket Overview

Your new bucket (in this case, named my-image) will now appear in the S3 dashboard.
Since it’s a newly created bucket, it will be empty.
Step 6: Upload an Image File

To upload a file, select the Upload button from your bucket page.
Choose the file you want to upload (for example, an image file).
Once selected, click Upload and wait for it to complete.
Step 7: File Access

After uploading, the file will now be listed under your bucket's contents.
You can now download the file, share its URL, or access it using the S3 API.
With these steps, you've successfully created an S3 bucket, uploaded a file, and learned how to manage its accessibility and versioning. This is the foundation of how you can store and serve files in AWS S3.





21:40
==================
Let's set up a bucket as a static website step by step:

Step 1: Create a New Bucket

Follow the same process to create a bucket as you did previously.
Bucket Name: Choose a unique name for your bucket.
Region: Select the desired region where you want the bucket to be created.
After filling in the required details, click on Create to create the bucket.

Step 2: Make the Bucket Public

To configure the bucket for static website hosting, you need to do the following:

Enable Public Access:

The bucket must be accessible to the public, so ensure that public access is allowed.
This is typically disabled by default for security reasons, but for static website hosting, you need to enable public access.
Add Bucket Policy for Object Access:

You need to add a policy to allow public access to the objects within the bucket.
This can be done by adding a bucket policy that grants the necessary permissions for public read access to the files stored within the bucket.
Step 3: Upload Static Files

After setting the bucket for public access, upload your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
For example, upload your homepage index.html file, along with other necessary files (e.g., styles.css, logo.png).
Click Upload, select the files from your local system, and finish the upload process.
Step 4: Set the Index File

After uploading the files, select your index.html file and mark it as the index document for your static website. This file will be the first one displayed when someone accesses your website.
Step 5: Update the Bucket Policy

To make the bucket publicly accessible, you will need to add a Bucket Policy.
You can find the example policy in AWS documentation. The policy should allow read access to all objects within the bucket.
Update the bucket policy using a JSON file. Here’s an example of what the policy might look like:


Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name.
Save the policy, and the bucket will now be publicly accessible.
Step 6: Access the Static Website

After applying the policy, your static website should be accessible via a public URL.

AWS S3 provides a public URL for your bucket, which you can find in the Bucket Overview section. The URL will look like this:


http://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com
Open the URL in a browser, and you should see your static website live.

Step 7: (Optional) Use a Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain (e.g., www.yourwebsite.com), you can configure Amazon Route 53 or another DNS provider to point to your S3 static website URL.
This step involves creating a CNAME record in your DNS settings to route traffic from your domain to the S3 URL.
Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a static website on AWS S3 without the need for a server!






29:40
===========================
Now, let's talk about Databases in AWS.

AWS offers a variety of database solutions to meet different needs. One of the most popular offerings is Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), which supports several database engines:

Amazon RDS Engines: These include popular relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle. You can run and manage these engines on AWS easily.
Amazon Aurora: This is a fully managed, MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database that is designed to offer high performance and availability with lower costs compared to traditional database engines.
AWS provides a wide range of database engines, so you can choose the one that fits your needs, whether you're running MySQL, Oracle, or another engine. All the commonly known database engines are available in AWS, giving you flexibility.

Now, if you’ve created any resources that you no longer need, such as an S3 bucket, it’s a good practice to clean them up to avoid unnecessary costs.

Deleting the S3 Buckets

Navigate to S3 Console: Go to your AWS S3 dashboard.
Select Buckets: You’ll see all your buckets listed there.
Choose Buckets to Delete: Select the buckets that you no longer need.
Delete Buckets: For each bucket, you’ll need to confirm the deletion by following the prompts.
This helps to avoid unnecessary charges for unused resources!






33:30
=================================
Let's dive deeper into working with AWS RDS (Relational Database Service). This service makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud.

Steps to Set Up a MySQL Database on AWS RDS:
Log into AWS Console and Search for RDS:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
In the search bar, type RDS and select RDS from the results.
Create a MySQL Database Instance:

Under the Databases section, click Create database.
Choose the MySQL engine from the list of database engines available. AWS RDS supports a variety of engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, and more.
Select the Free Tier template (if eligible), which is perfect for small, cost-effective databases.
Set Database Configuration:

Database Name: Choose a name for your database. If you leave it blank, AWS will assign a default name.
Master Username: Set the Root Username for the database (e.g., admin or any username you prefer).
Master Password: Enter a password for the root user. Ensure this password is strong and secure.
For example:

Master Username: admin
Master Password: mysecurepassword123
Select Storage:

The Free Tier offers 20GB of storage. If you don’t need more storage initially, keep it at the default.
AWS automatically scales the storage as needed, but make sure you’re comfortable with the free-tier limits if you're on a budget.
Enable Public Access:

If you want to access the database from outside the AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), make sure to enable Public Accessibility. This will assign a public IP to the instance, allowing it to be accessed externally.
If you're unsure, it's best to leave it disabled to keep it secure.
VPC & Security Group Setup:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): AWS provides default VPCs that you can use. Choose the default one or create a custom VPC if needed.
Security Group: Select an existing security group or create a new one that allows inbound traffic on port 3306 (the default port for MySQL).
For security, allow only trusted IPs or other services within the same VPC to access your database.
Creating and Configuring Security Group for Database Access:
Security Group Configuration:
When creating a new Security Group for the database, add inbound rules for port 3306 (MySQL’s default port).
Add outbound rules to allow the database to communicate with the internet or other services if required.
Example:
Inbound Rule:
Type: MySQL/Aurora
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 3306
Source: Your IP or range (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for global access but this should be avoided for security reasons).
Associate Security Group:
After creating the security group, associate it with your RDS instance during the setup process.
Finalizing the Database Creation:
Launch Database Instance:
After configuring the database settings, security group, and VPC, click on the Create database button.
The database instance will take a few minutes to launch. Once it's up, you can see the database in the RDS Dashboard with the status Available.
Accessing the Database:
Connecting to RDS:

Get RDS Endpoint: Once the instance is running, go to the RDS Dashboard, select your database, and find the Endpoint URL (this is the address you’ll use to connect).
Example: mydbinstance.c6c8iw2ckd28.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
Database Client:

Use a database client like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or HeidiSQL to connect.
In the client:
Host: Use the RDS Endpoint.
Port: 3306 (default for MySQL).
Username: Use the Master Username you created earlier (e.g., admin).
Password: Use the Master Password you set.
Test the connection to make sure everything is working properly.
Once connected, you can interact with the database like you would with any MySQL instance.

Cleanup:
Deleting the Database:

After you’ve finished working with the RDS instance and practicing, it’s important to delete the instance to avoid unnecessary costs.
In the RDS Dashboard, select your database instance and click on Delete.
AWS will ask if you want to take a snapshot before deletion (optional).
Click Continue and confirm deletion.
Remove Security Groups & Other Resources:

Optionally, remove any custom security groups or other resources you no longer need to keep your environment clean.
Key Tips:
Cost Management: Always monitor the free-tier usage to ensure you're not exceeding limits, especially with database storage, as RDS can quickly scale.
Backups: Regularly back up your database using Automated Backups or Manual Snapshots for disaster recovery.
Security: Use IAM roles and Security Groups to tightly control access to your RDS instance.
By following these steps, you can easily set up, connect to, and manage a MySQL database in AWS RDS for both development and production environments.






=================================================
ELB, ASG
=================================================

Welcome to this tutorial! Today, we’re talking about Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) in AWS.

What is Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)?
ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as:

EC2 instances
Containers
IP addresses
This ensures that no single server is overloaded, keeping your application responsive and available.

How ELB Ensures High Availability
ELB monitors the health of its registered targets.
It routes traffic only to healthy targets for better reliability.
Multi-AZ Deployment for High Availability
AWS has Availability Zones (AZs)—data centers in different geographical locations.
To ensure high availability, we deploy the same application across multiple AZs.
This way, if one AZ goes down, traffic is redirected to another healthy instance.

What Can ELB Distribute Traffic To?
EC2 Instances
Containers
IP addresses in different Availability Zones
Final Thoughts
By combining ELB with Auto Scaling Groups, we can ensure:
✅ Efficient traffic distribution
✅ Fault tolerance
✅ Scalability






5:30
================
Now, let’s talk about Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) in AWS.

What is AWS Auto Scaling?
ASG automates scaling based on demand. It can:

Launch new EC2 instances when traffic increases
Terminate instances when demand drops
Optimize resource usage to reduce costs
How ASG Works
One of the main goals of ASG is efficient resource utilization and cost minimization.
It automatically adjusts the number of instances based on traffic and predefined policies.

For example:

If CPU or memory usage exceeds 80%, ASG adds more instances to handle the load.
If usage drops below 30%, ASG removes instances to save costs.
Scaling Policies in ASG
We can define scaling rules based on:
✅ CPU or memory usage
✅ Custom metrics
✅ Scheduled scaling

This way, ASG dynamically scales up or down, ensuring performance while keeping costs under control.

That’s the basics of Auto Scaling! 






8:30
================
Let’s go over the different types of AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) and when to use them.

Types of AWS ELB
AWS offers several types of load balancers:

Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
ALB operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and is designed for routing web traffic.
It’s great for host-based or path-based routing and supports modern app architectures like microservices.

Network Load Balancer (NLB)
NLB works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and is built for high-performance traffic handling.
It can scale to millions of requests per second and is ideal for low-latency applications.

Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
GLB is used to deploy and manage third-party virtual appliances.
It distributes traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them automatically.

Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
CLB supports both Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) traffic.
It’s the older generation of ELB and is typically used for legacy applications.

Which One Should You Use?
For HTTP/HTTPS traffic, use Application Load Balancer (ALB).
For TCP/UDP traffic, use Network Load Balancer (NLB).
That’s a quick breakdown of AWS ELB types!





13:20
==========================
Now, let’s set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and see it in action!

Step 1: Understanding the Architecture
Here’s the architecture—we’re setting up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with an ALB.
To do this, we need multiple target instances.

Step 2: Launch Multiple EC2 Instances
We need multiple EC2 instances to act as our targets.
Let’s launch them now!

Step 3: Configure Security Groups
We need two security groups:

For ALB – allows traffic from users to ALB
For Instances – allows traffic from ALB to instances
Let’s define these security groups with inbound and outbound rules.

Step 4: Create a Target Group
A target group is a set of EC2 instances handling the same application.
To create it:
1️⃣ Select instance type
2️⃣ Give it a target group name
3️⃣ Set the instance port number
4️⃣ Define the health check path and port
5️⃣ Set health check thresholds

Step 5: Create the Load Balancer
1️⃣ Click Create Load Balancer
2️⃣ Choose Application Load Balancer (ALB) (since Network Load Balancer isn't free on the AWS Free Tier)
3️⃣ Set request source → We’ll choose Internet-facing
4️⃣ Select Availability Zones (AZs)
5️⃣ Attach the security group we created
6️⃣ Click Create

Step 6: ALB is Booting Up!
The ALB setup takes a few minutes.
Once ready, it will start distributing traffic to our EC2 instances automatically!






31:30
====================
Let’s dive into AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and understand how they help manage EC2 instances efficiently.

What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?
AWS Auto Scaling ensures that your application always has the right number of EC2 instances to handle traffic efficiently.
It automatically scales up when demand increases and scales down to save costs when demand drops.

Key Features of Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
✅ Automatic Scaling – Adjusts the number of instances based on real-time traffic.
✅ High Availability – Distributes instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to prevent failures.
✅ Cost Optimization – Ensures you pay only for what you use by dynamically adjusting resources.
✅ Health Monitoring – Replaces unhealthy instances automatically.

How ASG Works
An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) consists of:

Minimum Instances: The least number of instances that should always be running.
Desired Capacity: The target number of instances based on normal workload.
Maximum Instances: The highest number of instances ASG can scale up to during peak load.
Example Scenario
Let’s say you configure an ASG with:
🔹 Min: 1 instance (always running)
🔹 Desired: 2 instances (normal traffic)
🔹 Max: 4 instances (handles peak demand)

If traffic increases, ASG automatically launches more instances up to the max limit.
If traffic drops, ASG terminates excess instances, reducing costs.
If an instance fails, ASG replaces it automatically to maintain availability.
Scaling Policies in ASG
You can configure ASG to scale based on:
📌 CPU or Memory Usage – Example: If CPU usage exceeds 80%, ASG adds instances.
📌 Traffic Load – If requests per second increase, ASG scales up.
📌 Scheduled Scaling – Scale up during business hours and scale down at night.

Get Started with AWS ASG
Want to set up your own Auto Scaling Group?
Check out the official AWS documentation:
📌 AWS ASG Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html




33:30
=====================
Great! Our Application Load Balancer (ALB) provisioning is complete, and it's now up and running.

Accessing the Load Balancer
To test it, we need to use the public DNS of our ALB.
Let’s open a browser and paste the ALB DNS URL.

✅ Success! We have access to the server.

Testing Load Balancing
Now, let’s refresh the browser multiple times.
Each request is sent to either Server-1 or Server-2, and we can see ALB distributing the traffic.

💡 By default, ALB uses the Round Robin algorithm, meaning requests are evenly sent to all available instances.

Wrapping Up
That’s it! We’ve successfully:
✔️ Set up Application Load Balancer (ALB)
✔️ Configured Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
✔️ Tested traffic distribution across multiple servers

This is how AWS ALB and ASG work together to ensure scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency.

Thanks for watching!

Once the function is created, scroll down to the Code Source section.

Example 1: Hello World (Python)
Replace the default code with this simple Lambda function:

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from AWS Lambda!')
    }
📌 Click "Deploy" to save changes.

🔹 Step 4: Test the Lambda Function
📌 Click "Test"
📌 Create a new test event with a name like TestEvent
📌 Use the following JSON event data:
{
    "message": "This is a test"
}
📌 Click "Create", then click "Test" again.

✅ If successful, you should see:
Response:
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "\"Hello from AWS Lambda!\""
}
🔹 Step 5: Trigger the Lambda Function Automatically
AWS Lambda can be triggered by various AWS services. Here are three common triggers:

1️⃣ API Gateway (Creating a Serverless API)
📌 Go to Amazon API Gateway
📌 Create a new REST API
📌 Add a New Resource and select Lambda Function Integration
📌 Deploy the API and get a public API endpoint

✅ Now, when you make a request to the API, it will trigger the Lambda function!

2️⃣ S3 Trigger (Run Lambda on File Upload)
📌 Go to Amazon S3
📌 Create a new bucket or use an existing one
📌 In Lambda Triggers, select S3, then choose "All object create events"

✅ Every time a file is uploaded, AWS Lambda will execute automatically!

3️⃣ CloudWatch Events (Scheduled Lambda Execution)
📌 Go to Amazon CloudWatch
📌 Create a new Rule
📌 Select Event Source → "Schedule"
📌 Define a schedule (e.g., run every 5 minutes)
📌 Attach the Lambda function as the Target

✅ This will automatically run the Lambda function at regular intervals!

🔹 Step 6: Monitoring Lambda Execution
📌 Go to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
📌 Find your Lambda function’s log group
📌 Check execution logs, errors, and performance metrics

🔹 Step 7: Optimize Lambda for Performance
💡 Best Practices for AWS Lambda:
✅ Keep function lightweight – Avoid unnecessary dependencies
✅ Set memory & timeout – Optimize performance & cost
✅ Use environment variables – Store configuration settings
✅ Enable concurrency limits – Avoid overloading resources

🔹 Final Thoughts
That’s it! You’ve successfully created, tested, and automated AWS Lambda.
🚀 AWS Lambda is a powerful tool for building serverless applications, automating tasks, and integrating AWS services.

11| AWS Queue and Streams | Route53 and CDN
=================================================

in this tutoriao we talk about AWS Queue and Streams | Route53 and CDN.

lets start with WS Queue and Streams:
Messaging and integration services that facilitate asynchronous communication between different components of a distributed system.
this just like RabitMQ/activeMQ message broker.

its simeple mechanisms: producers product message, put it a queue and consumer consume message from then queue.
this is a asynchronous system, where preducer and consumer not directly cuple and not tightly coup.

Thsi system good for distribution system. like a e-chomers system. 
where may multiple generate some event or message and multiple consume this message or process thsi event 
asynchronously.

aws provide services:
Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS and Kinesis are queue and streaming services that are highly scalable, 
simple to use, and don't require you to set up message brokers.


we can also use this service with differetn programming language and sdk is there.
we can intragrate this sdk in our developemnt of any software and interact with aws with oru software.

service are manage services so we dont have to do many thing in manually, 
you can get more details in aws official document.

how you build a code for sent message to queuaq, how receive etc all example is there in aws documentation.



as it aws manage srvices so the serice take care by aws and we jsut use and only bill for how many we sue it.




10:20
=========================
Lets see more details about Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS):
SQS is designed for reliable and scalable message queuing. Producers send messages to a queue, and consumers retrieve messages 
from the queue. .


Key Features:

Provides a reliable, highly scalable, and fully managed message queue service.
Offers standard queues for high throughput and best-effort ordering.
Suitable for decoupling and scaling microservices.





11:00
=========================
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS):

SNS is often used for the publish/subscribe model, where producers (publishers) send messages to a topic, and multiple consumers (subscribers) receive those messages. 


Key Features:

Enables message and notification delivery to a large number of subscribers or endpoints.
Supports publish/subscribe and fan-out scenarios, where a message published to a topic can be sent to multiple subscribers.
Integrates with other AWS services, allowing you to automatically trigger actions based on events.


AWS SDK Doc Link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_sqs_code_examples.html



12:10
=========================
lets talk about Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:

Kinesis Data Streams allows you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data in real-time. 

Key Features:

Supports the creation of data streams to which producers can publish data, and consumers can subscribe to process the data.
Enables real-time processing and analytics on streaming data.
Integrates with various AWS services for downstream processing and storage.



13:40
==================
Lets see an hand-on example of aws sqs sns step by step.






21:40
======================
now talking about Route53 and CDN.

Route 53 allows you to register and manage domain names (e.g., example.com) directly through the service.


Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to route end-user requests to globally distributed endpoints—whether those endpoints are in AWS or elsewhere.

key features and concepts:

Health Checks:
Route 53 can monitor the health of your resources and It can automatically adjust routing based on the health status.

Integration with AWS Services:
Route 53 integrates seamlessly with other AWS services. For example, you can use it to route traffic to resources like  EC2, ELB.


Logs and Monitoring:
Route 53 provides detailed logs that include information about DNS queries, responses, and health checks. You can use these logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Private DNS:
Route 53 supports private DNS, allowing you to create DNS records that are only accessible within your Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).

Traffic Flow Visualizations:
Route 53 provides visualizations of the traffic flow, which can be helpful in understanding how DNS queries are being routed.




Routing Policies: Route 53 supports various routing policies, enabling you to define how traffic should be routed to your resources. 

Simple Routing: Maps a domain to a single resource.
Weighted Routing: Distributes traffic based on specified weights.
Geolocation Routing: Directs traffic based on the geographic location of the user.
Latency-based Routing: Directs traffic based on the lowest latency for end-users.
Failover Routing: Routes traffic to a standby resource in case the primary resource is unhealthy.
IP-based routing policy is a network configuration strategy that directs incoming network traffic to specific destinations based on the Use and server location.



now talking CDN:
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a content delivery network (CDN) service known as Amazon CloudFront. 
CloudFront is a globally distributed CDN that helps businesses deliver content, including web pages, videos, images, and other assets, 
with low latency and high transfer speeds.





=================================================
12 | AWS Networking | 1
=================================================   

In this tutoraial we taling about AWS Networking

AWS provides a variety of services designed to assist cloud consumers in establishing and maintaining network connectivity 
and security for their applications, both on-premises and in the cloud. These services include EC2, DB, and S3, among others.


Like we can think network required for a typical system:
application in a secure lan and  like database server in a lan 
user access this appliances throw a Gateway. 
we can diesign this type ntework in aws with proper security.



2:10
======================
Hybrid Networking:

In a hybrid network Organizations can connect their on-premises data centers to cloud using private Link, VPN or Internet.





3:28
======================
details about AWS networking key services and components.


we can see more derails in this link:

https://aws.amazon.com/products/networking/



Amazon Route 53:
A scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end-user requests to globally distributed AWS resources. For Domain Registration, Health Checks and Traffic Flow control.

Client VPN: Allows remote users to securely connect to AWS resources.


AWS Transit Gateway:
Simplifies network architecture and management by providing a hub-and-spoke model for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.





7:50
======================
lets talk about aws vpc in more details:

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

Amazon VPC enables you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud, providing you with full control over the virtual network environment.

Subnets: VPCs can be divided into subnets, allowing you to group resources based on security and operational requirements.
Route Tables: Control the traffic between subnets using route tables.
Internet Gateway (IGW): Allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.



before do handon practice we have to know some point:
    AWS reserved 5 (Five) IP address from each Subnet:

    The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for your use, its reserved.

    10.0.0.0: Network address.
    10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
    10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for DNS.
    10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
    10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address (not support broadcast in a VPC). 






12:00
================

Public Subnet:

A public subnet is a subnet that has a route to the internet, typically through an Internet Gateway (IGW).
Common use cases for public subnets include hosting web servers, load balancers, and other resources that need to be publicly accessible.

Private Subnet:

A private subnet is a subnet that does not have a direct route to the internet. It is isolated from the internet by default.
Common use cases for private subnets include databases, application servers, and other resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet.





15:50
=================
NAT Gateway/NAT Instance:

Instances in the private subnet do not have public IP addresses and rely on a NAT gateway or NAT instance for 
outbound internet access. Allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while
preventing inbound traffic from the internet.



Bastion host:

A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the Internet. 








=================================================
12 | AWS Networking | 2
=================================================
In thsi tutorial we see step by step process of Create aws VPC.

lets start, for thst we going to go aws console dashboar. find vpc.
here we a defautl vpc if we not create any of thsi and some of subnet.



we can create vpc and its subnet etc one by one or all at one for that we use vpc and more.


3:40
==================
lets do it.

give a name, then 
ipv4 subnet.
select AZ


so here we get:
one vpc and its has two subnet.
two reoute table for private and public subnet. and public one connect with  gateway.

finally cliecm create pvc.
details status will show here.
here we can see crateed  a vpc its dns ,
subnet created gateway created 
routed created adn asocated with this subnet adn its route table.

this is how we can able to create all at a time.


7:10
========================
vpc create done, lets check it from aws consile manue how its look like and its component.



8:30
=====================
now lets run a ec2 in public subent what is we able to access from out side of aws as it public network.
if we run any serive in private subnet we not able to access this from out side aws.




lets crate ec2 firsr:
to do that give a ec2 name.
select os , key pair, 
now we have to select a vpc in this case we select wath vpc we jsutr created.
and select public network.



security group are directly related to pvc, so we have to create new security grpup in this vpc.

and lucnh this ec2 with this security grpup.
its its run done.

lets try to access for outside of aws like throw ping.
we cna do a ssh.
for that we have to open termingl in the same locaktion where is .pem file is.

the we use public ip. 
and doen we successfully ssh to ec2.
lets run a curl command to goodle to ech public connection.
yes we get it, google howm page ! and its work perfictly.



15:30
==================
Lets run another ec2 in a private subnet.

same step we know it:
give ec2 nanme, select os , select security grpup etc.
run it.
run done.

let see derails , its has now public ip, and we are not able to connect to ths private subnet ec2.



19:00
======================
lets clear now bastion host concep now with an exmple.
lets it step by step exmple.

for thsit we have to copy the .pem file form my local pc to the aws public host.

the we gonna use it to ssh to our private subnet ec2.
done.

now do ssh to private ec2, done yes now we can able to ssh to our private subnet host with bastion host mechanism.

=================================================
16 | Project run on AWS
=================================================
iN THIS tutorial we will working with a real-world project deploy in aws, Its a three tier application.
 what is have a fonted, backend and a database server.

 Here is a three tier system diagram, our propose application will be same.
 here we deploy fronend to a public subnet and backend and database will on a private subnet.

From this example we get a proper idea about an application how we can run and deploy in aws.



1:30
===============
Lets start from databasew server.
Create a mysql database, you can flow on screen step by step guid.


3:00
====================
Start from createing security group. In your real project may production you better use custome vpc and security grup.
in my case here i ma using defautl vpc and create security grup for databae.

lets crate it same as previous:
    give a name
    set inbount/outbount rule.
for now we keep source ip 0000 inboud rule for testing perpose using a clietn from my pc.
after testing we remove it, and out database server will private again.


now we create securty group for application servver:
    here we set access or http and ssh.


now lets create mysql databae step by step:
    give dtabase name
    set root user credentials 
    for now testing perpose allow public access.
    assign security grpup.
    finally click create button. 
its take few time.

in the mean time we cna create a ec2 for application server.
same process as:
    give instance name select os, assign security grpupp etc
    then luch it.

Okey now our databasew and application server is ready now.



10:10
====================
we can deploy any type application on ths application server.
here i am going to use a java/spring  project.

here is idea as:
    here will have a database name of simple db, and table name is book and we will insetn adn retrieve data form thsi table on aws database.
    and this application expose couple of rest endpoine to connect we this databawse.



Lets connect with database form my local pc useing dns:
 copy the dns and create a connection in mysql workbranch client.
 and yes we able to successfully make connetion.

so now we connect to our aws mysql database server.
lets create a schema name: simple.

do make connect we going to use database dns in out application to connect with it.
adn credentials set done.

we get book table in database, lets insert some data manually in database.
oke insertion done.



15:30
==================
lets build and make package our appliation  and copy this package from my local machine to aws applicaton server ec2.

fitst of all we ned to ready our applicaton ready to java application 
for thst we need to install java package in my application server.
lets do it.

ok install deone, check java version and we get it.


lets make a directory for application call app.
geive it to permission.

Now make a scp command to copy application from my local machine to aws server.
copy done.


23:20
==============
we ready to run our application and lets run it now.
yes our application sucessfully run done.

now we have to access data from our database threow my application rest API\.
lets check it from browser.
to ensure lets add another row in seide this book table get retrevive it.
yes we get it.
