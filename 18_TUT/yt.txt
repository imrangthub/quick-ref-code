All right. We're good. Lets next step.


The update is done.
Update completed.
Update is finished.


Nothing fancy here!
The steps are similar, what we did before!
Nothing fancy here!
The process is almost the same as before!


Our three-tier application is fully set up and working as expected!
Our apps is fully functional!

This is the Dockerfile, let’s check it out!
This is our Dockerfile. Let’s take a closer look!

For that, you need to first create an account on DockerHub.
To do that, you need to first create an account on DockerHub.

So here I am, using cat and echo to interact with the container.
So, I'm using cat and echo to interact with the container.

For that, I'm gonna do docker ps.

To remove a container, I will run docker rm.

Look at the UbuntuImage. The tag you see is the release version.
Check out the image. The tag indicates the release version.


We'll coverThis In more detail in the Images&Containers section.
We'll cover DockerNetworks with more detail in a dedicated section, so don't worry if it's not clear yet!
We'll go deeper into DockerNetworks in a dedicated section, so it's fine if it's not fully clear yet!

 

Many more cases to explore, This is gonna be a long one.


You Gotta emphasize that.
You need to emphasize that.
#Need to Foucse on topic




Let me explain.

Lemme tell you guys something, this is too easy really easy.
This is a great way to clarify these concepts.


If you're Like me, you're a moring person, and you like taking exam early in the morning.


He say, "Well, I need them to do help desk".
And youre like, "Well I need them to do my project".
Boom, clash !


So, a lot of people have this confusion that, if that: "I dont have the title of being a project manager"
You dont have to be official project manager.
And the another question that people say to me: 
"Hey, I amd only work on my project , its a small project", that's fine too.


When you say stakeholder, you'r talking anyone that's affected by the actual project.
It's not a small term, It's a broad term.
Now, thinking about this, I’d like to mention that stakeholders could be either positively or negatively affected.


We’re all set! 
Our container is up and running!
Simply open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application in action.


Here, you need to be more careful and more attentive.
You may exceed the free tier hours and start getting charged on your account, so be careful.
You need to keep a close eye on this, otherwise you may face unexpected bills.

##HowThis think Work | end-of-topic
=================================================
Now, the way Docker networking works is:
You always start with a network, Every container runs within a network.
By default, it uses the bridge network.

When you create additional containers, you can connect them to this network,
allowing them to communicate with each other.
Each container gets an IP address, and Docker manages the routing automatically.
That’s the basics of Docker networking.
Now, there are a few other things I want to show with Docker networks here.






=================================================
##What is cover last video and start with what topic
=================================================
v1
====
So what have we done so far in this section?
We have created some networks and run containers within these networks.
In the last video, I run containers with a network, arranged them in order, and built a three-tier project.


v2
====
In this video, I amd gonna talk about the measurment performance domian.
Now, In the last one, I talked about the delivery performance domain.
In ones before that I talked about work and Planing.

##ForGoogleing: | docuement-checking
=================================================
So i'm gonna go to google.

I'm gonna go right here and i wanna show your guys this.

So, this is the Docker offcial documentation.
