All right. We're good. Lets next step.


The update is done.
Update completed.
Update is finished.


Nothing fancy here!
The steps are similar, what we did before!

Nothing fancy here!
The process is almost the same as before!


Our three-tier application is fully set up and working as expected!
Our apps is fully functional!

This is the Dockerfile, let’s check it out!
This is our Dockerfile. Let’s take a closer look!

For that, you need to first create an account on DockerHub.
To do that, you need to first create an account on DockerHub.

So here I am, using cat and echo to interact with the container.
So, I'm using cat and echo to interact with the container.

For that, I'm gonna do docker ps.

To remove a container, I will run docker rm.

Look at the UbuntuImage. The tag you see is the release version.
Check out the image. The tag indicates the release version.


We will coverThis In more detail in the Images&Containers section.
We will cover DockerNetworks with more detail in a dedicated section, so don't worry if it's not clear yet!
We will go deeper into DockerNetworks in a dedicated section, so it's fine if it's not fully clear yet!

 

Many more cases to explore, This is gonna be a long one.
You Gotta emphasize that.
You need to emphasize that.
#Need to Foucse on topic




Let me explain.
Lemme tell you guys something, this is easy really easy.
This is a great way to clarify these concepts.


If you're Like me, you're a moring person, and you like taking exam early in the morning.


He say, "Well, I need them to do help desk".
And youre like, "Well I need them to do my project".
Boom, clash !


So, a lot of people have this confusion that, If that: "I dont have the title of being a project manager"
You dont have to be official project manager.
And the another question that people say to me: 
"Hey, I am only work on my project , its a small project", that's fine too.


When you say stakeholder, you'r talking anyone that's affected by the actual project.
It's not a small term, It's a broad term.
Now, thinking about this, I’d like to mention that stakeholders could be either positively or negatively affected.


We’re all set! 
Our container is up and running!
Simply open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application in action.


Here, you need to be more careful and more attentive.
You may exceed the free tier hours and start getting charged on your account, so be careful.
You need to keep a close eye on this, otherwise you may face unexpected bills.

##WelcomeTut
=================================================
Hey Guys, 
    Welcome to this tutorial on Docker.
If you are new to Docker, and want to learn Docker from scratch you’re in the right place.

In this tutorial, I'll explain Docker from the very beginning.
What is docker, how this docker thing works, why it’s so popular, and definitely TheEasyWay!

##ToStartTopic:
=================================================
ToStartTopic1
------------------ 
Hello and welcome back!
In this tutorial, we are gonna see how to install Docker on Windows.
This one will be super exciting, it's our first step into Docker!
So, let's get started!


ToStartTopic2
------------------
In this section, we will explore commonly used Docker commands and practice using them.
This is where the Docker adventure begins!
So, grab your coffee, get comfortable, and let’s dive into the world of Docker!



=================================================
##HowThis think Work 
=================================================
Here’s how Docker networking works: 
    You always start with a network, and every container runs inside a network. 
    By default, Docker uses the bridge network.

So, here’s the deal with Docker networking: 
    every container needs a network to run in. By default, Docker uses the bridge network.

##What is cover last video and start with what topic
=================================================

v1
====
In this video, I'm going to talk about the  Performance domain. 
In the previous video, I covered the Delivery domain, and before that, I discussed the Planning domains.

v2
===
So in this video, I’ll be covering Measurement Performance.
Previously, I talked about Delivery Performance, and before that, I discussed the Planning domains.


v3
====
Alright, let’s look at what we’ve done so far. We created a few networks and ran containers inside them. 
In the last video, I ran some containers on a network, organized them, and built a three-tier project.




=================================================
##ForGoogleing: | docuement-checking
=================================================
So, I'm going to open Google and type 'Docker Hub'. Just like that. And we're gonna press enter on it.
The first link says 'Docker Hub', and it should lead to the official Docker Hub site.
Let’s click on it—now check this out.
This is the official Docker documentation.

Now, what exactly is it?
Well, it shows a list of images—both official ones and those created by individuals.
And this is the resource that gives us everything we need to know about Docker images and containers.
