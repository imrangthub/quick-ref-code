Gotta emphasize that.
#Need to Foucse on topic

This is gonna be a long one.
#For Logger video


This is a great way to bake (bāk) in these concepts.


Let me explain.


Lemme tell you guys something, this is too easy really easy.


I will be going over the different types of questions you will see on your PMP exam.

I will review the different types of questions you will see on your PMP exam.


So there are a couple of other things i want to show with DockerContienr here.


If you're Like me and you're a moring person, and you like taking exam early in the morning.


He say, Well, I need them to do help desk.
And youre like, Well I need them to do my project.
Boom, clash !


So, a lot of people have this confusion that if that: I dont have the title of being a project manager.
You dont have to be official project manager.

And the another question that people say to me: 
"Hey, I amd only work on my project , its a small project", that's fine too.


It's not a small term, It's a broad term.
When you say stakeholder, you'r talking anyone that's affected by the actual project.
Now, thinking about this, I wanna mention that stakeholders could be positive or negatively effected.


Now we just finish completing all of the processes the you would use to create your scope.
So in this part we're gonna look at what processes are we gonna use to create oru schedule.


So, grab your coffee, get comfortable, and let’s dive into the world of Docker!"
Alright, let’s dive in and get started!"

Hello and welcome back in this section we are going to take a look 
at a super commonly asked interview question the LinkList !
This will be the first dataStrecture we build in the cousere.

We are going to take a look at: What the are, how they work how they compare to array how to bu8ild our 
own and then go over some really key fundamental things for you to know during your interview.
So let's start by taking a liik at what a linked list is.


Now the way linkList work is:- you always start with the very first element.
this one is a bit special. It's called the head.
When you add subsequent nodes, all you do is you create a new node and then 
have the previous pointer point to it via its nest pointer here.

That's the linkList.





=================================================
##What is cover last video and start with what topic
=================================================
So what have we done so far in this section?
So far, we created thos activities, we defined them.
The last video, I sequenced them, i put them in an order and  I build the project schedule network diagrame.


In this video, I amd gonna talk about the measurment performance domian.
Now, In the last one, I talked about the delivery performance domain.
In ones before that I talked about work and Planing.
